**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Solitary Craft and the Need for Community

***"I've chosen to do a very solitary line of work. My craft is a solitary one. I spend my days time managing between doing freelance work and what I truly love to do because what I truly love to do doesn't pay the bills."***

The life of a historian and biographer exists in profound tension between isolation and connection. The actual work—the hours spent in archives, the solitary reading, the wrestling with narrative structure, the painful process of writing—demands complete withdrawal from the world. Yet this very isolation makes community essential for survival, both professional and personal.

Narani Basu's career exemplifies this paradox. She spends her days managing multiple freelance projects simultaneously—manuscript mentoring, ghostwriting, editing—all while pursuing the biographical work that truly drives her. This juggling act is not merely about financial necessity, though that is certainly real. It represents a deeper truth about creative work in India: the things we love rarely pay the bills, and the hustle required to maintain a writing life can threaten to consume the very space needed for that writing.

The community she has built serves multiple functions. First, it provides practical support—friends who understand when she vanishes into a project for weeks, who hold space for her return, who show up at 2 AM if needed. Second, it offers emotional grounding. Most of her close friends work outside her field, which helps her maintain perspective and stay connected to life beyond the archives. Third, it creates accountability and encouragement. When self-doubt threatens—and it always does—these relationships remind her that her work matters and that she is capable.

The intentionality with which she approaches friendship is striking. She maintains office hours (9-5:30, no weekends) despite being a freelancer, ensuring time for both work and relationships. She makes a point of meeting friends in person every two weeks to a month, recognizing that digital connection, while valuable, cannot fully replace physical presence. She has learned to be vulnerable with friends, to share not just successes but struggles, to ask for help when needed.

This approach to friendship as essential infrastructure for creative work challenges the romantic notion of the solitary genius. The reality is that sustained creative output requires a support system. The question is whether we build that system intentionally or stumble into it by accident. Basu has chosen intentionality, and it has made all the difference in her ability to maintain both productivity and sanity in a demanding field.

## 2. The Evolution from Shyness to Confidence

***"I was absolutely opposite. I was a very shy child. During my kindergarten days I was a bit of a naughty child, but that went away as I grew older. Somewhere in my teens I became a very shy child and that stayed right through college."***

The transformation from a painfully shy student who couldn't speak in extempore competitions to a confident public intellectual and biographer represents one of the most significant personal journeys in Basu's life. This evolution was neither linear nor inevitable—it required specific circumstances, supportive relationships, and considerable time.

In school, she was the student teachers worried about. Her house teacher told her mother that if she couldn't speak in a simple house competition, how would she manage in college when public speaking would be required? The anxiety was real and paralyzing. During her undergraduate years at St. Stephen's College, she was a backbencher, largely invisible, feeling like a misfit in that particular environment. She barely opened her mouth, and few people remember her from that period.

The shift began during her master's program at Delhi University, where she felt more at ease with who she was becoming. The environment was less intimidating, and she began to discover that people actually enjoyed talking to her. But the full realization that she could be a public-facing intellectual came much later, during her research on VP Menon. It was then that she discovered people wanted to know not just about her work but about what made her tick as a person and a thinker.

Several factors contributed to this transformation. First, she found her subject matter—history, particularly biographical history—which gave her something substantive to talk about beyond small talk. When you have deep knowledge and genuine passion for a subject, speaking becomes easier because you're not performing; you're sharing something you care about.

Second, she encountered mentors and friends who actively encouraged her voice. Her agent Kaneshka Gupta repeatedly told her to "figure it out" when faced with new challenges, forcing her to develop confidence through action. Editor Supriya Nair's enthusiasm for her work on CB Mutama helped her rediscover joy in her craft after the trauma of the VP Menon book's controversial reception.

Third, she learned that vulnerability and authenticity are strengths, not weaknesses. Through friendships with people like Lakshana, she discovered that sharing doubts and fears doesn't diminish you—it deepens connections and makes you more relatable. This realization extended to her professional life, where she learned to write and speak with honesty rather than trying to project an image of scholarly authority she didn't feel.

The journey from shy child to confident professional took decades, and traces of that earlier shyness remain. She still feels nervous before public speaking engagements and still experiences imposter syndrome. But she has learned to act despite these feelings, to recognize them as normal rather than disqualifying. The confidence she has developed is not the absence of doubt but the ability to function effectively in its presence.

## 3. The Apprenticeship in History

***"I began loving history in school and that was largely due to a class teacher of mine, Mrs. Rose Jacob, and she was fabulous in that she taught history like it was a story. She didn't teach it like it was this roll call of dates and names and wars that were fought. She taught it to us like it was like a movie happening."***

The foundation of Basu's approach to historical writing was laid by a single teacher who understood that history is fundamentally about storytelling. Mrs. Rose Jacob taught history not as a series of facts to be memorized but as a narrative to be experienced, as events unfolding with drama and consequence. This early exposure to history as story rather than data shaped everything that followed in Basu's career.

However, the path from loving history to becoming a historian was neither straight nor obvious. When she actually studied history in college, she hated it. The academic approach—dense theoretical frameworks, blocks of years studied in isolation, heavy conceptual apparatus—drained the life from the subject she loved. Add to this her personal awkwardness as a teenager and her sense of being a misfit, and the college years were "fairly nightmarish."

The love of history returned in her twenties through reading—particularly biographies and autobiographies. She discovered that these works revealed not just what happened but why it happened, showing how individual personalities, quirks, and decisions shaped historical outcomes. A biography could show you how someone's childhood experiences influenced their later choices, how a bad marriage might affect political decisions, how personal ambition intersected with historical necessity.

This reading shaped her understanding of what historical writing could be. She was drawn to works that combined rigorous research with compelling narrative, that made the past feel immediate and relevant. Peter Clark's biography of Stafford Cripps stood out for including details like Cripps's fondness for knitting and nudity—quirks that made him memorable as a person, not just a political figure.

When she began her own historical work, she had to learn the craft from scratch. She didn't have a PhD, which meant she lacked the formal training most historians receive. Everything—how to navigate archives, how to parse through research, when to stop researching, what to include and exclude—had to be figured out through trial and error.

The National Archives proved particularly challenging. It's a labyrinth where you must figure out which index to consult, which subheading to check, which cross-reference to follow. Files might be "NT" (not traceable or not transferred), might have been taken by monkeys (literally), might be empty despite being listed, or might simply not exist. On any given day, you face twenty-five dead ends. Learning to navigate this frustration, to persist despite constant obstacles, became part of her apprenticeship.

A crucial breakthrough came in 2016 at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) in London, where she found recordings of VP Menon speaking in Harry Hodson's private collection. Hearing her subject's actual voice transformed her understanding of how to write biography. She realized she wanted his voice to feature prominently in the telling, which introduced her to the power of oral history—something she hadn't encountered before.

The craft of writing itself required separate learning. She had to develop a style that was accessible without being simplistic, scholarly without being academic, engaging without sacrificing accuracy. She wanted her books to be something anyone could pick up and learn from, not just specialists. This meant avoiding the turgid prose that characterizes much academic history, while maintaining the rigor that makes historical work credible.

Her approach crystallized around a simple principle inherited from Mrs. Rose Jacob: you're telling a story to people. Every biography is fundamentally a story about a person—what shaped them, what drove them, what they achieved, how they failed. The historical context matters, the political implications matter, but at the center is always a human being making choices in specific circumstances.

## 4. The Economics of Historical Writing

***"I was broke for five years until a friend of my mother's introduced me to my agent Kaneshka Gupta and it was completely by chance and it came completely at a time when I had lost all hope."***

The romantic image of the historian or biographer obscures a harsh economic reality: this work rarely pays enough to live on. Basu's journey from quitting her policy analyst job in 2012 to publishing her first book in 2020 involved eight years of financial precarity, hustle, and uncertainty that would have broken many people.

When she quit her job at 25 to write about VP Menon, she had no book deal, no clear path forward, and no financial cushion. Her mother supported the decision but was clear: "You're going to have to figure out how you want to finance yourself because we can't do that for you and it's not going to be easy." This was not cruelty but realism. If she wanted to pursue this unconventional path, she would have to make it work.

For five years, she worked as a research assistant to various professors, earning 20,000-25,000 rupees per month for archival research. This was barely enough to survive in Delhi. There were times when she had to choose between metro fare home and buying a samosa and chai at the canteen. She couldn't go out with friends who had regular jobs and disposable income. The sense of low self-worth during this period was crippling—watching peers progress in their careers while she struggled to make ends meet.

The breakthrough came in 2017 when her agent helped her put together a book proposal for the VP Menon biography. But even after getting a book deal, the advance wasn't enough to live on while writing. She continued doing research assistant work, continued hustling for every rupee. The book was published in February 2020, just before the pandemic, and she had no idea if it was doing well because lockdown immediately followed.

During the pandemic, with archives closed, she couldn't continue as a research assistant. Her agent gave her first manuscript mentoring assignment—working with a writer who needed guidance through a manuscript. She had never done this before and said so. His response: "Figure it out." This became a pattern. He would bring her clients for ghostwriting, for editing, for various projects, and each time she would say she didn't know how to do it, and each time he would tell her to figure it out.

Through trial and error, she built a freelance model that could sustain her. She realized she needed at least one long-term retainer client and two to three short-term projects running simultaneously to ensure steady income. She couldn't work gig to gig with gaps in between—the anxiety was too much. This meant sometimes juggling five projects at once, which was exhausting but necessary.

The work itself is demanding. Manuscript mentoring requires deep engagement with someone else's work, helping them shape their narrative while respecting their voice. Ghostwriting means writing entire books in someone else's voice, across different genres, while simultaneously working on her own books. Editing requires meticulous attention to detail and the ability to improve work without imposing your own style.

She maintains strict boundaries to preserve sanity: office hours of 9-5:30, no working on weekends. This discipline is remarkable for a freelancer, where the temptation is always to work more, to take on more projects, to never stop hustling. But she recognized early that without these boundaries, she would burn out completely.

The financial model she has built is precarious but functional. The freelance work pays the bills. The biographical work—what she truly loves—doesn't pay enough to live on but provides professional satisfaction and builds her reputation. The two exist in tension, each taking time and energy from the other, but together they make a sustainable (if exhausting) career.

What she would like is to reach a point where she doesn't need five simultaneous projects, where she can be more selective about the freelance work she takes on. But she's also realistic: writing books alone won't get her there. The economics of publishing in India, particularly for serious non-fiction, simply don't support full-time authorship for most writers.

This economic reality shapes everything about how historians and biographers work in India. It determines who can afford to enter the field (those with family support or other income sources), how long projects take (research must be squeezed around paying work), what subjects get covered (those that might attract advances or prizes), and who persists long enough to build a career.

Basu's honesty about these economics is valuable. Too often, successful writers present a sanitized version of their journey, obscuring the years of struggle and the ongoing financial juggling. By being frank about the hustle, the poverty, the constant anxiety about money, she provides a realistic picture of what this career actually entails.

## 5. The Craft of Biographical Writing

***"At the heart of it, I think Rose ma'am taught me one very simple thing which is essentially that you're telling a story to people. My main aim is I need to tell the story of this person, I need to tell the story of the time they were living in."***

The art of biographical writing requires balancing multiple competing demands: historical accuracy, narrative drive, analytical insight, and accessibility. Basu has developed a distinctive approach that prioritizes storytelling without sacrificing scholarly rigor, that makes complex historical periods comprehensible without oversimplifying them.

Her fundamental principle is simple: biography is storytelling. You're not just presenting facts about a person's life; you're crafting a narrative that helps readers understand who this person was, what shaped them, what drove them, how they navigated their particular historical moment. This means paying attention to the small details that reveal character—childhood experiences, family dynamics, personal quirks, private doubts—alongside the big public achievements.

The structure of her biographies reflects this storytelling approach. She typically begins not with the subject's birth but with a moment or scene that captures something essential about them. The VP Menon book famously opens with him as a boy setting his school on fire—a cinematic moment that immediately establishes him as someone who doesn't follow conventional paths. The Panikkar book begins with his prehistory, introducing his remarkable grandmother and uncle, establishing the family context that shaped him.

Within this narrative framework, she weaves together multiple threads: personal development, intellectual evolution, political context, social change. She shows how Panikkar's thinking about Indian identity evolved from his time at Oxford through his work with princely states to his diplomatic career, how each phase built on and modified what came before. She doesn't present his ideas as static positions but as dynamic responses to changing circumstances.

The prose itself is carefully crafted to be elegant without being ornate, clear without being simplistic. Consider this sentence about the Maharaja of Alwar: "The Maharaja of Alwar for instance may have been a charmer and a pedophile and a man capable of setting his polo pony on fire when it didn't perform as he wanted it to. But he was also acutely aware of his constitutional rights based on the Government of India Act 1919." The sentence does multiple things simultaneously: it establishes character through shocking details, it uses rhythm and structure for emphasis, and it pivots to make a serious analytical point about princely state politics.

She makes extensive use of quotations, both from her subjects and from contemporaries, to bring voices directly into the narrative. But she's selective about which quotes to use and how to present them. She wants quotes that are vivid and revealing, not just informative. When Panikkar describes his uncle's daily routine—bathing in ice-cold water, swallowing his pellet of opium, eating roasted grain—these details come directly from his memoir and paint a memorable picture.

The research underlying the narrative is exhaustive but largely invisible in the final text. She doesn't burden readers with extensive footnotes or methodological discussions. The scholarship is there—in the accuracy of details, the nuance of interpretation, the breadth of sources consulted—but it's integrated into the storytelling rather than displayed separately.

One of her key decisions is what to leave out. Biography could easily become encyclopedic, trying to cover every aspect of a subject's life. But this produces unreadable books. She makes choices about what matters most for understanding her subject. With Panikkar, she had to leave out much of his Malayalam literary work because she lacked the language skills to analyze it properly and because including it would have made an already long book unwieldy.

She's also thoughtful about how to handle her subjects' flaws and failures. Neither VP Menon nor Panikkar were saints. Both had problematic views on various issues, both made significant mistakes, both had personal failings. She doesn't shy away from these but presents them in context, showing how they were products of their time while also noting when they were problematic even by contemporary standards.

The goal is to produce biographies that work on multiple levels. For general readers, they should be engaging narratives about fascinating people living through extraordinary times. For scholars, they should offer new insights based on original research and thoughtful analysis. For students of history, they should demonstrate how individual lives intersect with broader historical forces. Achieving all three simultaneously is difficult, but it's what distinguishes great biography from merely competent biography.

## 6. Panikkar's Formative Years and Family Background

***"His grandmother is this very gentle figure, almost maternal in his memory. She was the one who used to tell him stories. They used to play games together. She taught him the Malayalam alphabet. When he was naughty and tied up to a pillar by his tutor because he wrote a love poem for a local girl, she used to sneak out and untie him."***

KM Panikkar's early life was shaped by a remarkable family that combined traditional Kerala values with progressive aspirations. His grandmother, Kungi Piljori, emerges as a particularly important figure—gentle, nurturing, secretly subversive in her support of the young boy's rebellious tendencies. Her brother, Arai Kesava, was an engineering marvel who reclaimed land from Vembanad Lake and diverted rivers, a rare feat that established the family's reputation for capability and ambition.

The family dynamics were complex. Panikkar's mother was a disciplinarian, strong and intelligent but not particularly warm. His father barely appears in his memories beyond being described as "a man of great conscience." The maternal uncle with whom he lived during his school years in Travancore ruled with a rod of iron, frequently caning the boys, sometimes for no apparent reason. Yet this same uncle's house was open to journalists, politicians, writers, and poets, providing young Panikkar's first exposure to nationalist discourse.

This combination of strict discipline and intellectual ferment shaped Panikkar profoundly. He grew up in an environment where corporal punishment was normal—so normal that he later defended it in his memoir, a troubling detail that reveals how deeply internalized these experiences were. Yet he also grew up surrounded by books, ideas, and passionate discussions about India's future. His uncle's library became his refuge, and reading became his primary means of understanding the world.

The young Panikkar was not a good student in the conventional sense. He struggled with subjects that didn't interest him, particularly mathematics. His family despaired of him, comparing him unfavorably to his more academically successful brother. This sense of not being good enough, of disappointing family expectations, created a wound that drove much of his later ambition. He knew he was considered the family failure, and he was determined to prove everyone wrong.

There was even a suicide attempt—he somehow obtained chloroform and tried to end his life. He woke to find his grandmother crying over him, a moment of such emotional intensity that it stayed with him forever. This incident reveals the depth of his despair as a young person who felt inadequate and unloved, who couldn't meet the expectations placed upon him.

The move to Travancore for schooling exposed him to a world in ferment. This was the early 20th century, and India was experiencing profound social and political change. The Swadeshi movement had united the country in fury against the partition of Bengal. The Congress was splitting between moderates and extremists. Nationalist sentiment was rising. In his uncle's house, Panikkar heard all of this discussed passionately by people who were actively involved in these movements.

This early exposure to nationalism was crucial but limited. He heard about these issues, but he didn't yet understand them deeply. That understanding would come later, at Oxford, when peers challenged him to think more rigorously about what Indian independence actually meant. But the foundation was laid in Travancore, where he learned that politics mattered, that ideas had consequences, that India's future was something worth fighting for.

The family's progressive attitudes toward education were also significant. Despite being from a traditional Kerala Brahmin background, they believed in modern education and sent both boys to English-medium schools. They valued learning, even if they were disappointed in Panikkar's academic performance. This commitment to education, combined with the family's relative prosperity, gave Panikkar opportunities that most Indians of his generation lacked.

His relationship with his grandmother remained the emotional anchor of his childhood. She was the one who showed him unconditional love, who encouraged his love of reading and writing, who protected him from the harshest consequences of his rebelliousness. When he wrote love poems that got him in trouble, she was his secret ally. This relationship taught him that love could be gentle and supportive, not just demanding and disciplinary.

The contrast between his public family—strict, demanding, disappointed in him—and his private relationship with his grandmother created a split that would characterize his adult life. Publicly, he would be ambitious, driven, constantly proving himself. Privately, he would be tender, romantic, vulnerable, expressing these feelings primarily in his Malayalam writing where his public persona couldn't reach.

## 7. Oxford and the Awakening of Political Consciousness

***"He meets a group of young men who bring it home to him that he may have been exposed to nationalism in a limited sense at home, but he really didn't know the bigger issues of the day and he didn't know enough. And again, you see that flicker of self-doubt and low self-worth coming in."***

Panikkar arrived at Oxford in 1914, just as the world was on the cusp of war. England was experiencing immense unrest—labor strikes, class conflict, unemployment, the suffragette movement raging, debates over Home Rule for Ireland dominating Parliament, concepts of universal adult franchise being discussed. War clouds were gathering on the horizon. He walked into this maelstrom as a young man from Kerala who thought he understood nationalism but was about to discover how little he actually knew.

At Oxford, he encountered peers who were far more sophisticated in their political thinking. These young men—from Burma, Ceylon, India, and other colonies—were actively debating their countries' aspirations for independence, analyzing the structures of empire, thinking through what self-governance would actually mean. Panikkar realized with dismay that he was intellectually unprepared for these conversations. He had opinions but not arguments, feelings but not frameworks.

This realization could have been crushing, but instead it became catalytic. He went to his brother and asked what he should do. His brother's response was simple: "You can and you should" read more, learn more, think more deeply. This began a pattern that would define Panikkar's adult life—when confronted with his own ignorance or inadequacy, he would respond by reading voraciously, by educating himself, by refusing to remain ignorant.

He joined the Oxford Majlis, a debating club where students from across the British Empire discussed their countries' futures. Here he learned to articulate his ideas, to defend them against criticism, to refine them through argument. The experience was transformative. He discovered he had a gift for rhetoric, for marshaling facts and ideas into compelling arguments. The shy boy who couldn't speak in school competitions was becoming an effective public speaker.

The outbreak of World War I in 1914 intensified everything. India was at war, Indian soldiers were dying for the empire, and the question of what India would receive in return became urgent. Panikkar began writing seriously during this period—essays on citizenship, diaspora rights, immigration, identity, what India's place would be after the war. These were not simple topics, and his early writings were raw and angry, but they showed a mind grappling with fundamental questions.

His thinking about citizenship versus subjecthood became particularly important. What did it mean to be a subject of the empire versus a citizen of your own country? The distinction wasn't just legal; it was existential. Subjects had obligations but limited rights. Citizens had both rights and responsibilities. The transformation from subject to citizen would require not just political independence but a complete reimagining of the relationship between individual and state.

He also began thinking about what "Indian" meant. This was 1915-1916, before the term had clear constitutional meaning. India as a unified nation was still an aspiration, not a reality. The subcontinent contained hundreds of princely states, multiple religious communities, dozens of languages, vast cultural diversity. What would bind all this together? What would make someone "Indian" rather than Bengali or Malayali or Punjabi?

His answer, developing over these years, centered on civilizational continuity. India had existed as a cultural and spiritual entity for millennia, even if it hadn't been politically unified. Hinduism (understood broadly and inclusively) provided a common thread, not as a religion in the narrow sense but as a civilizational ethos. This was the beginning of his "Greater India" thinking, which would become both influential and problematic.

The war years at Oxford also exposed him to different models of nationalism. He studied Irish Home Rule debates, watched the suffragettes fight for women's rights, observed labor movements demanding economic justice. He learned that nationalism could take many forms—cultural, political, economic—and that these different forms could complement or contradict each other.

His social life at Oxford was also significant. He developed a reputation as something of a ladies' man, which created envy among some male peers. This early comfort with women, unusual for someone from his background, would characterize his adult life. He was attracted to strong, intelligent women and formed genuine friendships with them, not just romantic entanglements.

When he returned to India after the war, he was a different person from the uncertain boy who had left. He had intellectual confidence, political sophistication, and a clear sense that he wanted to contribute to India's independence movement. He didn't yet know how—that would take more years to figure out—but the direction was set.

## 8. The Journalist and the Founding of Hindustan Times

***"He begins running the Hindustan Times as this vehicle for nationalism. His greatest coup is he gets Gandhi to come in and inaugurate it. Gandhi tells them that the basis should be that you don't suppress facts and you don't publish false truths."***

Panikkar's entry into journalism was driven by a calculation: it seemed like a stepping stone to active politics. Many nationalist leaders had journalism backgrounds, and newspapers were seen as vehicles for political mobilization. In the 1920s, joining journalism was considered an act of patriotism—you were using your pen to fight for India's freedom.

His first stint was with Saraja, a crowdfunded magazine in Madras. It was poorly paid and precarious, but it gave him a platform. However, he quickly ran into conflict with the founder, Prakasam. Panikkar wanted to take on the state administration, expose corruption, challenge the governor. Prakasam wanted something more moderate. The clash was inevitable, and Panikkar was let go. It was a bitter disappointment—his plan to use journalism as a path to politics had failed.

The second chance came with the founding of Hindustan Times in 1924. The Akali Dal wanted a newspaper to represent their interests, and Panikkar convinced them it should be based in Delhi, not Punjab. He was made founding editor at just 30 years old, an extraordinary responsibility. He found premises on Barakhamba Road, brought in two presses, set up a single room for editorial staff, and began building a newspaper from scratch.

His coup was getting Gandhi to inaugurate the paper. Gandhi was reluctant—communal riots were raging across North India, and he had no desire to attend a newspaper launch. But Panikkar persisted, and Gandhi came. His message was simple but profound: don't suppress facts, don't publish false truths. This became Panikkar's guiding principle, at least initially.

The early Hindustan Times reflected Panikkar's vision of what nationalist journalism should be. It ran editorials arguing for Hindu-Muslim unity in the face of communalism. It pushed the Congress to include princely states in its manifesto. It exposed corruption in state governments and criticized administrative failures. But it also understood what readers wanted—there were gossip columns, society news, entertainment coverage. Panikkar knew that a newspaper had to be readable, not just righteous.

However, the venture was financially precarious from the start. Newspapers require constant investment, and the Akali Dal was not a wealthy organization. Losses mounted. Tensions grew between Panikkar's editorial vision and the management's concerns about money and political positioning. There was talk of shifting to a more right-wing agenda to attract different advertisers and readers. Panikkar wanted nothing to do with that.

The experience taught him several crucial lessons. First, journalism within institutional constraints requires compromises he wasn't willing to make. You can't just write what you believe; you have to consider owners, advertisers, political allies, financial realities. Second, newspapers are businesses, not just platforms for ideas. The economics matter as much as the editorial vision. Third, propaganda can be a powerful tool, but it cuts both ways—it can mobilize support or manipulate opinion.

After leaving Hindustan Times, Panikkar never again worked as a full-time journalist. But he continued writing prolifically for journals and newspapers, both in India and internationally. The difference was that he now wrote as an independent intellectual, not as someone constrained by institutional loyalties. He could say what he believed without worrying about how it affected a newspaper's bottom line or political relationships.

His international journalism became particularly important. Writing for foreign publications, he explained India's nationalist movement to global audiences, countered British propaganda, built support for independence. This was the kind of journalism he had always wanted to do—using his pen to advance the cause of Indian freedom, but on his own terms.

The Hindustan Times experience also taught him about the power of media to shape public discourse. He saw how newspapers could set agendas, frame debates, make certain issues visible while obscuring others. This understanding would serve him well in his later roles as a diplomat and advisor, where managing public perception was often as important as the substance of policy.

## 9. The Princely States and the Federation Debate

***"He was very disillusioned at the end of the first round table because they were tanking purely on the basis of communal issues. And this is despite the fact that the huge ambiguity of the round table agenda itself was staggering."***

Panikkar's involvement with the princely states began in the late 1920s and dominated the next two decades of his career. It was a period of immense complexity, frustration, and ultimately failure, but it shaped his understanding of Indian politics and governance in profound ways.

The context was crucial. After World War I, the princely states—which had contributed men and material to the war effort—wanted recognition and constitutional safeguards. The British, recognizing that India was strategically too valuable to lose, needed to manage these demands while maintaining control. The Chamber of Princes was created in 1920 as a consultative body, but it had no real power.

Panikkar entered this world through his writing. He had been analyzing the princely states since 1919, and his thinking evolved significantly. Initially, he was dismissive, writing sneering pieces about rulers who were "zanana-ridden and prone to backstairs intrigues." But as he studied them more deeply, he recognized that they represented important experiments in local self-governance and that they had to be integrated into any future Indian nation.

His breakthrough came when he wrote a tract arguing for federation—bringing princely states and British Indian provinces together in a federal structure. This wasn't a new idea, but Panikkar articulated it clearly and got it to the right person: Kay Huxar, who was representing the Maharaja of Kashmir. This led to Panikkar being hired to work for Kashmir, and eventually to becoming Secretary of the Chamber of Princes.

The 1930s were dominated by three Round Table Conferences in London, where the future constitutional structure of India was debated. Panikkar was deeply involved in preparing the princes' case for federation. But the conferences were nightmares of complexity. The princes themselves were divided—some wanted federation, others wanted to maintain complete autonomy. Personal rivalries and massive egos complicated everything. The Nizam of Hyderabad simply refused to participate, insisting he would do things his own way.

The communal question—how to protect Muslim, Sikh, and other minority interests—repeatedly derailed discussions. The British used these divisions skillfully, playing different groups against each other. The ambiguity of the Round Table agenda itself was staggering—different parties came with completely different expectations and goals.

Panikkar had to navigate all of this as a diplomat and advisor. He dealt with rulers who were brilliant on constitutional matters but also deeply flawed personally. The Maharaja of Alwar, for instance, was "a charmer and a pedophile and a man capable of setting his polo pony on fire when it didn't perform as he wanted it to. But he was also acutely aware of his constitutional rights based on the Government of India Act 1919." This combination of sophistication and depravity was not uncommon.

The Government of India Act of 1935 represented the high-water mark of the federation movement. It provided a framework for bringing the states into a federal structure. But the princes, by this point, were paralyzed by fears and suspicions. What would the Instrument of Accession mean for their paramountcy? What would happen to their treaties with the Crown? What about their boundaries, their privileges, their autonomy?

Panikkar knew by the late 1930s that federation was doomed. The princes were too divided, too fearful, too caught up in their own interests to act collectively. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended any remaining hope. The Viceroy, Linlithgow, sent India to war without consultation. Congress ministries resigned in protest. The political landscape shifted completely.

By the 1940s, Panikkar's thinking had evolved significantly. He was now firmly convinced that popular democratic politics was the future. The princes had missed their chance. They would have to accept integration into independent India on whatever terms they could get. His writing from this period reflects bitter disillusionment but also clear-eyed realism about what was coming.

The rise of popular movements within the princely states—demanding representative government, civil rights, economic reforms—made it clear that the old order was finished. Panikkar, who had spent two decades working for the princes, now recognized that their time was over. The question was no longer whether they would be integrated but how, and on what terms.

When independence came in 1947, the actual integration was handled by Sardar Patel and VP Menon. Panikkar's role was over. But his two decades of work had laid important groundwork. He had articulated the case for why the states mattered, had built relationships with key rulers, had developed frameworks for thinking about integration. The final solution—accession to India with limited autonomy—was not what he had originally envisioned, but it drew on ideas he had helped develop.

The experience left him with complex feelings. He had devoted enormous energy to a cause that ultimately failed. He had worked for rulers who were often difficult, sometimes despicable. He had compromised his own nationalist principles to serve princely interests. Yet he had also contributed to the eventual integration of 565 states into modern India, one of the great administrative achievements of the 20th century.

## 10. The Greater India Concept and Hindu Nationalism

***"For Panikkar, he was also operating between 1915 to 1947. There were so many factors to contend with which we sometimes tend to lose sight of. There was untouchability involved. There was caste involved. There was communalism involved heavily. In constitutional terms alone there was dominion status, there was federation."***

Panikkar's concept of "Greater India" was one of his most influential and controversial contributions to Indian nationalist thought. It emerged from his Oxford years and evolved throughout his life, serving multiple purposes—some admirable, some problematic.

The core idea was that Indian civilization had extended far beyond the subcontinent for millennia before British colonialism. Hindu and Buddhist cultural, spiritual, and commercial influence had shaped Southeast Asia—from Burma to Indonesia, from Cambodia to Vietnam. This wasn't military conquest but civilizational spread through trade, religion, scholarship, and cultural exchange.

In the 1920s and 1930s, this concept served an important anti-colonial purpose. It allowed nationalists like Panikkar to argue: "We were here before you. We had a civilization, a culture, a sphere of influence that extended across Asia. You didn't civilize us—we were already civilized." This was a powerful counter-narrative to British claims that colonialism had brought progress and enlightenment to backward peoples.

The Greater India school of thought was also trans-imperial and Asia-centric. It positioned India within a regional context, emphasizing connections with other Asian societies rather than defining India solely in relation to Europe. This was intellectually liberating and politically useful, especially as Asian nationalism grew in the 1920s and 1930s.

However, the concept had a darker potential. It could be repurposed in a more muscular, militant sense—as a vision of Hindu cultural dominance extending across Asia, a kind of civilizational imperialism. This version aligned with the Hindutva ideology being developed by figures like Savarkar, who envisioned a Hindu Rashtra with clear boundaries of who belonged and who didn't.

Panikkar's version differed from Savarkar's in crucial ways. He emphasized Hinduism's "generous vagueness"—its inclusiveness, its ability to absorb and accommodate different beliefs and practices. He insisted that India was a land of many religions, cultures, and languages, and that this diversity was a strength, not a weakness. His nationalism was never sectarian or based on majoritarianism.

But as he aged, particularly after independence and partition, his thinking became harder and more problematic. He began emphasizing more strongly that Hinduism was the beating heart of Indian civilization. He started using phrases like "Further India" instead of "Greater India," but the underlying concept remained similar. In a postcolonial world, this language risked erasing marginalized communities and imposing a Hindu-centric vision of national identity.

The tension in Panikkar's thought reflects a broader problem in Indian nationalism. How do you assert a strong national identity without excluding minorities? How do you celebrate Hindu civilization without implying Hindu supremacy? How do you build unity in a diverse society without imposing uniformity?

Nehru saw these dangers clearly. He disagreed strongly with Panikkar's emphasis on Hinduism as the foundation of Indian identity. He envisioned a secular, pluralistic India where religious identity was private, not the basis of citizenship. When international journalists questioned him about Panikkar's views, Nehru defended his right to express them—"in this country we allow freedom of speech and expression"—while making clear he didn't agree.

This disagreement between Nehru and Panikkar on fundamental questions of national identity is revealing. Nehru represented one vision of India—secular, socialist, looking forward. Panikkar represented another—rooted in civilizational continuity, emphasizing Hindu culture, looking backward to reclaim a glorious past. Both were nationalists, both wanted a strong independent India, but they had fundamentally different ideas about what that India should be.

The Greater India concept also reveals how intellectual frameworks developed in one context can become problematic in another. In the 1920s, arguing for India's civilizational greatness was anti-colonial resistance. In the 1950s, after independence and partition, the same arguments could sound like Hindu chauvinism. Context matters enormously in evaluating political ideas.

Panikkar himself seemed aware of some of these tensions. He modified his language over time, dropping "Greater India" for "Further India." He continued to insist on India's diversity and the importance of including all communities. But he never fully resolved the contradiction between celebrating Hindu civilization and building an inclusive, secular nation.

The debate continues today, of course. The question of what India is—a Hindu nation, a secular republic, a civilization-state—remains contested. Panikkar's work on Greater India is part of this ongoing conversation, offering both insights and warnings about the dangers of civilizational nationalism.

## 11. Writing as Hustle and Intellectual Development

***"His writing I think honestly in 2025 terms his writing was the greatest hustle that he was doing because it opened doors for him like nothing else ever could honestly."***

Panikkar's prolific writing career was simultaneously an intellectual project, a political intervention, and a professional strategy. He understood instinctively that in the early 20th century, writing was the primary means of establishing yourself as a serious thinker and gaining access to power.

From his Oxford years onward, he wrote constantly—essays, articles, books, pamphlets, reviews. The subjects ranged widely: Indian history, nationalism, foreign policy, the princely states, maritime strategy, constitutional law, literature. The venues were equally diverse: Indian journals, British publications, American magazines, academic presses, popular newspapers.

This writing served multiple functions. First, it was how he thought through complex issues. Writing forced him to clarify his ideas, to marshal evidence, to anticipate counterarguments. His thinking about Indian identity, for instance, evolved over decades of writing about it. Each essay or book represented a stage in an ongoing intellectual journey.

Second, writing established his reputation. When he met Gandhi and Nehru in Amritsar in 1924, they already knew his work. Nehru had read his early writings on nationalism and was impressed enough to offer him the job of writing a history of the non-cooperation movement. When he met Kay Huxar with his tract on federation, Huxar recognized him as a serious thinker worth hiring. When he was sent to China as ambassador in 1948, it was largely on the strength of his foreign policy writings.

Third, writing was how he influenced policy debates. His essays on maritime policy in the 1940s helped shape thinking about India's naval strategy. His work on the princely states influenced how nationalist leaders thought about integration. His dispatches from China (however problematic) shaped Nehru's understanding of the communist regime. His contributions to the States Reorganization Commission affected how India was restructured along linguistic lines.

Fourth, writing was income. Not always adequate income, but something. His books earned advances and royalties. His journalism paid fees. His scholarly work brought academic appointments. In a career that zigzagged between different roles—professor, journalist, administrator, diplomat—writing was the constant that provided both income and identity.

The intentionality of his writing career is striking. He didn't just write when inspired; he wrote strategically. When there was an essay competition with a 100-rupee prize, he entered it, producing his influential work on Greater India. When PB Krishna Warrior asked him to contribute to a Malayalam journal, he wrote an essay on Malayalam poetry that helped reshape the language's literary landscape. When he wanted to influence foreign opinion about India, he wrote for Foreign Affairs and other international publications.

He also understood the importance of writing for different audiences. His scholarly books on Indian history were dense and detailed, aimed at academics and serious students. His journalism was more accessible, aimed at educated general readers. His Malayalam fiction and poetry were intimate and personal, aimed at a regional audience that knew him differently than his English readers did.

The sheer volume of his output is staggering. Over his lifetime, he published dozens of books and hundreds of articles. He wrote in multiple languages—primarily English and Malayalam, but he also translated Greek plays and Shakespeare. He wrote in multiple genres—history, political analysis, fiction, poetry, memoir. He wrote for multiple purposes—scholarship, propaganda, income, personal expression.

This productivity was possible because writing was central to his identity. He wasn't someone who wrote occasionally when he had something to say. He was a writer who happened to also be a diplomat, administrator, and political advisor. Writing was how he made sense of the world, how he influenced it, how he earned his living, how he expressed his deepest feelings.

The contrast between his English and Malayalam writing is particularly revealing. In English, he was the public intellectual—analytical, argumentative, concerned with large historical and political questions. In Malayalam, he was the poet and novelist—emotional, romantic, nostalgic, concerned with personal experience and cultural identity. These weren't separate selves but different facets of the same complex personality, each finding expression in the appropriate language and genre.

His writing also reveals the evolution of his thinking. Early works are raw and angry, full of youthful certainty. Middle-period works are more sophisticated, showing deeper understanding of complexity and ambiguity. Late works are sometimes harder and more dogmatic, reflecting the disappointments and disillusionments of age. Tracing this evolution through his published work provides a map of his intellectual and emotional journey.

The lesson for contemporary writers and intellectuals is clear: writing is not just about expressing ideas; it's about building a career, establishing credibility, influencing debates, creating opportunities. Panikkar understood this instinctively and used writing strategically throughout his life. His success—despite lacking a PhD, despite coming from a relatively obscure background, despite numerous setbacks—was largely due to his ability to write prolifically and effectively.

## 12. The China Ambassadorship and Its Controversies

***"Where he starts to falter is in communist China where you see him visibly and slightly hilariously swept away by his impressions of communist leaders like he dispatches to Nehru that Chou En-lai has fingers which resemble tender green onion shoots and Mao is the new Moses that will lead his people to the promised land."***

Panikkar's ambassadorship to China (1948-1952) was the most controversial period of his career, and it continues to shape his historical reputation. The assignment came at a crucial moment—China was in the final stages of civil war, the Communist Party was about to take power, and India needed someone who could navigate this transition and establish relations with the new regime.

Nehru chose Panikkar for several reasons. He was an established foreign policy thinker who had written extensively about Asia. He shared Nehru's vision of Asian solidarity—the idea that India and China, as ancient civilizations, should lead a resurgent Asia. He was intellectually sophisticated and politically reliable. And crucially, in 1948, India didn't have a trained diplomatic service, so Nehru had to send people he personally trusted.

Panikkar's first stint in China, during the dying days of the Nationalist regime, was actually quite prescient. He recognized that the Communists would win the civil war and that they would pursue territorial consolidation, including in Tibet. He warned Nehru that when the Communists came to power, they would actively consolidate territories they felt historically belonged to China. This was accurate analysis.

The problems began after the Communist takeover in 1949. Panikkar became visibly enchanted by the Communist leaders and their revolution. His dispatches to New Delhi were filled with admiring descriptions—Chou En-lai's fingers like "tender green onion shoots," Mao as "the new Moses" leading his people to the promised land. This language was not just flowery; it suggested he was losing analytical distance.

More seriously, he consistently downplayed Chinese intentions regarding Tibet and India's borders. When China invaded Tibet in 1950, Panikkar reported that Chinese assurances about respecting Tibetan autonomy should be taken at face value. When the Korean War broke out and China intervened, Panikkar's warnings that China would enter the war were accurate, but his broader analysis of Chinese motivations was overly sympathetic.

The most damaging omission was his failure to press for border negotiations with Chou En-lai when there was an opportunity for settlement. He assumed that because India's maps showed certain borders, and because Nehru had mentioned these borders in Parliament, the Chinese must know and accept them. This was a catastrophic failure of diplomatic responsibility. Ambassadors cannot assume anything; they must negotiate explicitly.

Colleagues in the Ministry of External Affairs—particularly Girija Shankar Bajpai and KPS Menon—repeatedly warned that Panikkar's reporting should be taken "with a kilo of salt." Sardar Patel warned about Chinese intentions. But Nehru continued to rely heavily on Panikkar's assessments, often bypassing his own ministry's advice. This was partly because Panikkar was telling Nehru what he wanted to hear—that Asian solidarity was possible, that China could be trusted, that India's approach was working.

The question of blame is complex. Panikkar made serious errors of judgment. He was too sympathetic to the Chinese Communist regime, too willing to accept their assurances, too negligent about border issues. But Nehru also bears responsibility. He chose to listen to Panikkar over other advisors. He failed to develop a coherent Tibet policy, leaving Panikkar to improvise. He allowed his vision of Asian solidarity to cloud his judgment about Chinese intentions.

The broader context also matters. This was the early Cold War period. The United States was pressuring India to take a harder line against Communist China. Nehru was trying to maintain non-alignment and build Asian solidarity. India's own security situation was precarious—partition had just occurred, Kashmir was contested, resources were limited. In this context, trying to maintain good relations with China made strategic sense, even if the execution was flawed.

What's remarkable is that despite the controversy over China, Nehru continued to value Panikkar's service. He sent him as ambassador to Egypt (1952-1955), where Panikkar played a crucial role during the Suez Crisis and in building the Non-Aligned Movement. He brought him back to serve on the States Reorganization Commission. He continued to seek his advice on various matters, even when he disagreed with him.

This speaks to something important about political discourse in that era. Despite profound disagreements—on China, on language policy, on Hindu nationalism—Nehru and Panikkar maintained mutual respect. Nehru defended Panikkar's right to express controversial opinions, even when those opinions embarrassed the government. Panikkar, for his part, continued to serve loyally even when his advice was rejected.

The China episode also reveals the dangers of letting ideology override analysis. Panikkar's commitment to Asian solidarity, his belief in the possibility of India-China friendship, his sympathy for anti-colonial movements—all of these were admirable in principle. But they led him to misread Chinese intentions and to downplay warning signs that should have been obvious.

The long-term consequences were severe. The border issues that Panikkar failed to address in 1950-1952 contributed to the 1962 war, which was a humiliating defeat for India and a personal tragedy for Nehru. While it's too simple to blame Panikkar for the war—many factors contributed—his failures as ambassador were part of the chain of events that led to it.

## 13. The Personal Life and Secret Self

***"His writing in Malayalam was something that he was very passionate about. That was where he really unleashed the tender sides of his personality, the softer sides, the more romantic sides, the sides that you wouldn't associate with the forensic mind of an administrator or a diplomat or a foreign policy mandarin."***

Behind the public figure—the diplomat, the administrator, the foreign policy expert—was a private Panikkar who expressed himself primarily through Malayalam literature. This was his secret self, the part of him that remained hidden from his English-reading audience and from the political world in which he operated.

His Malayalam writing included poetry, novels, and translations. He published a critically acclaimed translation of King Lear, wrote a play based on Nur Jahan, and created a poem recreating an episode from Gandhari's life in the Mahabharata. These weren't minor efforts or hobbies; they were serious literary works that contributed to Malayalam literature's development.

The essay he wrote on Malayalam poetry in Sanskrit verses, arguing for the Dravidian meter instead of Sanskrit, was hugely influential. It led to a discussion with the poet Vallathol, who tested Panikkar's thesis by writing in Dravidian meter, producing something significant in the language's evolution. This shows how even his literary criticism had practical impact.

His Malayalam writing was characterized by tenderness, nostalgia, and romanticism. He wrote about Kerala with deep love—the landscape, the culture, the people. His descriptions of his childhood home, of the journey from Kuttanad to Travancore, were vivid and affectionate. This was a side of him that rarely appeared in his English writing, which was typically analytical and argumentative.

His personal life was also more complex than his public persona suggested. His marriage to Gori was arranged, and she was initially a very traditional, shy woman who spoke only Malayalam and had never left Kuttanad. When he transplanted her to Aligarh for his teaching position, she was completely out of her depth.

But during his two-year absence in Europe in the mid-1920s, Gori transformed herself. She learned multiple languages, developed a dry sense of humor, became confident and capable. When Panikkar returned, he found not the shy girl he had married but a strong, intelligent woman who could match him intellectually. This reinvention was remarkable, and it speaks to her own strength and determination.

Their marriage became a genuine partnership. She managed their household with great skill, creating a home wherever they went—whether in Kashmir, Patiala, Bikaner, China, Egypt, or France. Her routine was always the same: first set up the kitchen, then the garden. This might seem traditional, but it was also how she created stability and comfort in constantly changing circumstances.

Panikkar's relationships with his daughters were also revealing. He treated them as intellectual equals, encouraged their education and independence, and supported their choices even when they were unconventional. When his daughter Dwaki fell in love with MN Nair, a rising communist leader, Panikkar was serving as ambassador to China and was already accused of being pro-communist. Supporting his daughter's relationship with a communist could have been politically damaging, but he never hesitated.

His friendships with strong women were important throughout his life. Sarojini Naidu was a close friend and intellectual companion. He was drawn to women who were intelligent, articulate, and independent—the opposite of the traditional submissive ideal. This preference was evident from his Oxford days, when he was known as something of a ladies' man, through his diplomatic career, when he formed important friendships with women in various countries.

There's a paradox here. In his memoir, written in 1955, he expressed fairly conventional views about women's roles—they should be educated but not at the cost of domestic duties. Yet his actual relationships with women—his wife, his daughters, his friends—showed deep respect for their intelligence and autonomy. The memoir's chauvinism seems to reflect the expected attitudes of his generation more than his actual beliefs and behavior.

His later years were marked by increasing awareness of mortality. After his stroke in France, he knew his health was failing. His writing from this period has a wistful, elegiac quality. He wrote more about death, more about endings, more about what his life had meant. There was a sense of summing up, of trying to make sense of a life that had been extraordinarily full but also marked by disappointments and failures.

His death in 1963 was sudden but somehow fitting. He was attending a lecture by a poet at Mysore University, where he was vice-chancellor. He felt pain in his heart but said nothing, just left holding his chest. He collapsed in the car on the way home and was dead by the time they arrived. It was a quiet ending for someone who had lived such a public, tumultuous life.

The contrast between his public and private selves raises questions about how we understand historical figures. The public Panikkar—ambitious, driven, sometimes arrogant, always hustling—is only part of the story. The private Panikkar—tender, romantic, vulnerable, devoted to his family and his language—is equally real. Biography must capture both to give a complete picture.

## 14. The Relationship with Nehru

***"This was a prime minister who really really did respect Panikkar but was also thoroughly irritated with him. At some point he just refused outright sometimes to have Panikkar's opinion on certain things. He never did it to Panikkar's face. It would always be done writing to some under secretary or writing to his sister."***

The relationship between Nehru and Panikkar was one of the most important and complex in both men's lives. It combined deep mutual respect with profound disagreements, intellectual stimulation with political frustration, personal affection with professional exasperation.

They first met in 1924 in Amritsar, when Panikkar was serving as Gandhi's emissary during the Akali crisis. Nehru had already read Panikkar's early writings on nationalism and was impressed. He offered Panikkar the job of writing a history of the non-cooperation movement, which Panikkar declined—he wanted something bigger, which led to the founding of Hindustan Times.

Over the following decades, their paths crossed repeatedly. Panikkar's work on the princely states, his foreign policy writings, his journalism—all of this kept him in Nehru's orbit. Nehru valued Panikkar's intellect, his ability to think strategically about India's place in the world, his willingness to tackle complex problems.

When India became independent, Nehru needed people he could trust for crucial diplomatic positions. He sent Panikkar to China, despite Panikkar having no formal diplomatic training. This was both a mark of trust and a practical necessity—India didn't have a trained foreign service yet, so Nehru had to rely on people whose judgment he respected.

The China assignment tested their relationship severely. Panikkar's reporting was often overly optimistic about Chinese intentions. His failure to press for border negotiations was a serious error. His enchantment with Communist leaders raised questions about his judgment. Nehru received warnings from other advisors that Panikkar's assessments should be taken with skepticism, but he continued to rely on them, partly because they aligned with his own hopes for Asian solidarity.

Yet even after the China controversies, Nehru continued to value Panikkar's service. He sent him to Egypt, where Panikkar performed well during the Suez Crisis. He appointed him to the States Reorganization Commission, one of the most important bodies in post-independence India. He continued to seek his advice on various matters.

Their disagreements on fundamental issues became more pronounced over time. On language policy, Panikkar argued that Hindi should be the national language, while Nehru insisted that India was a country of many languages and none should have supremacy. On Hindu nationalism, Panikkar's emphasis on Hinduism as the beating heart of Indian civilization conflicted with Nehru's secular vision. On the States Reorganization Commission, Panikkar argued for linguistic reorganization despite Nehru's explicit request for unity.

These disagreements frustrated Nehru enormously. He would write to his sister or to undersecretaries expressing irritation with Panikkar, saying to leave him out of certain discussions. But he never confronted Panikkar directly, never publicly criticized him, never cut him off completely. When international journalists questioned Nehru about Panikkar's controversial statements, Nehru defended his right to express them: "In this country we allow freedom of speech and expression. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion even though I may not agree with it."

This civility despite profound disagreement is remarkable, especially by contemporary standards. Today, such disagreements would likely lead to public feuds, Twitter wars, complete ruptures. But Nehru and Panikkar maintained mutual respect even when they disagreed fundamentally about India's future.

Part of this was generational. They were both products of a political culture that valued intellectual debate and tolerated dissent. Part of it was personal—they genuinely liked each other despite their differences. Part of it was practical—they needed each other. Nehru needed Panikkar's expertise and service; Panikkar needed Nehru's patronage and platforms.

The relationship also reveals something about Nehru's leadership style. He surrounded himself with strong personalities who weren't afraid to disagree with him. He valued intellectual stimulation over sycophancy. He was willing to be frustrated and irritated by advisors if they brought valuable perspectives. This made for messy, contentious governance, but it also prevented the echo chamber effect that plagues many leaders.

When Panikkar died in 1963, Nehru felt genuine grief. This was the loss of someone who had stimulated him, challenged him, served him, and irritated him for nearly four decades. Their relationship had been complicated, sometimes difficult, but ultimately productive. They had both contributed to building independent India, even when they disagreed about what that India should be.

The Nehru-Panikkar relationship offers lessons for contemporary politics. It shows that it's possible to disagree profoundly on fundamental issues while maintaining respect and civility. It demonstrates that leaders benefit from advisors who challenge them rather than simply agreeing. It proves that intellectual diversity strengthens rather than weakens governance.

## 15. The Challenge of Being a Young Woman Historian

***"I think you know when you when I first came into this it was with a lot of hope that I would be taken seriously. I think by and large yes I have been taken seriously. Of course there are people who don't and I think that's the case with everyone but I feel like there were moments where I did feel that okay I'm not being taken seriously because this is my great-grandfather."***

Narani Basu's experience as a young woman entering the field of history in India reveals the multiple barriers that exist beyond the obvious challenges of archival research and writing. Gender, age, credentials, and subject matter all intersected to create obstacles that male historians with traditional qualifications rarely face.

The first challenge was credibility. When she published her book on VP Menon, some people dismissed it as "family history"—the great-granddaughter writing about her great-grandfather. Never mind that she didn't know he was her great-grandfather when she started the research, or that the book was based on extensive archival work and original sources. The family connection became a reason to question her seriousness as a historian.

This is a gendered phenomenon. Male historians writing about family members are often praised for having special insight or access. Women historians doing the same are suspected of being sentimental or biased. The assumption is that women write from emotion while men write from reason, even when the actual work demonstrates equal rigor.

The second challenge was the ecosystem itself. Indian historical scholarship is dominated by a small, incestuous group of people with credentials from a handful of institutions. They have built their reputations, established their networks, and control access to resources and platforms. Breaking into this world as an outsider—without a PhD, without institutional affiliation, without the right connections—is extremely difficult.

Basu describes the ecosystem as "full of midwits"—people with impressive credentials who produce mediocre work but are taken seriously because of their institutional positions. This is frustrating for anyone trying to do serious work outside traditional structures, but it's particularly difficult for women, who face additional skepticism about their capabilities.

The third challenge was the economics. Historical research and writing don't pay well, which means you need either family support or other income sources to sustain yourself. Basu spent five years barely surviving on research assistant wages, sometimes choosing between metro fare and food. This kind of precarity is harder for women to navigate, both because of safety concerns (working late, traveling alone) and because of social expectations (family pressure to get a "real job" or get married).

The fourth challenge was confidence and self-doubt. Even after publishing a successful book, Basu felt she needed to prove herself with her next project. She chose Panikkar partly because she wanted to demonstrate that she could write about someone unrelated to her family, that she was a "real" historian. This need to constantly prove yourself is exhausting and is experienced more intensely by women, who face greater skepticism about their abilities.

The fifth challenge was navigating professional spaces. Academic conferences, archive reading rooms, editorial meetings—these are often male-dominated spaces where women can feel unwelcome or invisible. Basu mentions being at events where nobody showed up, being dismissed or ignored, facing subtle (and not-so-subtle) condescension.

However, she also emphasizes that she has been largely taken seriously, particularly by the people whose opinions she values. Established historians like Srinath Raghavan have supported her work. Publishers have been willing to take chances on her projects. Readers have responded enthusiastically to her books. The majority of her experience has been positive, even if there have been difficult moments.

Her strategy for dealing with these challenges has been to focus on the work itself. She doesn't engage with critics who dismiss her because of her gender or lack of credentials. She doesn't try to play the academic game of networking and credential-building. She simply does rigorous research, writes compelling books, and lets the work speak for itself.

This approach has worked, but it requires enormous confidence and resilience. It means accepting that some people will never take you seriously, no matter how good your work is. It means being comfortable with being an outsider, with not having the institutional validation that comes from a PhD or a university position. It means defining success on your own terms rather than by traditional academic metrics.

The broader lesson is that the barriers to entry in historical scholarship remain significant, particularly for women and for people without traditional credentials. The field needs more diversity—not just of gender but of background, perspective, and approach. The dominance of a small elite with similar training and similar views produces a narrow, limited understanding of history.

Basu's success despite these barriers is encouraging, but it shouldn't require such extraordinary effort and resilience. The field should be more open, more welcoming, more willing to judge work on its merits rather than on credentials or connections. Until that changes, many talented potential historians will be excluded, and our understanding of history will be poorer for it.

## 16. The Craft of Archival Research

***"The National Archives is this labyrinth where you basically have to figure out which index to look at, which subheading under those indexes to look at, which cross reference to look at. The file that comes up can either be NT which is not traceable or not transferred or it's just not there or it's been taken by monkeys which is a thing or it's a mess."***

Archival research is the foundation of serious historical work, but it's rarely taught systematically in Indian universities. Basu had to learn everything through trial and error, developing strategies for navigating the chaos of Indian archives and extracting useful information from fragmentary sources.

The National Archives in Delhi is the primary repository for government documents from the colonial and early independence periods. It's a vast collection, but accessing it requires understanding a complex system of indexes, subheadings, and cross-references. You can't just ask for "files about VP Menon" or "documents on the princely states." You have to know which ministry produced which files, which years to search, which subject headings might contain relevant material.

Even when you identify potentially useful files, there's no guarantee they'll be available. Files might be marked "NT"—not traceable or not transferred—meaning they're lost or were never deposited in the archives. They might have been damaged by water, insects, or monkeys (literally—monkeys sometimes get into storage areas and destroy documents). They might be empty—listed in the index but containing nothing. Or they might be restricted for security reasons, requiring special permission to access.

On any given day of archival research, you face twenty-five dead ends. You order files that don't exist, find files that are empty, discover that the file you need is restricted, realize that the file you thought would be useful contains nothing relevant. This is normal, but it's also deeply frustrating. It requires patience, persistence, and the ability to keep going despite constant disappointment.

When you do find useful files, the work is just beginning. Colonial-era documents are often handwritten in difficult-to-read script. They use abbreviations and jargon that require decoding. They assume knowledge of administrative structures and procedures that no longer exist. They're organized according to bureaucratic logic that doesn't match how historians think about topics.

You have to read through enormous amounts of material to find the few nuggets of useful information. A file might contain hundreds of pages of routine correspondence, with only a few pages that actually matter for your research. But you can't skip ahead—you have to read everything, because you don't know what might be important until you see it.

Note-taking is crucial but challenging. You can't photocopy everything (it's expensive and often not allowed). You have to decide what to copy, what to photograph, what to transcribe by hand, what to summarize. These decisions are difficult because you don't always know what will be important later. You might realize months later that you needed information from a file you didn't copy completely.

The breakthrough moments make it all worthwhile. Finding VP Menon's voice in the Harry Hodson recordings at SOAS was transformative for Basu's first book. Discovering Panikkar's correspondence with various political leaders revealed aspects of his thinking that weren't visible in his published work. These discoveries can't be predicted—they come from spending time in archives, following leads, being open to serendipity.

Oral history adds another dimension. Basu interviewed Panikkar's last surviving daughter and corresponded with his granddaughter. These conversations provided personal details and family stories that don't appear in official documents. They helped her understand Panikkar as a person, not just as a historical figure. But oral history also requires careful handling—memories are fallible, people have their own biases and agendas, family stories can be mythologized.

The challenge is synthesizing all this material—archival documents, published works, oral histories, secondary sources—into a coherent narrative. You have thousands of pieces of information, and you have to figure out which ones matter, how they fit together, what story they tell. This is where the craft of history becomes art.

Basu also had to learn when to stop researching. There's always more to find, always another archive to visit, always another lead to follow. But at some point, you have to say "enough" and start writing. This is difficult because you always feel you haven't found everything, haven't understood everything. But perfect knowledge is impossible—you have to work with what you have.

The physical and mental demands of archival research are significant. Hours in reading rooms with poor lighting and ventilation. Days of finding nothing useful. The constant low-level anxiety that you're missing something important. The loneliness of working alone on a project that nobody else fully understands. The financial stress of funding research trips and archive fees.

Yet there's also deep satisfaction in archival work. The detective work of following leads, the excitement of discovery, the sense of bringing forgotten stories to light. When you find a document that answers a question you've been puzzling over, or reveals something nobody knew before, it's genuinely thrilling. This is why historians do this work despite all the difficulties.

## 17. The Evolution of Indian Nationalism

***"His idea of India is something that is fascinating because you can see that evolving right from when he is a first year student in Oxford right to when he dies. It's something where you can see the stresses and pulls of the different times that he finds himself living through."***

Panikkar's thinking about Indian nationalism evolved continuously over five decades, reflecting both his personal intellectual journey and the changing circumstances of India itself. Tracing this evolution reveals how nationalism as an idea was contested, fluid, and responsive to historical events.

In his Oxford years (1914-1918), his nationalism was primarily cultural and civilizational. He argued that India had existed as a cultural entity for millennia, that Hindu civilization had spread across Asia, that Indians had a distinct identity separate from British colonialism. This was anti-colonial nationalism—asserting Indian greatness against British claims of bringing civilization to backward peoples.

The post-World War I period (1919-1924) saw his nationalism become more political. He began thinking seriously about what independence would mean in practical terms—what kind of government, what constitutional structure, how to integrate diverse regions and communities. His journalism during this period pushed for concrete political change, not just cultural assertion.

The 1920s and 1930s were dominated by his work on the princely states and federation. His nationalism during this period emphasized the need to bring the states into a unified India. He argued that the princes represented important experiments in local governance and that their integration was essential for a strong, unified nation. This was pragmatic nationalism—focused on the mechanics of building a nation-state.

The 1940s brought a shift toward foreign policy and geopolitical thinking. His nationalism became more outward-looking, concerned with India's place in Asia and the world. He wrote about maritime policy, defense strategy, regional alliances. He argued that India needed to think beyond independence to what kind of power it would be in a decolonizing world. This was strategic nationalism—focused on India's security and influence.

The post-independence period (1947-1963) saw his nationalism become more cultural and linguistic again, but in a different way. He argued for Hindi as the national language, for recognizing Hinduism's central role in Indian civilization, for maintaining cultural continuity with the past. This was conservative nationalism—focused on preserving what he saw as India's essential character against homogenizing modernization.

Throughout all these phases, certain themes remained constant. He always emphasized India's civilizational continuity, the importance of historical consciousness, the need for cultural confidence. He always believed that India had a special role to play in Asia and the world. He always insisted that nationalism should be inclusive, not sectarian.

But the specifics changed dramatically. His views on the princely states evolved from dismissive to supportive to realistic about their inevitable integration. His views on China shifted from hopeful about Asian solidarity to disappointed by Chinese actions. His views on language policy hardened from flexible to insistent on Hindi's primacy.

These changes weren't random or inconsistent. They reflected his responses to changing circumstances. When the princely states seemed like they might be left out of independent India, he argued for their inclusion. When China seemed like a potential partner, he emphasized Asian solidarity. When linguistic nationalism threatened national unity, he argued for a common language.

The tension in his nationalism was between unity and diversity. He wanted a strong, unified India, but he also valued India's cultural and linguistic diversity. He wanted to assert Hindu civilization's importance, but he insisted this should be inclusive, not exclusionary. He wanted a common national identity, but he recognized that India contained multiple identities.

This tension was never fully resolved, and it remains unresolved in Indian politics today. How do you build national unity while respecting diversity? How do you assert cultural identity without excluding minorities? How do you balance regional autonomy with central authority? These questions that Panikkar grappled with are still contested.

His evolution also reveals the dangers of ideological rigidity. When his commitment to Asian solidarity led him to downplay Chinese threats, the results were disastrous. When his emphasis on Hindu civilization became harder in his later years, it risked alienating minorities. Flexibility and responsiveness to changing circumstances are essential, but so is maintaining core principles.

The comparison with Nehru is instructive. Both were nationalists, both wanted a strong independent India, both thought deeply about what India should be. But they had fundamentally different visions. Nehru's nationalism was secular, socialist, modernizing, looking forward. Panikkar's was civilizational, culturally rooted, historically conscious, looking backward to reclaim a glorious past.

Neither vision was entirely right or wrong. India needed both the forward-looking modernization that Nehru championed and the cultural rootedness that Panikkar emphasized. The tension between these visions has been productive, generating ongoing debate about India's identity and future.

Panikkar's nationalism also shows how intellectuals contribute to nation-building. He didn't lead mass movements or hold high political office. But through his writing, his diplomatic service, his advisory roles, he shaped how Indians thought about their country. His ideas about Greater India, about the princely states, about foreign policy, about language—all of these influenced policy debates and public discourse.

The lesson is that nationalism is not a fixed ideology but an evolving conversation. It changes in response to circumstances, challenges, opportunities. It's shaped by intellectuals, politicians, activists, ordinary citizens. It's contested, fluid, sometimes contradictory. Understanding this complexity is essential for understanding both historical and contemporary nationalism.

## 18. The States Reorganization Commission

***"He actively tours the country along with the other members of the States Reorganization Commission and he realizes that in the interest of federal unity this is something that he will have to do and in fact he puts together a 10-page dissent note and calls for the bifurcation of Uttar Pradesh in the interest of federal unity."***

Panikkar's service on the States Reorganization Commission (1953-1955) was one of his most important contributions to independent India, and it revealed both his pragmatism and his willingness to change his mind based on evidence.

The context was crucial. After independence, India had inherited a chaotic administrative structure—former British provinces, integrated princely states, and various other territories, all with different boundaries that often made no sense. There was growing pressure to reorganize states along linguistic lines, with speakers of each major language having their own state.

Nehru was deeply opposed to this. He feared that linguistic reorganization would encourage regional nationalism at the expense of national unity. He worried that it would lead to demands for further subdivision, potentially fragmenting India. He wanted to maintain the existing structure, however illogical, to preserve unity.

Panikkar initially agreed with Nehru. He had spent decades working on bringing the princely states into India, and he didn't want to see that achievement undone by linguistic nationalism. He believed that encouraging regional identities would undermine the national identity that was still fragile in the aftermath of partition.

But when the Commission actually toured the country and heard from people, Panikkar changed his mind. He saw that linguistic identity was deeply felt, that people genuinely wanted states organized along linguistic lines, that denying this would create more problems than it solved. He concluded that linguistic reorganization was necessary for federal unity, not a threat to it.

This was a remarkable intellectual evolution. He was willing to change his position based on evidence, even though it meant disagreeing with Nehru and contradicting his own earlier views. This kind of flexibility is rare in politics, where admitting you were wrong is often seen as weakness.

His dissent note calling for the bifurcation of Uttar Pradesh was particularly bold. UP was (and is) India's largest state, politically crucial, and dividing it was politically explosive. The Chief Minister of UP was furious. Nehru was livid. But Panikkar argued that UP was too large to be governed effectively, that dividing it would improve administration and strengthen federal unity.

The Commission's final report recommended reorganizing states along linguistic lines, which was implemented in 1956. This was one of the most significant administrative reforms in independent India's history. It created the basic structure of Indian federalism that exists today, with states largely organized by language.

The success of this reorganization vindicated Panikkar's changed position. Linguistic states didn't fragment India; they strengthened it by giving people a sense of ownership over their state governments. Regional nationalism and national nationalism coexisted, sometimes in tension but not in fundamental conflict.

Panikkar's work on the Commission also showed his ability to work collaboratively. The Commission had three members with different backgrounds and perspectives, and they had to reach consensus on controversial issues. Panikkar's diplomatic skills, honed through years of working with difficult princely rulers, served him well in navigating these discussions.

The experience also revealed his commitment to federalism as a principle. He believed that India's diversity required a federal structure that gave states significant autonomy while maintaining national unity. This was consistent with his earlier work on the princely states, where he had argued for federation as the best way to integrate diverse territories.

However, his dissent on UP bifurcation was not accepted, and UP remained undivided until 2000, when Uttarakhand was carved out. This shows the limits of even influential advisors—they can make recommendations, but political leaders make final decisions based on multiple considerations.

The States Reorganization Commission work also demonstrated Panikkar's continued relevance in independent India. Despite the controversies over China, despite his disagreements with Nehru on various issues, he was still trusted with crucial responsibilities. His expertise, his judgment, his ability to think through complex problems—all of these remained valuable.

## 19. The Final Years and Legacy

***"There was a sense of an ending almost. And I think at that point is where he begins to just write without thinking about anything because I think he knows that his days are coming to an end."***

Panikkar's final years (1960-1963) were marked by declining health, increasing awareness of mortality, and a sense of summing up a life that had been extraordinarily full but also marked by disappointments.

After his stroke in France in 1959, he knew his health was failing. He returned to India and took up the position of Vice-Chancellor of Mysore University, but it was clear this would be his last major role. His writing from this period has a wistful, elegiac quality. He wrote more about death, more about endings, more about what his life had meant.

His memoir, written in 1955, had been an attempt to make sense of his journey. But even there, he was selective about what to include and how to present it. He downplayed his work in Bikaner, was circumspect about his time in China, emphasized certain aspects of his thinking while obscuring others. The memoir was as much about how he wanted to be remembered as about what actually happened.

In his final years, he became more dogmatic on certain issues. His insistence on Hindi as the national language, his harder line on Hindu civilization's centrality, his rejection of Sampurnanand's committee on emotional integration—all of these suggested a man who was less flexible than he had been earlier. This is common in aging—the willingness to change one's mind often decreases with age.

Yet he also remained intellectually active until the end. He continued writing, continued engaging with current issues, continued contributing to debates about India's future. His mind remained sharp even as his body failed. This intellectual vitality was one of his defining characteristics throughout his life.

His death in 1963 was sudden. He was attending a poetry lecture at Mysore University when he felt chest pain. He left quietly, holding his chest, and collapsed in the car on the way home. By the time they reached his house, he was dead. It was a quiet ending for someone who had lived such a public, tumultuous life.

The question of his legacy is complex. He made significant contributions to Indian nationalism, to the integration of princely states, to foreign policy thinking, to Malayalam literature. He was one of the most versatile intellectuals of his generation, contributing across multiple fields. His writing influenced how Indians thought about their country and its place in the world.

But he also made serious errors. His handling of the China ambassadorship contributed to problems that culminated in the 1962 war. His emphasis on Hindu civilization, while not as toxic as Hindutva ideology, still risked excluding minorities. His views on women, while more progressive than many of his contemporaries, were still limited by the patriarchy of his time.

He was, in short, a great man with significant limitations—which is true of most historical figures. The "great man theory" of history is problematic because it ignores these limitations and treats historical figures as heroes without flaws. A more nuanced view recognizes both achievements and failures, both insights and blind spots.

Panikkar's life also illustrates the importance of context in evaluating historical figures. Ideas and actions that made sense in one context can seem problematic in another. His Greater India concept was anti-colonial resistance in the 1920s but could sound like Hindu chauvinism in the 1950s. His optimism about China was reasonable in 1949 but looks naive in retrospect.

The relationship between his public and private selves remains fascinating. The ambitious, driven public intellectual who hustled his way into every important conversation about India's future coexisted with the tender, romantic poet who wrote lovingly about Kerala in Malayalam. These weren't separate people but different facets of the same complex personality.

His impact on Malayalam literature is often overlooked in discussions of his legacy, but it was significant. His essay on Malayalam poetry influenced the language's literary development. His translations brought world literature to Malayalam readers. His fiction and poetry contributed to the language's richness. This was work he did for love, not for career advancement, and it reveals a side of him that his English-language work doesn't show.

The lesson of Panikkar's life is that historical figures are always more complex than they appear. They contain multitudes, contradict themselves, evolve over time, succeed in some areas while failing in others. Good biography captures this complexity rather than simplifying it into a heroic or villainous narrative.

For contemporary India, Panikkar's life offers both inspiration and warning. His intellectual versatility, his willingness to reinvent himself, his commitment to public service—these are admirable. His errors of judgment, his occasional dogmatism, his blind spots about gender and minorities—these are cautionary. We can learn from both his successes and his failures.

## 20. The Biographer's Journey

***"I think at best what you can do as a biographer is try and understand what you have in front of you from the archives plus what they are saying plus what their families have left behind. Sort of to sift through all of that. I think somewhere in between the lines is where you find the real person."***

Writing biography is an act of interpretation, not just compilation. The biographer must sift through vast amounts of material—archival documents, published works, oral histories, secondary sources—and construct a narrative that makes sense of a life. This requires both rigorous research and creative synthesis.

Basu's approach to biography is grounded in storytelling. She wants to tell a story that engages readers while remaining faithful to historical evidence. This means making choices about structure, pacing, what to include and exclude, how to present complex information accessibly.

The challenge is that you can never fully know your subject. You have fragments—documents they wrote, things others said about them, actions they took—but you can't get inside their head. You can't know what they were really thinking or feeling at any given moment. You have to infer, interpret, imagine (within the bounds of evidence).

This is why Basu is skeptical of biographies that claim to be "comprehensive" or "definitive." No biography can be comprehensive because no biographer can know everything about their subject. There are always gaps, ambiguities, contradictions. The best you can do is present a plausible interpretation based on available evidence.

The relationship between biographer and subject is also complex. You spend years immersed in someone's life, reading their words, following their journey, trying to understand their choices. You develop a relationship with them, even though they're dead. Sometimes you admire them, sometimes you're frustrated with them, sometimes you're puzzled by them.

Basu experienced all of these feelings with both VP Menon and Panikkar. She admired their achievements but was troubled by their limitations. She was fascinated by their complexity but frustrated when they made poor choices. She wanted to present them fairly but also honestly, not hagiography but not hatchet jobs either.

The ethical questions in biography are significant. How much of someone's private life should be revealed? How do you handle information that might hurt living family members? How do you present flaws and failures without being sensationalistic? How do you avoid imposing your own values and judgments on people who lived in different times?

Basu's approach is to focus on what's relevant for understanding her subject's public life and historical significance. She includes personal details when they illuminate character or explain choices, but she's not interested in gossip for its own sake. She presents flaws and failures honestly but contextualizes them within their time.

The writing process itself is challenging. You have thousands of pages of notes, hundreds of sources, multiple narrative threads to weave together. You have to decide on structure—chronological, thematic, some combination? You have to maintain narrative momentum while including necessary context and analysis. You have to make complex historical events comprehensible without oversimplifying them.

Basu's solution is to keep the focus on the person at the center. Every chapter, every section, every paragraph should advance the reader's understanding of who this person was and what they did. Context and analysis are important, but they serve the biographical narrative rather than overwhelming it.

The revision process is also crucial. First drafts are often too long, too detailed, too focused on what the biographer finds interesting rather than what readers need to know. Cutting is painful—you've spent months researching something, and now you have to leave it out—but it's necessary for producing a readable book.

Basu had to leave out much of Panikkar's Malayalam literary work because she lacked the language skills to analyze it properly and because including it would have made an already long book unwieldy. This was a difficult decision, but it was the right one for the book she was writing—a biography focused on his public life and historical significance.

The reception of biography is also unpredictable. The VP Menon book came out just before the pandemic and immediately became controversial because of a political storm. Basu couldn't process what was happening because the pandemic overwhelmed everything. Only in retrospect did she understand the book's impact and reception.

The Panikkar book has been received more straightforwardly, but it still faces the challenge that he's not a household name. People know about Nehru, Gandhi, Patel, but Panikkar? He's a specialist's subject, someone historians know but the general public doesn't. Convincing publishers and readers that his story matters requires making the case for his significance.

This is part of Basu's larger project—bringing attention to behind-the-scenes figures who shaped Indian history but aren't famous. VP Menon, CB Mutama, KM Panikkar—these are people who made crucial contributions but aren't in the standard narrative. By writing about them, she's expanding our understanding of how history actually happens, which is rarely through the actions of a few great leaders but through the work of many people in many roles.

The future of biography in India is uncertain. The economics are difficult—biographies don't sell in huge numbers, advances are small, the research is expensive and time-consuming. The academic job market is terrible, so there's no institutional support for this kind of work. Yet there are so many important figures who deserve biographical treatment, so many stories that need to be told.

Basu's success despite these obstacles is encouraging, but it shouldn't require such extraordinary effort and resilience. The field needs more support—better funding for research, more publishers willing to take chances on serious non-fiction, more readers willing to engage with complex historical work. Until that happens, many important stories will remain untold.

Her advice to aspiring biographers is simple: figure it out. There's no clear path, no guaranteed method, no formula for success. You have to be willing to learn as you go, to make mistakes, to persist despite obstacles. You have to love the work itself, not just the idea of being a writer. And you have to be willing to hustle—to take on freelance work to pay the bills, to manage multiple projects simultaneously, to build a career through sheer determination.

The reward is the work itself—the satisfaction of bringing forgotten stories to light, of helping readers understand the past, of contributing to historical knowledge. It's not fame or fortune (those rarely come). It's the knowledge that you've done something worthwhile, that you've told a story that needed to be told, that you've honored the complexity and humanity of people who shaped our world.
