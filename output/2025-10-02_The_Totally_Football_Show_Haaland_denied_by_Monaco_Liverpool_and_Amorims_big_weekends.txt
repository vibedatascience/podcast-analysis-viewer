DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
Jimbo's joined by Jack Lang, Tom Williams and Liam Tharme at Totally HQ for a look back on all of Wednesday's Champions League festivities - and a look ahead to an intriguing weekend of Premier League action before heading into the October international break.

There was PSG getting the better of Barcelona, Eric Dier coming up clutch for Monaco against Man City late on - and wins for Arsenal and Newcastle in MD2 of the league phase.

Then we turn our attention to domestic affairs, pondering whether Nuno's West Ham can make it three consecutive wins for the Hammers at Arsenal, whether it's Chelsea or Liverpool who'll arrest their mini-slumps at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening - and whether Brentford can do a job on Pep's side yet again at the Gtech. Plus - could it be 50 and out for Amorim as Manchester United host high-flying Sunderland at Old Trafford?

All that plus the advent of the yellow and red card, a French spin on the Premier League - and Anthony Gordon's tribute to Diana,

Totally football show today, Champions League Wednesday. Olympia for some, a limp performance for others. We round up the results from Newcastle's Union busting to Monaco Man City and a dire decision question mark. Then it's Premier League match day seven, last round before the international break. Will the leaders be the gunners? Will Reuben be a gunner? Ponder it all. We're gunnner in this totally football show. Thursday, 2nd of October. Hi there listener. Got a totally crew for you today comprising Tom Williams. All right Tom. >> Hello James. All right. >> Lovely Tom. >> Thank you. Yourself also. >> Jack Lang's here. >> James. >> Lovely to see you Jack. And also welcome back Liam. >> Thank you. Good morning James. >> It's been a while Liam. >> It has. >> You've been on the athletics beat have I? Haven't you? Well I guess so. I guess I'm always on the beat. >> Yeah I bet you are. Yeah. >> Yeah. Ah, you mean athletics as in the sport as in the rather than the beat of the organization who we all work for. That momentarily threw me. But I get you. >> Oh, yeah. I can see the confusion. >> I I just That's the problem we Yeah. we have with it where >> we'll go again. Listen, you didn't hear that last You've been covering athletics for the Athletic. >> Yes, that's right, James. Bingo. Had good fun this summer. >> Listen, you join us just in time because we've already covered some meaty topics today. >> Tom's thrown in a bit of P. >> I mean, I was Jack forced me into it, but I did. Yeah. >> Yeah. What was the context, Tom? >> Jack was This is a rare for Jack. Very rare even, I would say. But he had made an inaccurate reference to Puce to Meline and as to when one might have recourse to refer to it. >> All right. I enjoyed his his m him deploying the meline, but as you correctly pointed out, it was >> a white whale situation. >> Yeah. I suppose this stems from the fact >> this stems from the fact that uh Cornwall famously lacks two things, Jack. >> Quite a lot of things, but um in the context that we were talking, yeah, a motorway and a KFC. Um so I was it was one of the things that I was disproportionately excited about when I moved to London at 18. >> Not the motorway, the KFC. I was dis disproportionately excited about the fact that Time Out have just announced that the coolest neighborhood in the world is in Tokyo and it's called Jimbo Town. Isn't that fun? >> Incredible. >> Jimbo Chaw. Uh, which is full of bookshops apparently, as you'd expect. Liam. And what else do we have this morning? Oh, yeah. Uh, what's his name? Renato Shampoo. >> Maro Shampoo. >> Yeah. Uh, so you were listening to our recent Totally Extra on the subject of the worst team in Premier League history, >> Derby County episode. Yeah. >> A sensitive and compassionate retelling of their calamity season. >> Yeah. Uh, and it rang a bell because I am currently writing a piece about a team that calls itself the worst team in the world. >> Yeah. I feel that's not really the the idea, is it? You're not supposed to be there though. >> Well, this is the thing, James. When the piece is out in a in a week or two, uh they actually really lean into it and they've made it their brand and are beloved for it. >> Okay. And who is u Masimo Shampoo? >> Uh Malro Shampoo. Uh the non Italian version of my guy was their uh star player in a in a way. Uh but only scored once in about 10 years. >> Okay. >> And is >> he looks fabulous. He looks for he's a hairdresser by profession. >> He looks a little bit like that unfortunate Man United fan who has vowed not to visit Abbas until United win five games in a row. How how are they doing on that? What's the closest they've come to five in a row? >> Is even won back to back games. I mean not not many teams win five in a row any even good ones you often get a draw or a loss in there. So five is >> I think it was two the whole of the last Premier League season. Two teams managed I think. >> And I think even Liverpool didn't manage five in a row did they? So there's always a rogue draw in there at some point and and that's that's fine. But if you're counting for five, then it's uh yeah, you might have a while to go yet. >> We'll discuss maybe whether they can start a new winning run uh this very weekend. But first of all, >> whether there's a danger that that becomes medically problematic at some point. At what at what point does does your hair get so heavy that he's going to require medical intervention? >> Cause of death. Manchester United. >> Yeah. Can you imagine? His head gets so heavy from the hair. You and I have many questions about >> this is why I as this is why I asked the question. I know not of what I speak but for many many millennia humans existed without barbers and as far as I know it was more likely to be a saber-tooth tiger or mammoth that killed >> getting in his eyes and he can't see. What if it causes an accident? You know >> have a hair band or tie it up. >> He's got a it's a proper It's a very real thicket of hair though, isn't it? He's got very thick looking hair. >> He has. We are in a new era of super chunky footballer headbands. >> I was going to mention >> Anthony Gordon's >> incredible covers his entire forehead. Absolutely massive acreage. >> Reminded me of the Sunderland fellow. What was his name? >> Sunderland headband. >> Yeah, massive. And he was bowled underneath. That was the thing. >> Jinho. >> Oh, Jvinho. >> Of Yeah, similar. >> Similar. Cuz I mean Anthony Alanganger >> sports a sizable headband >> but thin. but a thinner one. Anthony Alanganger's um sorry, Anthony Gordon's headband >> covers his entire forehead. >> Looks awful. I think >> something about Antony's and >> I mean clearly and there was someone on on playing for Union Sanjill Wy the opposition who was wearing like a little dainty kind of Patrick Burger style ' 90s headband and it was just a reminder that you don't need to >> you don't need to go that big. There are there are other options. I just I I find it an interesting stylistic decision. >> Okay. Have you seen that the tweet about um Anthony Gordon trying to do all the Lady Diana haircuts? He's probably just trying to escape that. I just got to get something to cover this up. >> Looking for a Lady Diana >> headband picture as we speak. Okay. Well, uh that was one of the takeaways from Wednesday night's action. Newcastle getting their biggest ever win in the Champions League proper 4-nil away at Union Sanwa. Elsewhere, Wednesday, he saw a late goal from Gonzalo Ramos as Paris man triumphed 2-1 away to Barcelona and Monique. Arsenal were two-nil winners against Olympia course. Manchester City meanwhile saw two points disappear right at the death of their clash with Monaco with Eric D winning and converting a penalty to make it 2-2. Same score line for Villa Real at home to Juventus and a late equalizer for the home side there too. courtesy of Renato Vega his first goal for the Spanish side. Napoli beat Sporting 2-1. Rasmos Hyland getting a brace there. Both set up by Kevin De Bruyne. Dortmund thumped Athletic Bill Bao 41. It was all square between Leuzen and Pis Fay and Carabag beat Copenhagen 2-0il. That's two wins out of two for the champions of Azabjan. I do want to call them prisoners. One of six clubs on two wins out of two. The other five being Arsenal, Inter Real Madrid, Bayern, and your Paris Sanja man. Woof. Should we start with the Paris Sanjan and their trip to Barcelona, the eagerly anticipated clash on Wednesday night? Gonzalo Ramos won the match there at Monique coming on as he does. Liam, scoring a winner as he does. Yeah, it's a great part of the PSG puzzle really that for all the kind of technical brilliance and diverse top players they've got, Lewis Enrique still got space in the squad for just a pure number nine. Um, you know, guys guys got a World Cup hat trick and you know it's kind of people see is almost reduced to coming off the bench and and playing a role that way but came off the bench to score in the in the Super Cup has had a lot of late goals for um for PSG across the seasons. Um and that's why he's he's there on a day where they don't have Usman Dembele and they you know start my Ulu um a youngster and more of a midfielder and kind of a false night where sometimes you need that player to come on especially when Barcelona were so aggressively high with that defensive line. >> A lot of people asking about that that's flick trademark is Bayern days and and and at Barca as well. >> Yeah. >> I mean I don't think the tactic was inherently a problem. It was kind of the left back and center back were trying to one was filling in with the other and they tried to basically switch back and then went oh no we've got to you know kind of panicked and that was why Aake I think ended up in so much space. So it was more the execution of it that was inherently a problem and it's a Martian thing as well cuz Ramos had obviously joged so far offside and held his position just right that um you know it was uh I think a really good PSG move rather than anything poor defensively. >> What what I did like was that it wasn't just onside because one defender was back the four players were playing on side. said, like if you're going to, you know, if if you're going to be done, be done like that. Tom, you weren't able to see any of this cuz you did. I did. I saw it all, James. >> I thought you were meant to be watching Monaco Man City both. >> I second screened. >> Which one was your first screen? >> PSG. >> Yeah. I think it was for all of us now. Did it I know it was a a cracking game and there was some beautiful moments in it. 27 shots in total. A late winner. Not for me, and I hope I'm not wrong about this, but it didn't quite live up to the And I feel that's because it was the second stage of the league league phase, and they all feel a bit like exhibition matches. >> What were you hoping for that was missing? What would you need? Is it more goals? >> No, it just didn't I didn't get the sense that it mattered too much. >> I I think there was a a slight tendency in the runup to be, oh, this was the the final that we should have had last year. And so they're kind of, oh, let's it's almost kind of a a go again. But yeah, there's just there's just no peril in the group stage. And I think it was a good match. It was in interesting some nice attacking football, but yeah, it did lack a little bit of the, you know, the pure uh desperation I think that comes with knockout football. And the reality is like I don't think any match in the group stage is going to get your heart pumping in this format, frankly. >> Right. I think people had that issue with the old group stage, but you had less time to make up any mistakes in that one. Whereas when you got eight, there's plenty of time to rectify any missteps. >> Although, you know, last season we saw that there was a degree of jeopardy towards the end of the league phase. You know, the PSG, Man City game, which was kind of the big turning point in PSG season that was in the league phase and that felt crucial and you know, Real Madrid, Man City also went into those matches needing results. But yeah, in the second group game, you're you're not going to have that that sense of jeopardy. But I thought it was a really impressive result for PSG, particularly given all the absentees. I mean, they were missing six of the players who started the Champions League final, five through injury, and January Don Roma, who's obviously no longer there. Um, and the first kind of 20 minutes made you think that they might really struggle. Barcel were on top. Barca got the opening goal but second half in particular it felt like they just kind of ground Barca down and you you kind of find yourself thinking a draw is a decent result here for PSG in the circumstances. So for them to go on and win it at the end with no Dembele Dwayia Joan etc is a really strong sign of you know of how much depth there is in their squad um and you know kind of shows that they remain the team to beat. Lovely to see Laminia Malach dribble in the second minute. >> Insane. When you think about the amount of expectation there is around him, >> the excitement that he generates, the extent to which people look forward to watching him and literally the first time he touches the ball, it's that little shimmy step over roulette, >> right? >> I think it's the best left back in the in the world as well according to Chat Lang. Yeah, I don't I don't see there's much of a debate about that unless you'd like to uh >> bring I bet. Well, you're probably a Federico Demarco >> fundamentalist. I think he is a very good player. Has been pretty bad recently. >> Um yeah, I don't see many other options out there to be honest and I you know I was writing about this in our briefing piece. For me actually >> an argument to be made he's the best fullback full stop. Hakeime would probably have something to say about that. But Mendes to me is maybe a little bit more complete than Hakeime. >> Better defensively, >> a touch better defensively, but also I think I think Mendes is a really good passer between the lines. Like he can do the whole bombing down the wing thing, right? >> Obviously set up the goal with a a run that drove him inside, but actually on the ball when he can pick out those passes like it's often Fabin Ruiz in between the lines. really astute passer of the ball as well and very young. Yeah, fantastic player. >> That goal that he set up for 19-year-old Sen Mayu who'd featured to devastating effect in that ever so tight Champions League final against in the opening goal from Barcelona. What a lovely what a lovely move that was. >> Marcus Rashford as well. The some people have questioned how well he would integrate with Barcelona, but he looked pretty integrated there. I didn't think he was in the game massively and it quite quite impressed me. It felt quite disjointed. A lot was going down Barca's right hand side because obviously they had Lea Mao there and I thought really they loo threatening when you made those regains in midfield. PSG had a few errors and it got to a point where it felt like Rashford and Yuma especially I think in the second half were kind of just clipping switches of play to each other as soon as they they got the ball back. So I think it was a sign of an attacker being in good form or you know real confidence um and like Hakeime tends to leave that space as well with how you know aggressive he tends to play. um that Rashford even though he wasn't kind of on the ball all the time, didn't have the touches that that UML did, definitely had a really big impact on the game. So, I think it, you know, bodess well for him. And then the Gonzalo Ramos goal in the 90th minute, which made it 2-1 and was the first ever 90th minute winner that a visiting team have scored at Barcelona in the history of European competition. That's a remarkable, remarkable stat. Best fullback in the world. Should he have actually had a red card in this game? Yeah, definitely. He was booked for a cynical/smart foul on Yamal in the first half and then tripped Yamal um pretty clearly on the edge of his own box >> uh about an hour in and yeah Michael Oliver I guess >> yeah Michael Oliver didn't >> just wanted us to chat about how good Mendes is today. >> The aura of new men that he's not you know referees are scared to send him off. >> Good week for the French e Tom. It was. Yeah. Marseilles with a fantastic win against Ajax on Tuesday. 4-0. Um and then Monaco completely unexpectedly >> getting a point off City. >> Very very deservedly. >> Very deservedly. I mean >> was it? >> Well, in the sense that they were under the Kosh. City hit the bar a couple of times. City created chances. City should have won, but you know, Monaco had spells of pressure. Donnaruma had to make a really good one-handed save from Magnus Alej with about half an hour to play. You know, they did manage to create periods of pressure and ultimately punish City for not doing more with all the possession they had. But yeah, I mean Monaco couldn't really have gone into this match in in worse nick. Uh a huge long list of of injury absentees. Um pretty sketchy form up to date. They lost 4-1 to Club Ruger in their opening game and defended like a team of under sevens. And in the prem pre-match press conference, Adi Hutter was asked for reasons to believe in his team and the only thing he could come up with was well in football you never know. >> In football you never know. Um which suggested that he accepted that they were probably going to lose >> right >> quite comfortably and as it as it turned out was not the case. >> No. Thanks to Eric Deer. >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean a long tradition of uh English footballers playing for Monaco and having their names mangled by commentators. In the late 80s you had Glenn and Mati. So now you have Eric Deer. >> I don't regard that as mangling. I think that's a significant upgrade given continental. >> It's I mean true you know I guess it depends on >> how do they introduce you on match ze >> Tom Williams. That's lovely isn't it? And then I have to pronounce all the team names in an absurd French accent. >> Go on then. >> Borneoose. They I cannot tell you how much French people struggle with Bournemouth because Bourne French people cannot pronounce the th >> so you get Borneamoose quite a lot. Borneoose. And obviously I can pronounce my th but I don't want to rub it in. >> So I kind of Bonamoose. >> Is it Southampton? >> Southampton. Yeah. Kennallorth Road. When Lut in the Premier League are you I mean all manner of pronunci >> and sometimes they will take an extremely bizarre looking name. >> Yes. >> And give it new life. Will Hughes. Who's got a more boring name than Will Hughes? I mean very few footballers. Will Ug. And you're watching Crystal Palace. Even if you're not really paying attention every time you hear it. UGOS. He was the other one. Jeff Schlup. >> Oh dear. >> Jeff Schlup in a French accent. Schloop. >> Jeff Schloop. somewhere there's an equivalent German podcast uh chroing over the mangling we do to various >> oh big time >> uh German names and so on and so forth but anyway that's fascinating little window >> that could be your next book about the language >> how to yeah how to mangle >> anyway we're talking about man city man city at Monaco uh Holland scored with his first touch of the game in fact that's extraordinary he scored two goals in this game taking him to 52 goals in 50 Champions League appearances is two goals in this game, but he only completed one pass in the first half. Remarkable passes when you >> That was a kickoff, was it? >> Sticking them in the back of the net. >> Well, the kickoff was one of his seven touches, I think, in the first half. Two of which resulted in his seven. >> And he was annoyed that he'd not scored more. >> Is that right? >> Cuz he had a chance at 1-1. Um, Philip Kern, the the Monaco goalkeeper, pushed out a shot and Harland came in kind of looked like he had an open goal, but it was quite a tight angle. and then second half towards the end um he had a shot that was that was well saved but it's I wouldn't say it's becoming a recurring problem for City but this is I think the the third or fourth time this season where they've seem to be in control of a game and and not put it to bed obviously that's what happened against Arsenal >> with the draw Gabriel Martinelli equalizing in stoppage time similar thing happened in the defeat at Brighton where they went ahead got pegged back and then conceded a eight winner and in terms of their possession and the chances they created, I mean, okay, they hit the crossbar twice, so they were literally millimeters away from winning this game, you know, 3-1 or or 4-1, but it is a bit of an issue. And I kind of wonder in this new phase in City's development where they they don't just completely dominate all aspects of the game and they look to hit on the break a little bit more. Does it make them a bit more vulnerable to being caught out like this at the end of games? >> I would have thought the opposite. No. If you're >> well, if if City are setting up their stall in the opposition half and and just keeping their opponents a mile from their goal, then it doesn't matter that they're not adding a third or a fourth goal. But when they're content to sit back, which they do more or more frequently these days, >> possession in a day, >> it leaves them open. And you know, Monaco had made a couple of decent chances even before the free kick that led to the the penalty at the end. >> We should salute Jordan Tez is it? >> Yes. Yes. Tez, teas, >> teas, I think, >> who equalized for Monaco straight after Erling Holland's first goal. And then the second Monagas strike was from the spot curse of Eric Dier who'd won the penalty after being kicked in the head. Or was he? Was that fair, do you think, Jarrett? What was your take? >> I didn't see it multiple times. I think he was shinned in the head. looked reasonable. It was like the Wayne Rooney overhead kick against Man City in 2011 of penalty area challenges and that it was shin rather than foot. >> What I like though is that Dier took the penalty with like grassy debris still on his forehead. >> No, but I like that in this like you watch, you know, >> Cristiano Ronaldo look at himself on the big screen a 100 times a game and touch his hair and a lot of players do this just like yeah I'm in the battle in the zone. >> Excellent. Great. You had something else I think you wanted to offer on this game. >> Yeah, I mean with City, what strikes me a lot with Guardiola, not just this season, but in previous seasons, is I think it's quite a rare thing for an elite team to have a non-fixed be best back four. Like City rotate at the back more than any other top team I can think of. You've got Guardio playing left back one week, center back the next week. Akanji right back center back been sold to I've been loaned to Inter into Inter Milan. They've got Kusenov playing some weeks doesn't play for then three or four weeks. John Stones disappears for months at a time. Comes back in at right back. Rico Lewis is right back center midfield. You've got all these players. They're all really good but there's no settled back four. And I think that you know Guardiola has forgotten more about football in the last 10 minutes than I will ever know. But it strikes me as quite um quite rare. >> Curiously, at a time when he's, you know, shifting things around in his defense, his midfield and attack are more settled than they have ever been. I can't remember there having ever been a time before when you knew which midfield and attack would be aligned. And I think that speaks to the fact that we are still emerging from City's very problematic last season. And God, I don't think Guardiola trusts himself to make loads of changes in attacking areas week to week. He knows that when it's, you know, Silva, Foden, Rinders, Docu Harland, they're going to do what he wants them to do. But, and I guess it's it's also a reflection of the injury situation, Chaki being out, Malmush being out, etc. But in almost every other previous Man City season, there has just been this constant conveyor belt of changes in attack. in the last few weeks the the the famous pep roulette which FPL managers in particular have known to have come to you know leared to regret um but at the present time there is a very set hierarchy in >> in in midfield and attack >> I think he's done that with center backs for a long time now though especially with Ruben Diaz and kind of seasons gone past and he said that kind of they've all got different profiles and city end up playing sort of different types of games against different teams and therefore he needs those different profiles I mean when you look at how this this starting 11 is kind of balanced. It It's like a textbook modern kind of Guardiola against a back five low block um type team where you've got basically four big dudes at the back. You've got a center back playing out at right back. Um you've got, you know, Rodri sat in the kind of number number six ro. You got your big guy up front and then you've got four small technicians and and quick technical players all kind of in in midfield and out wide. And it's just that massive contrast where, you know, the the size and physicality difference of where he does want it with his kind of proper defenders at the back and there where he then wants kind of his his pocket players and his his technical guys out wide. They're at Brenford at the weekend who've got an excellent record at home. Held Chelsea to draw, beat Aston Villa, beat Man United last time out. Be interesting to see if City stays settled for that one. Uh we'll talk more about Premier League match day. What are we on now? seven a bit later on but the other Premier League sides Arsenal with two no winners against Olympiaos Martelli started the scoring sacka ended it g with couple of nervy moments in between including a shot from Daniel Podens which brought one of the saves of the midweek did you see this Liam >> I I did it's a curious award though know a save of the midweek is a it's a >> it's a thing is it >> yeah yeah it's a thing I would offer the van the Vana Malinkovic Dave in Napoli's clash with Sporting in which he was essentially going the wrong way but still managed to swat swat the ball phenomenally powerfully away. Just kind of probably went out for a throw in or something. He really whapped it. But anyway, yeah, both great saves. Let's just enjoy them both, eh? >> Well, indeed. But yeah, hell of a save from Ry. And I I think Joe Cole made this point on the the TNT coverage last night, but >> there was an awful lot of skepticism when Arsenal signed him because he was taken over from Aaron Ramdale and Ramdale young English goalkeeper doing reasonably well. But you know, Rya, I think now is among he's not one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but he's in the group of goalkeepers right below that. He's super consistent, pulls off some extraordinary saves, is excellent with the ball at his feet, extremely consistent, wins Arsenal points I in the manner of a, you know, a goalkeeper in a title winning team, right? >> And I think it's to, you know, I think it's to Arsenal's credit that they saw that potential. I don't think anyone else was looking at David Ryer at that point and thinking this is a guy who can be a kind of, you know, final piece in the in the jigsaw. >> There you go. David Ryer, very good. Not quite as good as some others, but still good enough to maybe win a title. Who would be the ones that you'd have at the top of the pile? I'm guessing. Is there a TBO Corttois in there? >> Yeah. Well, Corttois, Donna Rumor, >> Don Rum, you'd have him in there. Yeah. >> Yeah. I think on the back of last season. >> Um, >> they're all more specialists though, right? Ry's big strength is he's probably eight out of 10 and everything. He's one of the best in in the league in terms of kind of dominating his box. You imagine it works quite well with Arsenal training, just practicing all the swinging corners and he deals with them just fine. and most other kind of goalkeepers can't that you know Brenford for so long he was so good at when they were sat deep and just facing crosses he could come out and protect them that way so I think to have all those elements at a really good level probably isn't quite the Donnaruma kind of shots stopper or quite the yeah Allison one v1's or Edison kind of with the distribution but I think to have all of those at a really high level is is really important and sometimes better than having just one pure specialist >> right cuz Nuna Mendes is the best fullback in the world so I'm keen to find out who the best keeper is Jack I was I was going to mention Allison Right. We have >> enormous hands as well, David Ryder. I mean, lots of goalkeepers do, but he has famously like basketball player size hands. >> And there's on his mosaic next to the Emirates, he's kind of posing with his hands like that. >> It's just around the corner from me. So, I I see those hands. I don't see the actual hands. I see >> perspective, Tom. >> I I think it's partly perspective. >> Size. Yeah. Not as big. >> They're big old hands. I'm telling you. >> Is it to scale the the >> It look It looks to scale. I've not I've not measured it. I'll report back. Leave it with me. >> A lot of people with a lot of love for Urugard's performance in this game as well. >> This is very unscientific, but he just looked bouncy like >> it was he has been quite bad for quite a while and he looks just kind of going through the motions. He had that kind of >> ode at his best uh just energy to him. played a couple of really lovely through balls, one of which would have led to a goal if Victor Yarez had passed. >> Good lord, Tom's just show perspective is the key word. >> Yeah, they are. Are they bigger or just closer to the screen? >> They are. I think there's Hang on. I saw a measurement before. >> Okay, Tom's going to look at that. I'll mention that after >> 22 cm. >> How big that is? >> How big is that? His leng the length from the tip of his middle finger to the base of his palm estimated to be 22 cm. This hand size is disproportionate to his height >> and is roughly 3 cm longer and 2.3 cm wider than the average male hand >> making it an advantageous attribute for a goalkeeper. >> I think all goalkeepers will have hands >> probably to an extent. Same way you got like high jumpers that have all got like an 8ft long achilles tendon just cuz that is what makes you then good at >> is that right? >> Yeah. Not 8 foot. I've exaggerated, but I don't know. I might fold back and forth. Strange stuff goes on in the body. Lord knows. Newcastle, we touched on this before. 4-nil winners away at Unan Sanjel, who' started the Champions League phase with a big 3-1 win away at PSV. So, this good result. And yet another goal from VA, although his his how how much was his involvement key to that goal? Well, he could have probably moved out the way and it still have gone in. I think more hit him. Well, it's, you know, I don't want to go textbook. Um, you know, good feet for a big guy, but I'm I'm still uncertain if he actually flicked it or if he hit hit the defender. It took me a lot of rewatches and I wasn't sure. >> I think he did. >> Yeah, >> cuz he kind of celebrated, but I couldn't tell if it was enough of a celebration where it was his goal and you didn't kind of see a conversation between him and Tali where he's like, "No, no, you know, you get some as a strike point." No, it's me. I've touched it kind of thing. was >> um he kind of let celebrate. So yeah, whether it was a a hierarchical thing of respecting a more senior player, I don't know, but it would be quite funny if you just kind of let someone else think that they've scored the goal and they go, "Actually, I've I've got that mate." Um but uh no, neat neat flickman who's been in the news all week once people picked up on Kah Rumigger's comments that Newcastle was stupid to pay that much money. Not stupid to buy him, but stupid to pay that much money. But when you look at his performances so far, three goals in just four starts for his U club, you could make an argument that of all the Bundesliga goalc scoring signings this summer, he's been the most effective. >> I think a risky comments to make, right, cuz they only really would, you know, if he does perform poorly, I don't think you're ever very much vindicated by that. It's more likely to be a thing that's that's quite motivating for a club and a player to to hear that that some egg left on face. >> And you can understand Bayern's frustration. I mean, traditionally, it's so hard for them to sign players from their Bundesers League rivals. So you it must really great to see another one slipping through their fingers. >> Anti Gordon had two penalties. Harvey Barnes completed the victory. Among the positives were Anthony Gordon on one side and Elanganger on the other. Newcastle fans calling this his best performance yet for the club which interesting cuz they've got his old side turning up at the weekend. >> Well, it was the first time that those three players have lined up from the start. Um, and on paper that looks like Newcastle's first choice front three. And the Langanger was brilliant. I mean, just so quick that there's very little you can you can do against him. I mean, if he wants to beat a fullback, chances are he he just will. And it was his cross in towards Voltoard that that paved the way for the opening goal. Gordon scores the two penalties. And I thought Gordon's work rate was exceptional. He's he wins the ball back at the start of the move that leads to the fourth goal scored by Harvey Barnes coming off the bench. And Newcastle's issue this season so far has been scoring goals. They've been extremely solid. I think they've had what three nil nil draws. Um and so defensively they've looked pretty pretty solid. It's it's been an attack that things haven't been clicking. This performance um against Sanj Well suggests that things might actually be starting to click. >> Excellent. In the league, they're currently down in 15th spot Newcastle United as they wait for Forest at the weekend. Forest who are in action tonight as we record Thursday evening in the Europa League they are hosting Micheland so maybe and will have won a game as forest manager by the time they go to St. James's. Anyway, elsewhere in the Champions League, Juve had a two-2 draw with Villa. As we mentioned, Renato Vega with a late equalizer. >> Miss of the week by a mile by Jonathan David in that. Oh, poor guy. >> Poor guy. Far post uh travel. The ball's going quite fast. He just chooses the wrong foot to kick it with. It's great. >> Ras Hand got a brace as Napoli beats Sporting at the Maradona. and Kevin De Bruyne who finished their game at the weekend in slightly fracturous fashion uh arguing with Conte or at least letting his dissatisfaction be very visible as he left the field after being subbed off by Antonio Conte. The defeat by Milan responding here with well that first assist was glorious. Now he gallops 50 yards or so and then slides it through for Raasmas Hland and Raasmas Holland's now got three goals in five games. three goals as many as he scored in 35 games for Man United last season. >> H proving the the continued point about players leaving Manchester United either getting better or reverting to just kind of how good they were before. The the first one is a textbook coil and right kind of the big spaces in transition. But the the second goal one is is really nice. I mean it's a great ball in kind of a reworked short corner and like an inswinging cross from a slightly deeper angle. But he's he's pretty brave. if he gets like right between goalkeeper and um you know center back proper like oldfashioned like English number nine type header of you know get get your head between um yeah the the keeper and the defender and um yeah really really good finish excellent good result as well for Napoli Dortmund had a 4-1 win against athletic club de Bilbao Dortmund who were held to a 4-4 draw by Juventus in their opening game piling on the goals for the second match in a row in this competition Connie Chukamea among the scorers and Admy looking dangerous and Dortmund things basically leveren weren't so fortunate finished 1-1 there clash with PS the Peter Bosch derby as producer Charlie dubbs it he offers this fun fact in leveren starting 11 was Tilman and PSV's starting 11 were both till and man >> very nice >> it's an unusual weekend in the Premier League starts on the Friday four games on the Saturday and then five on a Sunday. That's thanks to this uh Europa League and Europa Conference League business Friday. Anyway, it's Bournemoose up against is it Fulham? Did they say no? Fulham. >> Fulham. The Cherries will go second if they win that game for a day at least. Saturday at lunchtime it's lead against Spurs. Then at 3:00, Man United Sunderland, one of those teams is in fifth place, the other is in 14th. Sunderland, in fact, made the best start by a newly promoted side for 13 years in the Premier League >> since Big Sam's West Ham is >> indeed indeed. >> Football heritage right there. >> And the other game at 3:00 is Arsenal West Ham. Is that right? West Ham. >> Okay. Arsenal. >> Leam. >> They like they like nicknames a lot. And they use curious nicknames that have fallen out of fashion in this country. >> For example, >> like when was the last time you heard someone refer to leads as the peacocks? >> I'm sorry. >> We get that quite a lot. Uh the peacocks keto peacocks, >> right? What do they call Spurs then? >> Lily whites. >> No, they just Le Spurs. >> Okay. >> Cuz you got a peacock cockal derby Saturday, lunch. >> Yes. Yeah, >> that is going to be vicious. Arsenal West Ham anyway Leurs and Arsenal will go top with a win >> for a couple of hours at least because at 5:30 current number one Liverpool >> will be trying their luck away at Chelsea. Liverpool have lost their last two in all competitions. Chelsea have lost their last two in the Premier League. So interesting game that one. Sunday four games taking place at 2:00. Wow. Everton Palace, Newcastle Forest, Wolves Brighton and Villa Burnley. Hm. Then at 430 capping the round off, Brenford, Man City. Wow. Quick reminder at the top of the table. Liverpool are two clear of Arsenal. Palace are a point behind. Then you got Spurs, Sunderland and Bournemouth a point behind them and one ahead of Man City. Down at the other end, Burnley, West Ham, and Wolves are the bottom three with Wolves already four points from safety. Man United, Newcastle, Villa and Forest are all within a defeat of the relegation places. Kriky wonder what it's going to look like after this weekend when we got of course an international break with all that that implies a lot of people wondering if clubs might be eyeing up that extended period without football maybe making some tweaks to their organization. Hm. Among the many questions is what kind of effect Nuno Spiritto Santo will have had at West Ham. He got a point away at Everton after one day's training now with a week with the Liamas. Could they could they go and do their usual number on on the Gunner Lugers? >> Yes. I mean, yeah, West Ham in recent years have had a great record against Arsenal. Um they've won their last two visits to the Emirates. In fact, the Gunners have only lost four of their last 42 matches at home and two of those were against to West Ham. >> And wasn't there there was the >> draw at the end of 2022 23 season that like served as one of the many nails in the coffin of Arsenal's title ambitions. So even when they're not beating Arsenal, they're they're doing them damage. And you know, we did see in that game at Everton some indications as to, >> you know, what Nuno was going to is going to bring to West Ham. Full Krug straight in. So he likes a big strapping number nine. Callum Wilson out, Full Krug in. And on paper looking at the respective form of the two teams, particularly Everton's home form, you thought, okay, well, this would be a comfortable Everton victory. And you know, West Ham came out of it with a a creditable draw. Um, and you would expect that Nuno will will tighten them up. Um, I mean, you know, they have been extremely poor um since the start of the season. Uh so yeah, I guess the expectation is that he will make them make them harder to break down. And as much as they tried to kind of stray from the David Moyes formula in appointing Julen Lopeeti and then Graeme Potter, you kind of feel like in the the West Ham DNA, that kind of football is probably still present. So perhaps it won't be all that difficult to kind of reconfigure them back to what they were before. He did something in that Everton game which I always love when a new manager does this when they come in. Just picked out a player that I never heard of. This may just be me, but Sunutu Magasa the defensive midfielder. You're straight in there. You're my guy. I think that's such a fun statement of intent, but if you look at the West Ham team, they have so many good players like Bowen is in great form. Pakata is a great player. Matteos Fernandez I thought was in a really bad Southampton team. He was had a good season last season. They have got the players some of them back him and um JF down that left side especially I mean J's like the quality of his his crossing is is absolutely fantastic. You think that seems like kind of a nailed recipe of of good crosser plus big man um in in the penalty area that thrives off crosses should should bring them goals. Um I think the the big issue for them this weekend against Arsenal is where Sam being utterly object to defending corners in particular. I mean, it was the second face ball, fair enough for um the the Everton opener, but they did leave Michael Keane in in I think probably close to an acre of space in in the box on his own. Um and obviously Arsenal were a phenomenal set piece team. So probably the game plan needs to be conceded as few corners as possible rather than try and actually defend them particularly well. But as as the guys say, I think, you know, that whole attack probably needs to be built more around Bowen than than Forg. Bowen's kind of versatility. He can score, he can create. um you know he always seems to pop up with with goals when they need it as well. Um and they've just got such a capacity to come alive in a period West Ham I think you can watch them for the game they can be poor for 60 minutes 70 minutes but will often have a 15 20 minute spell where they can get something from the game and without ever kind of being convincing. So there's there's all the ingredients there and that's without Thomas in the midfield as well who's been been a key player. >> A lot of positives there for the Hammers as they travel to Arsenal. It's a delicate weekend this for the title race. Liverpool who are two points clear. We talked about this a little bit in Wednesday's show. Their trip to Chelsea. Not only they looking to avoid a third defeat in a week on his lot side, but they'll also be doing it without Allison, one of the top keepers in the world. And Katik is a doubt two. I believe >> he came off early week. So you'd think so. I mean doubt for whether he would be starting anyway. I think I don't think Ana Slot has yet done the EAC echk double act. Might be something we see in the future. But yeah, interesting with Liverpool because you know probably only 10 days ago everyone was saying they're not playing their best but they're still winning. This is such a fantastic sign and how quickly things can you know turn around. Not just in terms of the injuries but in terms of the the way the attack particularly is clicking. There's there are a lot of noises about Salah's form rightly so I think whether he and Vitz can can do uh do their individual things while also creating the kind of uh synergy that Liverpool had last year >> and and Vert's positional presence in the team what it means in terms of players who who aren't there and and and the lack of consistency in midfield as a result. Chelsea though bare bones at the back. Uh Trevor Shalabar suspended for this game. So probably going to see some of those unfamiliar names that you like so much Jack Lang lining up. >> Yeahongs get in there. >> Your Joro Hatos indeed. It is ironic given that Enzo Mesa spent a significant proportion of the summer politely and perhaps not so politely asking the club to sign a new center back for him and he was told no you've got enough. And now that is really being tested because they're almost all injured. Um, and Chelsea are not looking very good. >> 5:30 on Saturday, those two teams face off. City, meanwhile, who are currently a ways back in seventh spot, fully 10 points, no fully five points behind Liverpool are at Brenford who, as I mentioned for Man United last weekend, have that great record at home and have an eagle Thiago who's in redhot form. five goals this season in all competitions. Not a player that was on a lot of people's radar. Jack, were you kind of expecting big things from him? >> All I'd seen of him was the form he had in Belgium with bugger because he he was not someone who was particularly famous in Brazil. Then went to Ludigretz, which is probably my now Shaktar uh slightly off radar. My my favorite Brazilian outpost in Eastern Europe. Always two or three. Actually, I looked at their lineup in the Europa League last week and I think they were all of their attackers were Brazilian which and they had kind of a deeply uh kind of standard domestic defense and then just like wild card attackers all wearing like number 99 jersey. Fantastic stuff. Uh don't watch much Ludigrets though I have to say. So he was not on my radar at that point. Reminds me a little bit of there's a kind of strain of Brazilian strikers that the Premier League has been quite interested in in the last few years. I think Joe Ellington, obviously a different player now, was kind of in that mold. You kind of your muscle bound guys. So yeah, it kind of I mean his goals against Manchester United, I kind of think he sliced the first one and was a little bit lucky with it and the second one kind of hit him. So I'm not getting super excited yet. >> Come on. What I'm getting excited about is the fact that Ludigrett are facing real Bettis >> this evening. >> Green on green. Two rare green kits. Krikey, I'm sure one of them will wear an away kit >> maybe. Anyway, Eago Thiago though no longer of that parish taking on Man City. That's Sunday 4:30. And anybody want to predict City dropping points here? >> I mean, City haven't been brilliant this season in the league. And as we say almost every time we talk about City, there's this temptation to to think that, you know, things have clicked and they're back. Um, but there I think there is still a vulnerability there. you know, they showed against Burnley that um they're still capable of of scoring lots of goals and and um >> showed against Monaco conceding them. >> Well, indeed, indeed. And like you say, you know, Brenford decent home form, you know, a bit of a free hit for them. >> Uh you know, City obviously favorites, but I think the fact that Brenford have, you know, have got these decent home results under their belts that, you know, eager Thiago is is is now finding his feet, you know, they'll they'll fancy their chances. Is Keith Andrews early, I'm not sure if you've been able to to look at this. Is he essentially just rolling out the same kind of Thomas Frank tactics as before or has he made any significant changes? Um, I think part of the shape is is the same kind of a base 4-33. They've made some kind of changes at fullback. They've obviously had transfers and you can't copy and paste the kind of the same formula because they've lost kind of key forward. So, I think it's about reworking and re-engineering kind of the forward line. They've got Rico Henry now coming back into things which is really big. He'd been out for an awfully long time I think with him and Michael Kyode a right back who has got a I think he's a really wellrounded um fullback has played win back at times. Humongous long throw like can absolutely launch the ball. We're very much in an era of long throws in the Premier League now. >> But sometimes from guys that can throw it okayish and they're kind of gambling on second balls. This guy like a javelin. It's interesting to see the long throws in the Champions League midweek. Did you see Western McKenna lobbing them in for that? Wow. I watched remember a few years ago for um the US and he for a small guy has got a bit of power about him >> and he has a slightly different approach because he very much favors his right arm almost like a quarterback. >> Vinnie Jones used to do that when he was on long throw duty for Wimbledon. He would basically have his throwing hand behind the ball and the left hand would kind of like accompany it and it looked a little bit like an illegal action. But who's going to tell Vinnie Jones that he's throwing it in wrong? Not me. >> Absolutely. Brenford very much the kings of the long throw >> in the world's number one division for long throw football Premier League. Today is the anniversary of in many things I imagine. But red and yellow cards being introduced to the football league. Do do you know when which year they first made their appearance? >> '7s. >> Wow. Jack, you're absolutely spot on. 1976. >> I would have thought it was ages ago. Well, I mean, I suppose 76 is ages ago, but even more ages ago than that. >> And of course, red cards were circular back in the day, so you could tell the difference on on TV >> amongst other reasons. But I think that was ref so they could find the card more easily. They tell by the shape rather than >> So you just put them in different pockets probably. >> Well, that's what they do now. >> And you could also show the red card and then just frisbee it at the player as they walked off the pitch as referees often do. serving as summons and if it touched you, you were off. But if you could avoid it, just um >> Anyway, uh the system of two fouls involving expulsion had of course existed before, but there hadn't been a physical demonstration of of the kind of status where you were >> the old Paul Durkin off. >> I don't know, Liam. >> You're just point off. You're off lad. They always said lad. >> First player to be shown car was Blackburn's David Wagstaff. The second Jack scare me. Do you know who the second player ever to be shown a red card in the uh English football first division was? >> Uh no idea. Mark Lorenson >> football's George Best. >> Second best. >> Well, in that case, yeah. Oh, remember when orange cards were going to be a thing? This a couple of seasons ago they were Were they trial in youth football? >> Tactical fouls specifically as well. I think like Simben stuff as well. >> Interesting interesting concept. Topically enough, uh, green cards, football green cards currently being used at the under 20 World Cup in Chile. Uh, they are though not a disciplinary thing so much as an opportunity for the coaches. They're a bit like, you won't recall it's a knockout frontier, but when the teams will play their joker, the coaches can pull out their green card, hopefully brandish it at the referee. When they want to challenge the referee's decision, they can do it twice a match. So I guess they get two of them and then the referee will review. This is at the under 20 World Cup in Chile. The referee will then review with the assistance not of VR but FSV football video support a rival a rival organization looking to muscle in. >> They always should have used I think VR and the appeal style bas. And it's it's instead of V. >> Yes. >> So this is the only video refereeing that takes place at this tournament. So you can you can only summon the VFSV >> with the green card, which I think is is good. And I'm I'm I'm encouraged that FIFA are triing this because I think it reflects the fact that there is still data about the way that V is used and that perhaps it might one day be put in the bin where it belongs. >> I'm really excited about this FSV. What's it offering? Like have we been was VAR Betamax this whole time? Maybe >> it's not even FSV. It's FVS. >> Yeah, >> I'm reading the notes wrong. >> Very Bundesliga >> football video support. F. They've taken this from ice hockey, of course, where coaches can have a coach's challenge. But the the neat thing there is that if their challenge is not successful, >> they can punch them. >> Their team their team then incurs a minor penalty. So they have to go a player down. If you appeal a referee, >> you imagine the carnage of this in the Premier League, can't you? And then who do you does the referee pick who goes off or >> maybe you just get a yellow card against one of your players? >> I can imagine the theatricality as well of like >> 95th minute Jose Mourinho getting off the bench. What is he doing? He's got the green card in his hand. He's seen something. >> Yeah. >> Obviously not Mourinho cuz he's not in the Premier League anymore. >> Not right now. But dot dot dot >> kind of person who you think would enjoy having a >> some opportunities coming up in the Premier League soon. >> We've got one or two teams in trouble. We've got an international break coming up and we all know do we actually I mean to what extent are international breaks percentage-wise more filled with managerial departures. >> That is a great paging Duncan Alexander for this one. He that man will have that on a spreadsheet somewhere. Um I think it's it's compounded this season by I mean Sunland especially but um I guess less so Burnley but collectively the promoter teams um started fairly well. Um and obviously you then if you've not got kind of the feels like no gimmies of who might go down this season, you've got more established Premier League teams, West Ham Wolves in in real trouble. Um that just naturally I think applies more pressure that in in seasons gone by they might have started as badly as this year. But if teams are doing worse than them then it wouldn't kind of feel the same. It's always relative and I think that um is is probably a healthy thing for the league in in general those promoted teams doing well. But bad news for any managers um struggling teams, they are going to be under pressure. In unrelated news, Manchester United are facing Sunderland this Saturday at 3:00. It's Ruben Amarim's 50th game in charge and there are those saying, is it going to be 50 and out because it's been that bad so far. We don't need to run through the the litany of of of of failure that they've had there. But Sunderland, let's talk instead about them. Best start by newly promoted side Tom as you were confirming since Big Sam's West Ham 13 years ago. Is Reggie Lee is he is he a big talking point for your matches a day? Yeah, he is. We will we've had him we've interviewed him a couple of times. We've filmed a couple of things in Sunderland. Obviously a lot of French and franophhone players in in the changing room. Um, so yeah, lots of interest and, you know, it's it's been a while since there was a French coach in in the Premier League, you know, kind of doing great things and Ernie Claudit. So there's a lot of interest in in what he's doing. Um, >> how do you pronounce the name? >> There's this conjecture about this in France as well because I've heard Lubric and Lubri, but I've heard Lubric more than Liber. >> Say Lis, it's very Breton, right, the name. Yeah. Yeah. Good knowledge. Last three goals that Sunderland have scored have all been assisted by Granite Shaka. How do you pronounce that in match? Oh no, I'll stop. But anyway, Sunderlander Sunland is such a fantastic uh story this season and we'll see if it continues. Man United, nobody wants to see somebody lose their position, but after all the indignities they suffered getting beaten at home by Sunland, >> it would wrap things up, wouldn't it? I mean the thing with Amhareim his 50th game it brings to mind the is it the Shane War line on Monty Panasonar he hasn't played Amarim hasn't managed 50 games he's managed the same game 50 times and that applies more here than it probably did to Monty Panasonar because just yeah I mean I I was quite positive on Amarim early doors and I think probably uh a feeling of goodwill has lasted longer than it has for for some people. But yeah, I I it's got to the point now at which it's actually hard to imagine him clawing this back. And I think that happens to every manager eventually. Like you look at him and you you don't see >> I see as opposed to the normal paradigm where you got a manager fighting to save his job and a club who are weighing up their options. With him, it seems more like a manager who's fighting desperately to leave and a club that's determined to keep him rather than admit they got it wrong. >> Yeah. Like his interviews, I think there's a fine line between honesty and um defeatism because the manager's job is a is a performative job whether you like it or not. You are representing yourself >> when your team is taking a penalty, >> right? >> To stare at the floor as though disaster is about to happen is surely not uninspiring. He was way too honest way too early about how poor and not very good um United were. Um there's an extent to which it's you know good to be honest and and not do the stick of this is a a massive football club. We deserve or ought to be kind of top four or title chasing and we're just not there because there's some kind of forces at play. Um but I think as Jesus to be yeah so defeated about it and I think it it seems to struggle to kind of get you out of that pit. Um, if there's one green shoot, they've been good going forward in terms of chance creation this season. The bad problem is they've been very, very wasteful, the most wasteful team in the league. Um, in terms of XG, they're actually the the top side. Obviously, part of that is because they end up in quite a few losing game states as well, which is an even bigger problem and have to chase games and therefore make chances. But, um, the system as far as it goes to creating opportunities is is working. Um, but obviously it's an equally big problem that players aren't aren't putting that way. Whether that's because it's individuals being wasteful. Um good goalkeeping, a mix of other things. Um that is just a bigger problem I think um and needs to be resolved. Elsewhere in the Premier League this weekend, you got leads against Spurs. Spurs who had that 2-2 draw away against Boda Glimp on Tuesday. Bournemouth taking on Fulham on Friday night. Bournemouth enjoying their best ever start to a top flight season. Fulham, did you know they've committed the most fouls in the Premier League this season? Dirty Fulham Friday night. >> Very on off-brand the idea of Fulham as a load of hatchet men. >> Yeah. >> Sak. >> They've got a few in there, haven't they? It's it's it's Yeah, I'd say I think it's a good part of the style. >> You know, when you've been in a game against Fulham, >> four games at 2:00 on Sunday. Which one to watch though? You options are Aston Villa against Burnley. Everton Palace, strong contender that one. Newcastle Nottingham Forest is surely going to be highly entertaining. And then there's also Wolves against Brighton. Lots of those clubs involved in Thursday night football. Forest hosting Mitchelland Palace are away in Luben taking on Dynamo Kiev in the Conference League and Villa are at home. No, they're in Rotterdam against Fire Thursday night in the Europa League. Criy, which one of those your pick, Jack? Those four games. >> Uh, I would probably have to go for Newcastle Forest. >> Would you? I'm going Everton Crystal Palace because Palace are great >> and it's a lovely new stadium. >> Lovely. Liam Wolves Brighton. >> Why? >> Cuz I'm a Brighton fan. >> Oh yeah, that makes sense. >> Villa Burnley then. >> H very good. Uh what do you make of Brighton start to the season Liam? >> Good. Good enough. Um they've got a really good capacity that they've shown since the start of last season to play up against bigger clubs to um stage these really impressive comeback wins. I think Fabian Herzster has had some justified criticism of kind of his his tactics and um definitely playing lower half opposition. He's been really good at changing the game using his subs um and kind of changing tactics as well. We saw that at Chelsea where he made some changes. Brought on Danny Wbeck for um Georgian and then moved young men from the right to the left. Ma then provided an assist for Danny Wbeck um with a with a really good cross. So there's there's definitely work to be done. I think there's some questions still at center back and kind of how they um deal with teams trying to play in behind them, but I think generally speaking they've adapted really well to kind of losing J Pedro and having to reinvent once more. >> Excellent. Brighton currently lying 10th in the Premier League, but it's early doors of course. Palace doing so very very well and by the time you hear this or certainly by the time they travel to Everton could well be on a 19game unbeaten streak depending on what happens against Damu Kiev. Everton is it no wins in four now >> in the league? No wins in three. Yeah, I think if you had the League Cup defeat against Wolves, that's four. >> Yeah. So Everton no wins in four now. They did do the double over the Eagles last season, but you know that was then they won't have any Jews Hall in this game though on account of him picking up those five yellow cards. Tom, you were eager to tell us about Villa Burnley. Away you go. >> Yes. Villa showing signs that they might be turning a corner. Very scratchy win against Bologna in Europa League. Then went behind at home to Fulham and you thought, okay, well, here we go again. But then turned it around um you know to win. So that's two wins on the spin. You know, we'll see how they get on against Rotterdam tonight. But Ollie Watkins has finally got off the mark. So for the first sign this season, a little bit of momentum. >> Uh and we'll see whether that withstands the visit of Burnley. Sunday two o'clock and well you know bit later on on the Sunday we'll get together and discuss what it all means with our totally football show which as ever will have its recording livereamed on YouTube from around about 7:15 7:30ish but that wraps it up for today's show so many many thanks to Liam to Jack to Tom and to producer Charlie and you listener do hope you have a great weekend.
