**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Shift from Journalism to Marketing

***"There's a clear distinction between old school documentaries - warts and all - and the realization that we don't have to do that. We can make it shiny and polished and use this to sell ourselves rather than describe ourselves"***

The football documentary landscape has undergone a fundamental transformation over the past decade. Traditional documentaries like Graham Taylor's "An Impossible Job" from the early 1990s represented genuine journalistic endeavors that exposed the raw reality of football management. These productions captured authentic moments - Taylor's struggles with the England team, his interactions with the press, and the genuine pressure of international football. The footage from this era shows people who weren't media-trained, weren't aware of how to perform for cameras, and consequently revealed genuine human moments.

This contrasts sharply with modern productions where **clubs have become content houses**, essentially operating as production companies with valuable intellectual property. The shift accelerated after 2017 when Drive to Survive demonstrated that sports documentaries could attract entirely new audiences beyond traditional fan bases. Formula 1's success in reaching beyond "petrol heads" to create character-driven narratives showed other sports, including football, that documentaries could be powerful marketing tools. The modern documentary is **advertorial in nature** - carefully curated, professionally produced, and designed to project a specific brand image rather than reveal uncomfortable truths.

## 2. Sunderland Till I Die: The Last Authentic Documentary

***"The executives will have thought this has gone pretty well, but when exposed to the sunlight of broader scrutiny, that is not the takeaway"***

Sunderland Till I Die, produced by Fulwell 73, represents what many consider the last genuine "warts and all" football documentary. The series brilliantly walked a tightrope where club executives believed they were presenting themselves favorably while viewers saw something entirely different. The documentary captured the genuine desperation of a falling giant, the disconnect between boardroom and terraces, and the raw emotion of a community whose identity was intertwined with their football club.

**The genius of the production** lay in allowing subjects to reveal themselves naturally without editorial judgment. Club executives discussing tactics they clearly didn't understand, making promises they couldn't keep, and demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of their fanbase - all captured without commentary but devastating in impact. The series also pioneered what would become a documentary staple: focusing on the community and ordinary fans to demonstrate that football clubs are **avatars for places**, repositories of hopes and dreams that extend far beyond sport. This template of combining executive incompetence with touching fan loyalty would be attempted by many subsequent productions, but never with the same authenticity.

## 3. The All or Nothing Era and Club Control

***"It's scripted reality - like The Only Way Is Essex or Made in Chelsea. The people who act most unnaturally in these documentaries tend to be footballers"***

The All or Nothing franchise, beginning with Manchester City's 100-point season, marked a new era of club-controlled narratives. These productions, while offering unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, are fundamentally **extensions of club marketing departments**. The Manchester City edition struggled with narrative tension - how do you create drama when your subject wins almost every match 5-0? The famous confrontation between Fabian Delph and his teammates, where Delph demands they remember "the basics of football" while Guardiola insists "football is so complicated," provided one of the few genuine moments of conflict and insight.

**The Tottenham edition** revealed the calculated nature of these productions. Commissioned during the 2018-19 season when Spurs opened their new stadium and reached the Champions League final, the documentary was meant to announce "we are a big club now." The mid-season replacement of Mauricio Pochettino with Jos√© Mourinho seemed almost orchestrated for television - Mourinho being a far more willing and charismatic performer for the cameras. Daniel Levy's awkward attempts to appear relatable, including drinking a pint of Stella Artois in what appeared to be his first attempt at such an activity, highlighted the performative nature of these productions. The documentary became less about authentic insight and more about **projecting a global brand**, particularly targeting the American market where growth potential was seen as unlimited.

## 4. Being: Liverpool - Ahead of Its Time

***"Brendan Rodgers has never really recovered from that"***

Fox's Being: Liverpool in 2012 was simultaneously pioneering and catastrophic. FSG's attempt to import American sports documentary traditions to English football was conceptually sound but executionally flawed. The production, narrated by Clive Owen with a script clearly written for American audiences but delivered in an English accent, created a bizarre linguistic disconnect. **The infamous scenes** - Brendan Rodgers with a portrait of himself in his home, Ian Ayre on his motorcycle - became defining images that overshadowed any sporting achievement.

The documentary's legacy is complex. While it made Rodgers a figure of ridicule just as he was building a team that would come within touching distance of the Premier League title, it also **presaged the entire documentary boom** that would follow. Every element that would become standard in later productions appeared here first: the local poet in the pub, the fizzing pint on the table as a symbol of working-class authenticity, the attempt to explain the club's cultural significance to a global audience. FSG were simply too early - football culture wasn't ready for this level of exposure, and the production team hadn't yet learned how to balance authenticity with image management.

## 5. The Wrexham Model and Its Replication

***"It's a cross between Sunderland Till I Die and Ted Lasso - and it has worked really well"***

Welcome to Wrexham represents the perfection of the football documentary formula. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's purchase of the Welsh club was allegedly inspired by watching documentaries during lockdown, though McElhenney has given different origin stories to different interviewers. The series succeeds by **combining authentic community storytelling with Hollywood production values**. The owners' genuine investment - both financial and emotional - in the club's success creates natural narrative tension lacking in club-controlled productions.

The show's success in America has been extraordinary, with Wrexham now selling out stadiums on US tours. The documentary has transformed a National League club into a **global brand** while maintaining local authenticity. The production carefully balances multiple audiences: local fans who want their story told respectfully, American viewers seeking Ted Lasso-style feelgood narratives, and neutral observers interested in the broader story of football's globalization. The ethical questions - using a working-class institution for content creation - are offset by tangible benefits: investment, success, global recognition, and a sustainable business model that didn't exist before.

## 6. Birmingham's Cynical Replication

***"Tom Brady didn't know who Wayne Rooney was when they met - there was a point when Rooney was more famous than Tom Brady"***

Tom Brady's Birmingham City documentary represents the cynical endpoint of the Wrexham model. Where Reynolds and McElhenney showed genuine engagement with their community, Brady appears disconnected and uninterested. The documentary's most revealing moment comes when Brady questions Wayne Rooney's "energy levels," apparently unaware he's speaking to one of England's greatest ever footballers. **The cultural disconnect** is palpable - Brady and his associates driving around Birmingham in a limousine, explaining the city to each other like tourists, attending the Vertu Trophy final as a set piece for the documentary rather than a genuine sporting moment.

The production feels entirely **reverse-engineered from Wrexham's success**. Tom Wagner's speech to players after losing the final, clearly staged for cameras, lacks any authentic emotion. The attempt to replicate Wrexham's community focus falls flat because the ownership group shows no real understanding of or connection to Birmingham's culture. Where Wrexham's documentary enhanced the club's existing identity, Birmingham's feels like an attempt to impose an external narrative on an unwilling subject.

## 7. The Technology and Business Model

***"Netflix, Amazon, Disney Plus - they're world TV stations that can get this message over"***

The documentary boom is inseparable from the streaming revolution. Traditional broadcasters could never have justified the production costs or airtime for club-specific content, but **global streaming platforms** operate on different economics. They need constant content to maintain subscriptions, can amortize costs across worldwide audiences, and use sports documentaries to attract demographics that might not otherwise subscribe. The All or Nothing brand, primarily on Amazon Prime, can guarantee baseline viewership from club fans while hoping to attract neutral viewers through high production values and dramatic narratives.

**The financial model** works on multiple levels. Clubs receive production fees, gain global marketing reach, and can monetize new fans through merchandise and streaming subscriptions. Platforms get reliable content with built-in audiences. Production companies have steady work creating formulaic but profitable content. The only group not necessarily served by this arrangement is traditional fans, who find their clubs' stories sanitized and commercialized for global consumption.

## 8. The Future of Football Storytelling

***"Are fans engaging with football as a sport or is it a lifestyle that you live? There's an audience much bigger than those who watch games who are into all the stuff around football"***

The documentary phenomenon reflects a fundamental shift in how football is consumed. **The 24/7 content culture** means clubs must provide constant engagement beyond match days. Documentaries serve fans who consume football through clips, highlights, and personality-driven content rather than watching full matches. This audience, particularly younger and more global, may actually prefer documentaries to live games - finding the narrative structure and production values more engaging than 90 minutes of actual football.

The irony is that football's natural drama often surpasses anything scripted television could produce. Manchester United's penalty shootout against Grimsby, with Ruben Amorim unable to watch and his plastic tactics board becoming a viral sensation, provided more genuine entertainment than any documentary could manufacture. Yet the demand for documentary content continues growing because it serves different needs - **lifestyle engagement rather than sporting consumption**, parasocial relationships with players and managers, and the ability to feel connected to a club without watching every match. The future likely holds more branded content, more club-controlled narratives, and fewer genuine insights into football's reality.
