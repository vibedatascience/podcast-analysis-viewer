**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. Middle-Class Values and Early Life

***"Towards the end of the month, about the last week, my mother would say be careful - for four days you'll have to walk to school and you won't get bus fare."***

Vijay Lokapally's childhood in Delhi's Andhra Bhavan staff quarters during the 1960s shaped the journalist he would become. His father worked a government job where every rupee mattered, teaching young Vijay the value of money and hard work. The family lived modestly but richly in terms of values and experiences. His mother, a Maharashtrian woman who came from a village in Karnataka to Hyderabad, was a remarkable figure - a state award-winning painter and gifted singer who could have excelled in any field but channeled her talents into homemaking with extraordinary dedication.

The household operated on strict principles. When Vijay's father caught him smoking, the response wasn't punishment but a lesson in responsibility: "I will not stop you when you grow up, but do it when you earn, not from my pocket, not from the pocket money I give you." This approach to discipline - firm but respectful - became a template for how Vijay would later interact with cricketers and colleagues. The family's secular values were demonstrated dramatically when young Vijay came home from school repeating communal rhetoric. His father immediately took him to the local mosque and arranged for the Maulana to teach both Vijay and his sister about Islam and the Quran for fifteen days. This wasn't just about religious education; it was about building empathy and understanding across communities.

The Lokapally home was always full of guests, as relatives and friends from Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune would stay with them. Among these visitors was a particularly influential figure - the father of future cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle. This gentleman, a professor of French at Osmania University, would bring books as gifts on every visit, planting the seeds of Vijay's lifelong reading habit. The books ranged from history to biographies of great leaders like Shivaji, Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar. This early exposure to diverse literature and ideas would later inform Vijay's approach to cricket writing, where he understood that to truly know cricket, one must know much more than just cricket.

## 2. The 1969 Test Match - A Mother's Gift

***"My mother, from her savings, pulled out the money and told my dad that he has to watch the match."***

The story of Vijay's first cricket match encapsulates both the economic constraints of middle-class India and the sacrifices parents made for their children's dreams. In 1969, when Australia toured India, nine-year-old Vijay desperately wanted to watch the test match at Feroz Shah Kotla. The season ticket cost 16 rupees - a sum his father honestly admitted he couldn't afford. This wasn't dismissiveness; it was the reality of living on a fixed government salary where every expense had to be carefully managed.

When Vijay told his mother about his father's inability to buy the ticket, she made a decision that would change her son's life. From her personal savings - money she had carefully set aside from household management - she gave her husband the funds to purchase the ticket. But the story doesn't end there. Through a contact at a bank, Vijay's father managed to secure not just any ticket, but a season ticket, allowing young Vijay to attend all five days of the match.

This first experience of live cricket was transformative. Vijay had read about legendary players like Bill Lawry, Ian Chappell, and the Indian spin quartet of Erapalli Prasanna, Bishan Singh Bedi, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, and Venkataraghavan. But reading about cricket and watching it live were entirely different experiences. At the ground, he discovered fundamental aspects of the game he hadn't understood from reading - like the fact that teams bat from both ends. The visual reality of cricket - the field placements, the bowlers' run-ups, the batsmen's movements - created a three-dimensional understanding that no amount of reading could provide.

The match itself featured memorable performances, including Bishan Bedi taking 4 for 71 in the first innings and 5 for 37 in the second. Years later, when Bedi retired in 1981, Vijay would write a piece about him that Bedi himself would praise with a handwritten note - a beautiful synchronicity connecting that first match to his career as a cricket writer. His mother's sacrifice of 16 rupees had purchased not just a season ticket, but the foundation of a lifelong career.

## 3. The Importance of Watching Cricket

***"If you watch, you will learn. Not from television - you have to go to the ground, even if it's a local match, get the feel of it."***

One of the most crucial lessons in Vijay's career came from his senior colleague KP Mohan at The Hindu, who emphasized the fundamental principle of "watching and writing." This wasn't just about being physically present at matches; it was about truly observing the game with complete attention and understanding. Vijay developed an almost obsessive commitment to this principle - he never missed the first ball of any match he was covering, whether it was a test match or a domestic game. This became such a well-known habit that even players were aware of it. Once, when he had to sit away from the press box to accompany a friend, player Sanjay Bangar specifically asked him why he hadn't seen him at his usual spot, even though Vijay had been present from the first ball.

The practice of watching rather than relying on television or scorecards revealed layers of cricket invisible to casual observers. Field placements weren't random - they told stories about batsmen's weaknesses and bowlers' strategies. A captain bringing in a particular bowler from a specific end, or moving a fielder from square leg to long leg, contained tactical information that explained the flow of the game. These observations couldn't be gleaned from action replays or highlights; they required sustained attention to the entire canvas of the cricket field, not just the 22 yards where the ball was pitched.

Vijay noticed a disturbing trend when he visited press boxes in the 2000s - most journalists weren't watching the game at all. They sat with laptops or phones, looking up only when crowd noise indicated something significant had happened, then watching the television replay. This approach fundamentally misunderstood the nature of cricket journalism. The real story wasn't just in the wickets and boundaries, but in the accumulation of pressure, the subtle shifts in momentum, the body language of players, the changing conditions as the day progressed. A reporter who only watched replays was essentially covering a different game than the one being played.

The habit of watching extended beyond the playing area. Vijay would often step out of the air-conditioned press box to sit with spectators in the stands. This practice served multiple purposes. First, it kept him grounded and connected to how ordinary fans experienced the game. Second, he found that many spectators were extraordinarily knowledgeable, sometimes more so than journalists. He met fans who could predict tactical changes before they happened, who understood the game's rhythms with intuitive brilliance. One such spectator, Nithin from Delhi, could forecast which bowler would be brought on next or what field changes were imminent. These interactions enriched Vijay's understanding and reminded him that expertise existed outside professional circles.

## 4. The Pre-Digital Era of Cricket Journalism

***"I have spent so many hours - more hours in post offices trying to send the report than on the ground. Believe me, it used to be so bad."***

Cricket journalism in the 1980s and 1990s bore little resemblance to the digital age that followed. The challenge wasn't just writing a good report; it was getting that report to the newspaper office through whatever means available. Vijay's career spanned the evolution from telegrams to telex to fax to email, and each transition brought its own set of challenges and frustrations. In the early days, after watching a full day's play and writing his report by hand or on a typewriter, he would spend hours at post offices trying to send it via telegram or telex. The telex operators would often complain about the length or technical terminology, requiring patience and pleading to get the job done.

Fax machines, when they arrived, seemed like a blessing but came with their own problems. The quality of transmission depended entirely on telephone line quality, which varied wildly across India and internationally. During one tour to Kenya, Vijay and his colleague Visu Krishna spent so much of their daily allowance on faxing reports that they reached the airport for their return flight with only $30-35 left between them. The technology was unreliable enough that sometimes, after finishing a report, they would have to take a bus back to the office to file it in person. Vijay recalled reaching the office at 10:10 PM after such a journey, with anxious editors waiting.

The constraints of this era shaped writing in profound ways. Knowing that filing would take hours meant reports had to be written quickly and efficiently. There was no time for multiple drafts or extensive revisions. Writers developed the ability to compose clean copy in their heads before typing, minimizing corrections. Sunil Gavaskar's writing exemplified this discipline - his pieces would fill two full-scape sheets with half an inch margins at top and bottom, perfectly formatted with virtually no corrections. This wasn't just about neat handwriting; it reflected clarity of thought. Because he couldn't easily revise, Gavaskar had to think through his entire piece before putting pen to paper.

The pressure of deadlines and filing difficulties also created a different relationship with the craft. When Vijay covered two matches simultaneously during the 2003 World Cup India-Pakistan game, he had to prepare two complete reports - one for an India victory, one for a Pakistan victory - because the match's fluctuations made the outcome uncertain until the end. He worked with two windows open on his laptop, updating both versions as the game progressed. This kind of preparation and mental agility was essential in an era when you couldn't simply update a web story in real-time. Similarly, during the 1999 World Cup semi-final between Australia and South Africa, he prepared dual reports because the match's outcome remained uncertain until the final moments.

## 5. Access to Players and Understanding Cricket

***"I could watch a match, a competitive first-class match, sitting with Rahul Dravid who's going to bat next, and we were talking - it could be anything: cinema, cricket, books."***

The most significant difference between Vijay's era and contemporary cricket journalism was the extraordinary access reporters had to players. This wasn't just about getting quotes; it was about understanding cricket from the inside, seeing the game through the eyes of those who played it. Vijay traveled on team buses, had breakfast with umpires, lunch with players or substitutes, and spent evenings in long conversations about the game. This immersion provided insights impossible to gain from press conferences or brief interviews.

The access was so complete that it sometimes created ethical dilemmas. Once, while fetching water during a domestic match, Vijay witnessed a heated confrontation between Manoj Prabhakar and Maninder Singh in the dressing room. Prabhakar had gotten out to a turning ball and came back cursing about the "flat pitch," leading to a near-physical altercation. When Bishan Bedi, who was at the ground, heard about the incident and asked if Vijay would report it, Vijay declined. His reasoning was simple: he shouldn't have been in the dressing room in the first place. The incident wasn't meant for public consumption, and reporting it would have been a betrayal of the access he'd been granted.

This access allowed Vijay to understand the psychological dimensions of cricket that statistics and match reports couldn't capture. He learned about players struggling with form, dealing with personal problems that affected their game, or feeling pressure from selection uncertainties. When Virender Sehwag got out for 195 at Melbourne, going for a six when he was just five runs short of a double century, Vijay spoke with him immediately after. Sehwag was completely honest about his thought process, explaining why he went for the shot. These conversations revealed the human side of cricket - the hopes, fears, and split-second decisions that shaped careers.

The relationship between journalists and players was built on mutual respect and trust. Players knew which journalists could be trusted with sensitive information and which would sensationalize everything. Vijay developed a system where players would give him a missed call, and he would call them back when convenient. This arrangement, which continued even after his retirement, demonstrated the trust he'd built over decades. Players knew he wouldn't misquote them or betray confidences. When he wrote columns ghostwritten for players like Mohammad Azharuddin and Navjot Sidhu in Sportstar magazine, the conversations gave him deep insights into their thinking, some of which couldn't be published under their bylines but informed his broader understanding of the game.

## 6. Domestic Cricket as the Foundation

***"I was extremely fortunate that I did a lot of domestic cricket. I take pride in my domestic cricket coverage."***

While many journalists coveted international assignments, Vijay found his greatest satisfaction and learning in domestic cricket. This wasn't a consolation prize for missing bigger events; it was a deliberate choice that shaped his understanding of Indian cricket at its roots. Domestic cricket offered something international cricket couldn't - intimacy with the game and its players, freedom from the media circus, and the ability to watch cricket in its purest form without the overlay of nationalism and commercial pressure.

Traveling to domestic matches meant journeys on trains and buses to remote parts of India, staying in modest accommodations, and experiencing the country in ways that five-star international tours never allowed. These journeys themselves were educational. Vijay would deliberately travel by train even when his office provided airfare, because train travel gave him a feel for the places and people. He would get down at every platform, listen to local languages and dialects, observe how people interacted, and absorb the texture of different regions. This grounding in India's diversity informed his writing, giving it a richness that came from genuine understanding rather than superficial observation.

Domestic cricket also revealed the human stories behind the statistics. Players like KP Bhaskar, who came agonizingly close to playing for India multiple times but never quite made it, had stories as compelling as any international star. Bhaskar scored a double century in Mumbai and was told by the chairman of selectors that to get into the Indian dressing room, he'd need to score a triple century - a crushing response that exemplified the arbitrary nature of selection. Players like Ajit Wadekar, Surendra Bhave, Shivlal Yadav, and Gopal Bose were brilliant cricketers who played in the wrong era, competing against even better players for limited spots.

The ecosystem of domestic cricket was different from international cricket. Substitute players would let journalists eat lunch first because "you have to go watch the match." Umpires and scorers were accessible and willing to share insights. Coaches would sometimes ask Vijay's opinion on players or pitch conditions, valuing his judgment built on years of observation. This wasn't about journalists being more knowledgeable than cricket professionals; it was about the collaborative nature of domestic cricket, where everyone involved was working to understand and improve the game rather than managing media narratives and commercial interests.

## 7. Ethics and Integrity in Sports Journalism

***"If I had written about the dressing room incident, I would never have pardoned myself because I shouldn't have been there."***

Vijay's approach to journalism was shaped by both personal values inherited from his parents and professional standards instilled by The Hindu. His father's refusal to buy black market tickets for a movie, even when young Vijay threw a tantrum, taught him that principles mattered more than convenience. This lesson translated directly into his journalism - there were lines he wouldn't cross, even when crossing them might yield a sensational story.

The incident with Manoj Prabhakar and Maninder Singh exemplified this ethical framework. Despite witnessing a dramatic confrontation that would have made a compelling story, Vijay chose not to report it because he had no legitimate reason to be in the dressing room at that moment. He was there by accident, fetching water, and reporting what he'd seen would have been a betrayal of the access and trust that made his journalism possible. When Bishan Bedi asked if he would write about it, Vijay's refusal wasn't about protecting the players; it was about maintaining his own integrity.

The Hindu's editorial culture reinforced these values. When Vijay once used the word "pathetic" to describe a player's performance, his senior KP Mohan challenged him: "What was pathetic about it?" Mohan explained that the player might have been struggling with form or personal issues, and using such a strong word without understanding the context was unfair. After that conversation, Vijay never used the word "pathetic" in his reports again. This wasn't about being soft on players; it was about being fair and recognizing that cricket was hard, and failure didn't necessarily indicate lack of effort or character.

The ethical framework extended to how Vijay handled information given in confidence. Players would sometimes share personal struggles or team dynamics in private conversations. Vijay understood that this information was given in trust and couldn't be published without permission. When drunk or angry players said things they might regret, he would warn them that he was a journalist and they should be careful. On several occasions, he told players he was cutting certain quotes from interviews because publishing them would cause unnecessary trouble. This approach built trust that lasted decades - players knew they could speak honestly with him without fear of being sensationalized.

## 8. The Match-Fixing Scandal

***"The day the match-fixing episode happened, when I came back, I collected all the bats and threw them into the bin. I was so disheartened and disappointed."***

The match-fixing scandal of 2000 represented the darkest period in Indian cricket and a personal crisis for Vijay. Like many journalists, he had suspected something was wrong for years. Matches would be lost from winning positions in ways that defied logical explanation. There were whispers and rumors, but without concrete evidence, newspapers wouldn't publish allegations that could have serious legal consequences. The frustration of knowing something was wrong but being unable to report it was immense.

When the scandal finally broke through police investigations, Vijay's response was visceral and emotional. He had collected autographed bats from every tour he covered - a personal archive representing decades of relationships with cricketers. The day the match-fixing revelations became public, he gathered all these bats - approximately 40 of them - and threw them in the dustbin outside his house. This wasn't a rational decision; it was an expression of profound betrayal and disillusionment. Some of the names on those bats belonged to players he had known personally, players he had defended and supported, players who had betrayed not just the game but the trust of everyone who loved cricket.

The scandal changed cricket journalism fundamentally. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) established anti-corruption units, and suddenly the access that had been the foundation of good cricket journalism disappeared. Journalists could no longer casually visit dressing rooms or have informal conversations with players. Every interaction became monitored and controlled. While these measures were necessary to prevent future corruption, they also made it much harder to do the kind of deep, insightful journalism that required understanding players as human beings rather than just as quote-generating machines.

Vijay's personal relationships with players involved in the scandal were complicated. Some continued to deny their involvement even when evidence suggested otherwise. He lost respect for those players but, as a professional, still had to cover their cricket when they returned to the game. This created an internal conflict - how do you write fairly about someone you've lost respect for? The answer lay in separating the person from the performance, focusing on what happened on the field while acknowledging the shadow that would always hang over their careers.

## 9. The IPL Revolution and Changing Cricket Culture

***"Cricket culture has been harmed. I feel cricket culture has been harmed."***

The Indian Premier League, launched in 2008, transformed Indian cricket in ways both positive and negative. On the positive side, it brought unprecedented financial security to cricketers. Players who might have struggled financially throughout their careers suddenly had the opportunity to earn life-changing money in a few seasons. This was particularly important for domestic cricketers who never made it to the international level but were talented enough to succeed in T20 cricket. The IPL gave them financial dignity and recognition they would never have received otherwise.

However, the IPL also fundamentally altered what Vijay called "cricket culture" - the values, behaviors, and attitudes that had traditionally defined the game. The most visible change was in player behavior and expectations. Young cricketers who earned substantial IPL contracts developed a sense of entitlement that previous generations never had. They would miss practice sessions, make demands of franchises and state associations, and show less respect for coaches and senior players. The traditional hierarchy and discipline of cricket teams began to erode.

The change in cricket culture extended to how the game was perceived and played. Parents bringing children to coaching centers would explicitly request that their sons be trained as "IPL players" - meaning T20 specialists focused on aggressive batting and variations in bowling. The patient accumulation of runs, the art of building an innings, the craft of bowling long spells - these traditional skills became less valued. The very definition of success shifted from test cricket excellence to T20 marketability. This wasn't necessarily wrong, but it represented a fundamental reorientation of what cricket meant in Indian society.

The IPL also created a new class system within cricket. Players with IPL contracts lived in a different world from those without. They bought expensive apartments in gated communities where they didn't know their neighbors, losing the community connections that had kept previous generations grounded. Their social circles changed, often consisting only of other wealthy cricketers and celebrities. This isolation, combined with sudden wealth and fame, created psychological challenges that many young players weren't equipped to handle. Cases like Prithvi Shaw, a brilliantly talented player who went astray, illustrated the dangers of too much money and attention too soon.

## 10. Writing Beyond Match Reports

***"The features section would ask me to cover Jagjit Singh concerts or do interviews with Gulzar Sahab, and I did a book on films - 'Houseful' - where we wrote about 50 classics from the world of cinema."***

While cricket remained Vijay's primary focus, his writing extended far beyond match reports and player profiles. This versatility came partly from his own broad interests and partly from encouragement by editors who recognized his ability to write about diverse subjects. The Hindu's features section regularly assigned him to cover music concerts, interview filmmakers and artists, and review books. These assignments weren't distractions from his cricket work; they enriched it by developing different writing muscles and perspectives.

The inspiration for this versatility came from Raju Bharatan, a legendary journalist who wrote brilliantly about cricket, cinema, and music. Bharatan showed that a sports journalist didn't have to be narrowly specialized, that the skills of observation, analysis, and storytelling could be applied across domains. When Vijay started writing about cinema and music, Bharatan would critique his work, giving him scores like "six out of ten" or "seven out of ten" and explaining what could be improved. This mentorship helped Vijay develop a writing style that could adapt to different subjects while maintaining his distinctive voice.

One particularly interesting venture was "Table for Two," a food column where Vijay would take celebrities out for lunch or dinner and write about both the food and the conversation. This format allowed him to explore personalities in a relaxed setting, away from formal interviews. The challenge was to weave together descriptions of food, observations about the restaurant, and insights from the conversation into a coherent narrative. It required a different kind of attention than cricket writing - focusing on sensory details, social dynamics, and the rhythms of conversation rather than the technical aspects of sport.

Writing books presented yet another set of challenges. A book required sustained narrative over 50,000 words or more, demanding a different structure than daily journalism. When Vijay wrote his book on Virat Kohli, he interviewed approximately 100 of Kohli's teammates and associates, gathering material that would never fit in a newspaper article but was essential for a comprehensive portrait. The most difficult chapter was about the day Kohli came to the ground after his father's death - a story that had been reported in newspapers but needed deeper exploration for the book. This kind of writing required not just journalistic skills but empathy and literary sensibility.

## 11. Mentorship and Helping Young Journalists

***"When I help a kid, he in turn would help his junior after 10 years, and it has happened."***

One of the most consistent themes in Vijay's career was his commitment to helping young journalists. This wasn't occasional or grudging; it was a fundamental part of how he understood his role in the profession. The roots of this generosity lay in his own experience - he had been helped enormously by senior journalists like KP Mohan, who literally gave up cricket assignments so Vijay could have opportunities. Mohan's large-heartedness and lack of insecurity set an example that Vijay consciously emulated throughout his career.

The help Vijay provided took many forms. Sometimes it was as simple as connecting a young journalist with a player for an interview. He would call players on behalf of young reporters, vouching for them and asking the player to give them time. This was valuable not just because it got the interview, but because it taught young journalists how relationships worked in cricket journalism - that access was built on trust, and trust had to be earned over time. By lending his credibility to young journalists, Vijay helped them start building their own networks.

Other times, the mentorship was more substantive. Vijay would read young journalists' work and provide detailed feedback, pointing out what worked and what didn't. He would explain why certain approaches were effective and others weren't, sharing the accumulated wisdom of four decades in the profession. This wasn't about imposing his style on others; it was about helping them develop their own voices while avoiding common pitfalls. He understood that each generation faced different challenges and needed to find their own solutions, but that fundamental principles of good journalism remained constant.

The philosophy behind this mentorship was both practical and ethical. Practically, Vijay recognized that he had been fortunate - many contemporaries who were equally talented never got the opportunities he received. Helping young journalists was a way of paying forward the luck and support he'd enjoyed. Ethically, he believed that knowledge and experience should be shared, not hoarded. When a young journalist succeeded with his help, Vijay felt genuine joy, seeing in them the younger version of himself who had once needed guidance. This created a virtuous cycle - journalists he helped would later help others, spreading the culture of generosity and mentorship through the profession.

## 12. Relationships with Cricket Legends

***"I have done more than 50 Tendulkar interviews. He never said no."***

Vijay's relationships with cricket legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Bishan Singh Bedi, Kapil Dev, and Sunil Gavaskar were built on mutual respect and genuine friendship that transcended professional interactions. These weren't transactional relationships where a journalist extracted quotes from players; they were human connections based on shared love of cricket and years of interaction. The depth of these relationships gave Vijay insights into cricket and cricketers that couldn't be gained through formal interviews or press conferences.

The relationship with Bishan Singh Bedi began with Vijay's first test match in 1969 and deepened dramatically in 1981 when Bedi retired. Vijay, then a young journalist, wrote a piece about Bedi's retirement that captured the emotion and significance of the moment in ways that other reports didn't. Bedi was so moved that he wrote Vijay a handwritten note of appreciation - a gesture that meant everything to a young writer trying to establish himself. This began a friendship that lasted decades, with Bedi becoming a mentor who would call Vijay early in the morning with either encouragement ("daal puri" - meaning good work) or constructive criticism.

With Sachin Tendulkar, the relationship was characterized by Tendulkar's extraordinary humility despite his superstar status. Vijay witnessed this firsthand during a dinner in a Dutch palace when a local manager brought about 20 kids for autographs. Tendulkar accommodated them all patiently, then called the manager aside and explained that while he was happy to sign autographs, such interruptions should be arranged in advance so he could be prepared and give the kids proper attention. This incident revealed Tendulkar's thoughtfulness - he understood that refusing would disappoint the children, but he also wanted the manager to understand proper protocol.

Kapil Dev's relationship with Vijay was marked by Kapil's generosity and lack of ego. Despite being one of India's greatest cricketers and captains, Kapil never stood on ceremony or demanded special treatment. He was accessible, willing to discuss cricket in depth, and genuinely interested in Vijay's perspectives. Similarly, Sunil Gavaskar would engage Vijay in detailed cricket discussions, sometimes testing his knowledge with questions, not to embarrass him but to sharpen both their understandings of the game. These conversations were collaborative explorations of cricket rather than one-way interviews.

## 13. The Changing Nature of Cricket Journalism

***"Today there are 50 journalists on a tour where there used to be five. What does the BCCI do? They're also under pressure, but they're also guilty of not preparing the players in dealing with the media."***

The transformation of cricket journalism from Vijay's early career to his retirement represented a fundamental shift in how the sport was covered and understood. In the 1980s and early 1990s, a typical tour might have five journalists covering the Indian team. These journalists knew each other, knew the players, and operated in an environment of mutual trust and respect. By the 2000s, tours might have 50 journalists, creating a completely different dynamic where individual relationships became impossible and players had to protect themselves behind walls of PR management.

The proliferation of media created new pressures on both journalists and players. Journalists, facing intense competition, felt pressure to find "stories" - meaning controversies, conflicts, or sensational revelations - rather than simply covering cricket. Editors wanted headlines that would drive clicks and sales, not nuanced analysis of field placements or batting techniques. This led to a culture where journalists would hang around hotel lobbies or outside dressing rooms, hoping to catch players in unguarded moments or overhear something that could be turned into a story. This approach was antithetical to the relationship-based journalism Vijay practiced.

For players, the changed media environment meant constant vigilance. They couldn't relax in public spaces or speak freely even in supposedly private moments, because someone might be recording or taking notes. The anti-corruption measures implemented after the match-fixing scandal, while necessary, further restricted access. Players were advised to limit interactions with journalists, creating a barrier that made genuine understanding difficult. Press conferences became the primary mode of player-media interaction, but these were carefully managed events where players gave rehearsed answers to predictable questions, revealing little of substance.

The rise of television and digital media also changed what was expected of cricket journalists. When Vijay started his career, his match reports were the primary way most readers learned what happened in a game. By the 2000s, anyone interested in cricket had already watched the match on television or followed it online. The commodity of information - who scored how many runs, who took which wickets - was freely available. This should have pushed journalism toward deeper analysis and better storytelling, but often it pushed toward sensationalism instead, as outlets competed for attention in an oversaturated market.

## 14. Life After Retirement

***"I don't think I've retired. I'm still doing it, and it is good because when I still get press releases in my mailbox, it feels like I'm very active."***

Retirement from The Hindu in theory should have marked the end of Vijay's journalism career, but in practice it simply shifted the form his work took. His friend Nandini Rao Gupta, editor of Sportstar, immediately offered him a consultant position, ensuring he remained connected to the magazine and its young writers. This arrangement gave Vijay the best of both worlds - he was freed from the daily grind of match reporting and deadline pressure, but remained engaged with cricket journalism through long-form interviews, cover stories, and mentorship of younger colleagues.

The podcast became a particularly important outlet for Vijay's work. Unlike written journalism, which required editorial approval and fit within space constraints, podcasts allowed for extended conversations that could explore subjects in depth. His series of interviews with cricketers who never quite made it to the Indian team - players like KP Bhaskar, Surendra Bhave, and Ajit Wadekar - gave voice to stories that mainstream cricket coverage typically ignored. These were important stories, revealing the human cost of cricket's competitive pyramid where only a tiny fraction of talented players reach the top.

Retirement also allowed Vijay to pursue projects that wouldn't have been possible during his active career. He helped his son co-write a book on basketball, exploring a sport he'd always been interested in but never had time to cover professionally. He continued writing for Sportstar's website, contributing features that drew on his decades of experience and relationships. He remained involved in Sportstar's annual sports conclave and awards, helping organize events and connect younger journalists with cricket personalities.

Perhaps most importantly, retirement gave Vijay time to reflect on his career and the changes in cricket and journalism. He could see patterns and trends that weren't visible when he was caught up in daily reporting. He could articulate what had been lost in cricket's commercialization and what had been gained. He could mentor young journalists not just with practical advice but with a philosophical framework for understanding their role. His continued activity demonstrated that retirement didn't mean withdrawal; it meant a shift from doing to teaching, from reporting to reflecting, from individual achievement to collective contribution.

## 15. The Human Side of Cricket

***"You have to understand and accept that there are much more well-informed, intelligent people than you as far as reading of the game is concerned."***

Throughout his career, Vijay maintained a fundamental humility about his role and knowledge. Despite being one of India's most respected cricket journalists, he never claimed to know more than players, coaches, or even knowledgeable spectators. This humility wasn't false modesty; it was genuine recognition that cricket was complex and multifaceted, and that different people brought different kinds of expertise to understanding it. A player understood the game from inside in ways no journalist could. A coach saw tactical dimensions that might escape a reporter. A dedicated fan who watched every ball might notice patterns that a journalist juggling multiple responsibilities would miss.

This humility extended to how Vijay wrote about players. He understood that cricket was extraordinarily difficult, that even the best players failed more often than they succeeded, and that failure didn't necessarily indicate lack of effort or character. When a player got out to a poor shot, Vijay wouldn't automatically assume laziness or carelessness. He would consider whether the player was struggling with form, dealing with personal issues, facing particularly challenging bowling, or simply making a mistake in a game where mistakes were inevitable. This empathetic approach made his criticism, when it came, more credible because readers knew it wasn't reflexive or mean-spirited.

The human dimension of cricket was what ultimately interested Vijay most. Statistics and records were important, but they were just the surface. What mattered were the stories behind the statistics - the struggles, the sacrifices, the moments of doubt and triumph that shaped careers. A player like Mohinder Amarnath, who faced the world's fastest bowlers with courage and skill but never received the recognition he deserved, represented a more compelling story than many more celebrated cricketers. The domestic players who came agonizingly close to international selection but never quite made it had stories as rich as any test cricketer's.

This focus on the human side of cricket informed everything Vijay wrote. His match reports weren't just accounts of runs and wickets; they were narratives about people under pressure, making decisions with imperfect information, dealing with success and failure in public. His features explored the interior lives of cricketers - their fears, hopes, relationships, and the psychological challenges of performing at the highest level. His books attempted to capture the full complexity of individual cricketers, showing them as multidimensional human beings rather than one-dimensional heroes or villains. This approach made his journalism not just informative but meaningful, connecting cricket to the broader human experience of striving, failing, learning, and occasionally succeeding.
