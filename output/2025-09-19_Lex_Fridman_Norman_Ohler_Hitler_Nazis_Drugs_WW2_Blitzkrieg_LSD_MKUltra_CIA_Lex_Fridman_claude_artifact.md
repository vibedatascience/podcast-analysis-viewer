## 1. The Development of Methamphetamine in Nazi Germany

***"Pervitin was available in any pharmacy. You didn't need a prescription. A child could go and buy ten packs of pure methamphetamine."***

The story of methamphetamine in Nazi Germany begins with a fundamental contradiction in Nazi ideology. The Nazi movement, which positioned itself as anti-drug and focused on purity, became one of history's most significant state-sponsored drug distribution operations. This paradox emerged from the cultural landscape of 1920s Germany, where two distinct drug cultures existed: Munich's beer-drinking Nazi movement centered in Bavarian beer halls, and Berlin's experimental drug scene featuring morphine, cocaine, and ether use among diverse populations.

The Temmler pharmaceutical company in Berlin developed Pervitin (methamphetamine) in the late 1930s, motivated partly by the 1936 Olympics where Jesse Owens's victories suggested to German observers that American athletes might be using performance enhancers like Benzedrine. The company's head chemist, Fritz Hauschild, synthesized methamphetamine based on a 1917 Japanese formula. The resulting product was marketed as a performance enhancer rather than a drug, similar to how coffee is perceived today. This framing allowed it to bypass the Nazi regime's anti-drug stance.

Pervitin became widely available without prescription and was remarkably cheap, making it accessible to all segments of German society. The drug was not initially stigmatized because it was presented as a legitimate pharmaceutical product from a reputable German company. University studies at the time focused on its positive effects—reduced fear, decreased need for sleep, suppressed appetite—all qualities that would prove valuable for military applications. The negative effects of methamphetamine, including addiction and tolerance, only became publicly discussed starting in 1940 when critics began questioning its compatibility with Nazi ideology.

## 2. Professor Ranke and the Militarization of Methamphetamine

***"Ranke was employed by the army. It was his job to find things that would improve the performance of the German soldier. He was like a James Bond character like Q who developed gadgets."***

Professor Otto Ranke served as head of the Institute for Army Physiology, tasked with enhancing soldier performance. His primary challenge was combating fatigue, which he identified as the German soldier's main opponent—not enemy forces. When Ranke encountered university reports about Pervitin's effects, he recognized its military potential immediately. He conducted his own experiments at military academies, testing young medical officers with methamphetamine, caffeine, benzedrine, and placebos in controlled settings.

These experiments consistently demonstrated methamphetamine's superiority. In one notable test beginning at 8 PM, subjects on Pervitin remained energetic and wanted to party at 10 AM the following morning, while those on caffeine were sleeping on benches. Despite these compelling results, Ranke initially faced resistance from the army's surgeon general, an old-school military doctor who didn't understand or trust synthetic drugs.

The turning point came with the Polish campaign in 1939. Although Germany attacked Poland without official methamphetamine regulations, many soldiers brought Pervitin with them. Ranke requested field reports from medical officers about Pervitin use and its effects. The overwhelmingly positive feedback convinced him that methamphetamine was an effective combat drug. This data became crucial when Hitler began planning the Western offensive, which would require unprecedented endurance from German forces.

Ranke's transformation from outsider to essential military figure occurred when the strategic plan to invade France through the Ardennes mountains was approved. This plan required reaching the French border city of Sedan within three days and three nights of continuous movement—an impossible feat without a method to eliminate sleep. Suddenly, Ranke's methamphetamine research became critically important. He delivered lectures to officers and authored a "stimulant decree" that prescribed methamphetamine dosages and intervals for an entire army—an unprecedented pharmaceutical military operation.

## 3. The French Campaign and Blitzkrieg Strategy

***"On May 10th they took their methamphetamine and they started the surprise attack through the Arden mountains."***

The German invasion of France represented a revolutionary moment in military history, combining innovative tactical thinking with pharmaceutical enhancement. Three young tank generals—Rommel, von Manstein, and Guderian—presented Hitler with a bold plan that contradicted conventional military wisdom. Instead of attacking through northern Belgium (repeating World War I's approach), they proposed driving the entire German army through the Ardennes mountains, a route considered impassable for large-scale military operations.

The genius of this plan lay in reimagining tank warfare. Rather than using tanks as slow support vehicles in the rear, these generals envisioned tanks as the spearhead—racing forward like cars, overpowering the enemy through speed and surprise. The French and British forces, positioned in northern Belgium and along the Maginot Line, would be caught completely off-guard. However, this strategy's success depended entirely on reaching Sedan within 72 hours of continuous movement, which meant soldiers could not stop for rest.

This operational requirement made Ranke's methamphetamine research suddenly indispensable. Temmler had to deliver 35 million dosages to the front lines. The distribution was strategic rather than uniform—tank troops leading the advance received the most methamphetamine because they needed it most. Rommel's division, in particular, used extraordinary amounts, earning him the nickname "the crystal fox" in Ohler's research.

The campaign's execution revealed methamphetamine's psychological effects beyond mere wakefulness. Soldiers reported feeling euphoric, confident, and energized. The drug created what could be described as a "party mood" even in combat situations. This altered state contributed to aggressive, relentless tactics. Rommel, for instance, drove his tanks through French villages at night while enemy soldiers slept (having consumed their regulation three-quarters liter of red wine per day). His tank treads became bloody from running over sleeping French soldiers—a war crime that marked the Wehrmacht's loss of innocence.

The French campaign succeeded spectacularly, with France falling in just six weeks. However, this success was not solely attributable to methamphetamine. The strategic brilliance of the Ardennes plan, the element of surprise, superior German tank tactics, and French military unpreparedness all contributed significantly. Methamphetamine enabled the execution of an already brilliant strategy by solving the specific problem of sustained wakefulness during the critical 72-hour push.

## 4. The Dunkirk Mistake and Hitler's First Major Blunder

***"Hitler stops the tanks. It's this famous halt order. They were all on meth, they didn't want to stop. But Hitler was not on meth."***

The Dunkirk decision represents one of World War II's most consequential moments and illustrates how Hitler's disconnect from his methamphetamine-fueled generals led to strategic disaster. After the successful sickle cut through the Ardennes, German forces had effectively trapped the entire British Expeditionary Force and significant French forces against the English Channel. Only the port of Dunkirk remained open for potential evacuation.

German tank forces, still operating on methamphetamine and momentum, were positioned to close this final escape route. Victory seemed certain—capturing or destroying the British military would have fundamentally altered the war's trajectory. However, Hitler issued his infamous "halt order," stopping the tank advance just as they reached Dunkirk's outskirts.

This decision stemmed from multiple factors rooted in Hitler's cognitive disconnect from the new warfare his generals were waging. Hitler remained mentally anchored in World War I tactics, concerned about exposed flanks and conventional military vulnerabilities. The tank generals, operating in a methamphetamine-enhanced state and pioneering blitzkrieg warfare, were fighting World War II while Hitler was still fighting World War I. He couldn't comprehend the speed and fluidity of the new mobile warfare.

Hermann Göring, Hitler's morphine-addicted Luftwaffe commander, exploited this moment of uncertainty. Göring convinced Hitler that allowing the army to complete the victory would give army high command too much power and influence over future war strategy. Instead, Göring promised that his National Socialist Luftwaffe would destroy the British forces from the air, ensuring the Nazi Party's dominance over the traditional military establishment.

This decision proved catastrophic. The Luftwaffe could not accomplish from the air what ground forces could have achieved in hours. The British successfully evacuated over 300,000 troops from Dunkirk's beaches, preserving their army to fight another day. Von Manstein, one of the original architects of the Ardennes strategy, later called this a "lost victory"—Germany could have achieved complete dominance over Britain but squandered the opportunity due to Hitler's fear of his own generals' success and Göring's morphine-influenced grandiosity.

## 5. Dr. Theodor Morell and Hitler's Drug Dependency

***"Morell was this good-natured Dr. Feel Good in the beginning, and then when Ukraine was occupied, he became this business freak who made a lot of money with his dubious hormonal concoctions."***

Dr. Theodor Morell entered Hitler's life in 1936 as a celebrity doctor operating a fashionable practice on Berlin's Kurfürstendamm. Morell represented a new type of physician—a "Dr. Feelgood" who treated patients not for diseases but to enhance their performance and well-being. His clientele included opera stars and performers who received injections before important performances. Morell was innovative, knowledgeable about cutting-edge treatments including hormones and probiotics, but lacked ethical boundaries about what he would prescribe.

Morell's physical appearance worked against him—he was overweight with poor eating habits and an unappealing demeanor that disgusted many who met him. However, this very unattractiveness made him non-threatening to Hitler, who was paranoid about appearing vulnerable before impressive medical professionals. Hitler never undressed before doctors and maintained strict control over what others knew about his body. Morell's harmlessness and willingness to do exactly what Hitler wanted made him the perfect personal physician.

Their relationship began when Hitler's photographer, Hoffmann, introduced them at a dinner in Munich. Hitler complained about severe stomach problems—he was a "cake vegetarian" who ate sweets and white bread but avoided healthy foods, resulting in constant bloating and painful gas. Morell introduced Hitler to Mutaflor, a probiotic medication containing bacteria cultured from a German WWI soldier who hadn't contracted stomach flu in Serbia. This treatment successfully resolved Hitler's digestive issues, convincing Hitler that Morell was a "wonder doctor."

From 1936 to 1941, Morell's treatments remained relatively benign—primarily vitamin injections and glucose. Hitler became psychologically dependent on the daily injection ritual itself, feeling that each day was good once he received his shot. He remained healthy, energetic, and capable of standing with his arm raised for hours during military parades (he trained with an expander specifically for this purpose). This phase represented Hitler as a high-functioning leader making generally sound military decisions.

The critical transformation occurred in August 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. Hitler fell severely ill with what was called "Russian flu"—high fever and debilitating symptoms—just as crucial decisions about the Soviet campaign needed to be made. Vitamins were insufficient. Morell made the fateful decision to inject Hitler intravenously with Eukodal (oxycodone), a powerful opioid. The effect was immediate and profound—Hitler felt fantastic, attended the military briefing, dominated the room, and made the controversial decision to split German forces toward Leningrad and the oil fields rather than concentrating on Moscow.

This Eukodal injection opened a new chapter in Hitler's drug use. He had discovered a substance that made him feel supremely confident, clear-minded, and energetic for hours. From Hitler's perspective, this wasn't drug addiction—it was medical treatment that enabled him to function at peak performance. The psychological and physical effects of opioids—the sense of well-being, pain relief, mental clarity, and confidence—made Eukodal extremely attractive to someone under immense stress making life-and-death decisions daily.

## 6. The Expansion of Hitler's Drug Cocktail

***"From 1941 to 1943, he tries out a lot of medications that he didn't try out before. He becomes experimental."***

After discovering Eukodal's effects, Hitler's pharmaceutical regimen expanded dramatically. Morell, who had established his own pharmaceutical company (Hamma Pharmaceuticals) with production facilities in occupied Czechoslovakia, began developing and testing various experimental treatments on Hitler. This arrangement created a disturbing feedback loop: Morell would manufacture medications, Hitler would test them, and if Hitler approved, Morell could decree them legal for military use throughout Germany.

Morell's pharmaceutical ambitions grew increasingly exploitative. When Germany occupied Ukraine, he requested a monopoly on all organs from all slaughtered animals in Ukrainian slaughterhouses. This massive logistical operation—transporting animal organs in military trains back to Czechoslovakia while wounded German soldiers needed those same trains—demonstrated Morell's transformation from physician to war profiteer. He used these organs to create hormonal extracts, including pig liver preparations that Hitler tested and approved.

The variety of substances Hitler received expanded to include bull testicle extracts, various hormonal concoctions, and increasingly frequent opioid injections. Morell kept meticulous notes documenting every injection, dosage, and Hitler's reactions—records that proved invaluable for historical research. These documents, stored in German federal archives but largely ignored by historians until Ohler's research, reveal the progression of Hitler's pharmaceutical dependency.

A crucial addition came after the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt by Stauffenberg. A bomb exploded during a military briefing, killing several people but sparing Hitler largely because a heavy oak table shielded him from the blast. However, Hitler sustained significant injuries including blown eardrums, over 100 wooden splinters throughout his body, internal bleeding, and severe shell shock. Nazi propaganda claimed Hitler was miraculously unharmed, but medical reality told a different story.

Dr. Erwin Giesing, an ear-nose-throat specialist, was summoned to treat Hitler's damaged eardrums. Giesing used cocaine as a topical anesthetic—standard medical practice at the time. Hitler immediately appreciated cocaine's effects: the rush of confidence, the sense of superiority, the feeling of mental clarity. He began requesting cocaine applications not just for his ears but also nasally. Giesing's detailed 15-page report to American military interrogators after the war describes Hitler's enthusiasm for cocaine and how it temporarily stabilized him after the assassination attempt's psychological trauma.

The combination of Eukodal (opioid) and cocaine created what's known as a "speedball"—mixing a stimulant and depressant for an intense, unstable high. This is considered one of the most hardcore drug combinations, typically used only by people in advanced stages of addiction. Hitler was receiving this combination regularly by summer 1944: Morell would give him Eukodal intravenously, then Giesing would apply cocaine. This pharmaceutical cocktail coincided with Hitler's increasingly erratic decision-making and physical deterioration.

## 7. The Doctor's War and Hitler's Final Months

***"Giesing teamed up with Himmler and basically said to Himmler, this Morell guy is making the Führer addicted to opioids."***

By 1944, a power struggle erupted between Morell and Giesing over access to and influence over Hitler. Giesing, whether motivated by genuine medical concern or personal ambition, recognized that Hitler had become a "drug wreck" dependent on multiple substances. He observed Hitler's physical deterioration: trembling, premature aging, and the toll of Morell's experimental treatments which may have caused autoimmune diseases and possibly Parkinson's symptoms.

Giesing allied with Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, who was already suspicious of Morell's unchecked access to Hitler. Himmler, a control-obsessed figure, had no oversight of what medications Morell administered during their private sessions. Giesing presented evidence of Hitler's pharmaceutical dependency, arguing that Morell was harming rather than helping the Führer. This led to a confrontation—what Ohler calls the "high noon" between the two doctors.

The situation reached crisis point in Hitler's bunker during the final months of the war. Two bedrooms existed in the Berlin bunker: one for Hitler, the other for Morell—a testament to Morell's importance. However, a critical problem emerged: Eukodal became unavailable. British bombers had destroyed the Merck pharmaceutical factory in December 1944, eliminating production of Hitler's primary opioid. Morell desperately searched Berlin's bombed-out pharmacies, riding a motorcycle from location to location trying to score Eukodal, but couldn't find any.

Hitler entered opioid withdrawal—shaking, feeling terrible, unable to function. This physical dependency made undeniable what had been happening: Hitler had become a drug addict. Joseph Goebbels, who understood the situation, wanted Morell's bedroom in the bunker and used this crisis to turn Hitler against his doctor. In late April 1945, Hitler finally realized what Morell had done to him. According to some reports, Hitler held a gun to Morell's head, forcing him to kneel while accusing him of causing addiction. Hitler fired Morell, who left the bunker in tears.

Morell caught one of the last planes out of Berlin on May 2, 1945, fleeing to his research laboratory in Bavaria near Berchtesgaden. In a bizarre display of either insanity or German fastidiousness, Morell began doing his taxes—perhaps the only task he could think of while his world collapsed. American forces captured him shortly after, interrogating him extensively about Hitler's medical treatment. Morell spent two years in American military custody before being released in 1947 in poor health. A half-Jewish nurse found him collapsed outside Munich's train station, wearing an ill-fitting American uniform jacket. His wife came from Berlin for a final meeting in a hospital by Lake Tegernsee, where Morell died—an ignominious end for the man who had been closer to Hitler than perhaps anyone else.

## 8. The Bohemians: Berlin's Resistance Network

***"Harro Schulze-Boysen formed together with his wife Libertas the largest resistance network against the Nazis that ever existed—over a hundred people in Berlin."***

The story of Harro Schulze-Boysen and Libertas provides a counterpoint to the Nazi drug narrative—showing Germans who actively resisted rather than participated in the regime. Ohler discovered Harro's story by accident while researching Luftwaffe drug use in Munich archives. He found a final letter Harro wrote to his father before execution, expressing no regrets about his resistance activities and maintaining a clear conscience about trying to stop "this madness."

Harro came from an influential bourgeois German family—his great-grand-uncle was Admiral von Tirpitz who built the Kaiser's navy. The family represented patriotic, democratic, militaristic Germans rather than Nazis. In the Weimar Republic, Harro published a newspaper called "Der Gegner" (The Opponent), which featured diverse viewpoints and encouraged democratic discourse. He believed people could reach agreement through discussion—a fundamentally democratic or libertarian philosophy.

This idealism shattered in April 1933, two months after Hitler took power. The SS raided Der Gegner's editorial meeting, beat everyone present, destroyed typewriters and printing presses, and took Harro and his half-Jewish best friend to an early concentration camp. They tortured both men; the friend, Henry Erlanger, was killed. Harro survived but bore permanent scars—including swastikas carved into his thighs with knives. This experience taught him the brutal reality of who he opposed and transformed him into an active resistance fighter.

Harro adopted what 1960s activists would later call "the long march through the institutions"—infiltrating the system to change it from within rather than fleeing Germany. He joined the Luftwaffe and worked his way up in the Air Ministry, a massive building on Wilhelmstrasse that served as a Nazi power center. His position gave him access to sensitive military information, including Germany's clandestine support for Franco's fascists in the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Harro attempted to pass this information to the BBC through a journalist he met at the Berlin Olympics, but the journalist was too frightened to publish it.

Libertas came from aristocratic stock, living in a castle north of Berlin. Her family had unusual history—her grandfather had been in a relationship with the German Emperor, who was apparently bisexual and held homosexual meetings at the castle. Libertas worked as a press representative for MGM's Berlin office, promoting Hollywood films in Germany's major movie market. She was initially a Nazi Party member, though not particularly active—representing the "normal German girl" who hadn't yet questioned the regime.

Harro and Libertas met in 1934 while boating—he was rowing, she was on a sailboat. They fell in love immediately. That first night, Harro refused to undress despite warm weather because he didn't want Libertas to see his torture scars. When she eventually discovered them, she began understanding the regime's true nature. Their relationship became the foundation of Berlin's largest resistance network.

## 9. The Bohemians' Methods and Downfall

***"They organized this resistance group through parties. They were like a power couple of Berlin and they had a great loft apartment where they had parties every second Thursday night."***

The Bohemians' recruitment strategy was ingenious and difficult for the Gestapo to penetrate. Harro and Libertas hosted parties every second Thursday in their large loft apartment off Kurfürstendamm. These gatherings featured music, dancing, drinking, and sex—embodying the "free love" philosophy that if you're against fascism, you should be for freedom in all aspects of life. This wasn't dogmatic; some members like a female doctor found the sexual openness too complicated and potentially compromising for operations.

The parties served as recruitment venues. Harro and Libertas would invite friends and carefully test them by making critical comments about the regime. If someone responded positively, they'd gradually reveal more. If someone seemed uncomfortable or changed the subject, they'd back off. This personal, trust-based approach made infiltration extremely difficult. The Gestapo excelled at penetrating communist resistance groups by having agents simply espouse communist ideology, but the Bohemians' social, personal nature required genuine relationships that couldn't be easily faked.

The network grew to over 100 people from diverse backgrounds: artists, workers, leftists, patriots. This diversity reflected Harro's belief that people of different views could unite against fascism. The group engaged in various resistance activities, including a spectacular propaganda action in May 1942. They created stickers reading "The Nazi Paradise: Torture, SS Torture, Hunger, War—How Long Will It Last?" and plastered over 1,000 throughout Berlin at night. They worked in pairs—a man and woman would pretend to kiss against a wall while one applied the sticker, then move on. The next morning, tens of thousands of Berliners saw evidence that resistance existed.

The network's downfall came through Soviet intelligence. Harro had been passing military information to both Western Allies and the Soviet Union, going beyond passive resistance to active intelligence work. The Soviets provided a radio transmitter for sending information to Moscow, though the Bohemians struggled with the Russian-only instructions. The fatal mistake came when Moscow sent a response message that the Nazis intercepted and decoded. Incredibly, this message contained Harro's real name and address—either a catastrophic intelligence blunder or deliberate betrayal by Stalin's paranoid regime.

The Gestapo began surveillance, observing the network for months before arresting members. During Libertas's custody, the Gestapo used a secretary named Gertrud Breiter to pose as a sympathetic friend. Libertas, desperate for human connection, confided in this false friend, providing information that helped destroy the network. Harro and Libertas were tried in military court, sentenced to death, and executed. Harro's final letter to his father expressed no regrets, maintaining he had done what he could to stop the madness with a clear conscience.

## 10. The Origins and Development of LSD

***"The Swiss CEO had learned biochemistry from the Jewish German god of biochemistry, Willstätter. And there was another guy learning from Willstätter: Kuhn. So it was Kuhn and Stoll—those were the two students."***

The LSD story begins with an intellectual lineage connecting Swiss pharmaceutical innovation to Nazi biochemistry. Richard Willstätter, a Nobel Prize-winning Jewish German biochemist, pioneered extracting potent alkaloids from so-called poisonous plants, understanding that "the dosage makes the poison"—a substance toxic in large amounts might be medicinal in small doses. Two of his students took divergent paths: Arthur Stoll became CEO of Sandoz pharmaceutical company in Basel, Switzerland, while Richard Kuhn became Hitler's leading biochemist, working on truth drugs and nerve gas.

Despite their political opposition, Stoll and Kuhn maintained friendship and scientific collaboration through the 1930s. They communicated extensively about ergot research—ergot being a fungus growing on rye that contains powerful alkaloids. In 1943, Sandoz chemist Albert Hofmann synthesized LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) from ergot, discovering its effects accidentally through skin absorption. This discovery occurred in neutral Switzerland, literally a stone's throw from the German border, while World War II raged across Europe.

Sandoz faced the question: what is LSD good for? They created an "intoxication room" within the company where employees could voluntarily take LSD in comfortable settings. These first human subjects—ordinary pharmaceutical workers—reported universally positive experiences: uncontrollable laughter, profound well-being, life revelations, heightened sensitivity. CEO Stoll, trained in Willstätter's methods, recognized potential for treating mental health conditions. This was before antidepressants or antipsychotics existed, and World War II had created millions of traumatized people needing treatment.

However, the Nazi connection emerged through the Kuhn-Stoll relationship. Ohler discovered in Sandoz archives (now owned by Novartis) correspondence showing that in October 1943, Kuhn acknowledged receiving half a gram of ergotamine (LSD's precursor) from Stoll. Combined with evidence from Dachau concentration camp archives showing SS experiments with mescaline and an unnamed hallucinogenic substance, this strongly suggests Nazis used LSD alongside mescaline in human experiments.

The truth drug concept drove this research. The ideal truth drug would be odorless, tasteless, and undetectable—allowing administration without the subject's knowledge. After 30-60 minutes, the drug would create mental uncertainty that interrogators could exploit to extract secrets. Mescaline had the right effects but tasted bitter and was difficult to produce. LSD was odorless, tasteless, relatively easy to synthesize, and profoundly psychoactive—seemingly perfect for this purpose.

## 11. From Nazi Experiments to CIA's MK-Ultra

***"When the Americans liberated the Dachau camp, they had a special unit called Alsos with them. Alsos's job was to find German scientists and interview them, get their knowledge for the nuclear program mostly but also for biochemical weapons."***

The transition of LSD from Nazi experiments to American intelligence operations represents one of history's darkest continuities. When American forces liberated Dachau, the Alsos mission immediately interrogated Richard Kuhn about German scientific advances. Kuhn, an opportunist rather than ideological Nazi, eagerly collaborated to avoid the Nuremberg trials and continue his career. He immediately told Americans about LSD.

The next day, a high-ranking American general flew from the United States to Frankfurt, met with Kuhn in Heidelberg, then traveled in civilian clothes to neutral Basel (removing his uniform to respect Swiss neutrality) and obtained the first LSD samples from Stoll. This was summer 1945—the war barely over, and already LSD was in American military hands. The U.S. military began examining whether LSD could be the truth drug the Nazis had sought.

In 1947, the newly formed CIA (America previously had no central intelligence agency) took over LSD research. Director Allen Dulles declared that "brain warfare" between the Soviet Union and United States required preparedness against potential Soviet mind control techniques. Whether genuinely afraid or using fear as justification, the CIA claimed they needed to develop truth drugs before the Soviets did. This launched MK-Ultra, the infamous mind control program where LSD played a central role.

MK-Ultra represented a continuation of Nazi human experimentation—deeply illegal, never approved by Congress, profoundly unethical, and fundamentally un-American. The program conducted experiments on unwitting subjects, including prisoners, mental patients, and even CIA employees. One of these guinea pigs was Ken Kesey, who received $75 to take LSD for the CIA while working in a Menlo Park psychiatric ward. This experience inspired "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"—Kesey's LSD-fueled revelation that psychiatric patients weren't crazy but simply saw the world differently, understanding that neuroplasticity leads away from singular thinking toward recognizing multiple valid perspectives.

Sydney Gottlieb, MK-Ultra's director, wanted to control LSD completely—not because he thought it dangerous, but because he wanted it exclusively for CIA experiments. He couldn't prevent legitimate academic LSD research (which continued until 1966 prohibition), but he could pressure Sandoz. In a crucial meeting, Gottlieb arrived at Stoll's Basel office with a suitcase containing $240,000 to purchase the world's LSD supply. The American ambassador had reported that Sandoz had produced 400 kilograms; Stoll corrected this to 400 grams but agreed to sell everything.

The pressure was clear: if Sandoz wanted FDA approval for other medications in America (the world's largest pharmaceutical market), LSD couldn't be one of those products. Stoll betrayed LSD, agreeing it would only be distributed as a research drug. Researchers could request it from Sandoz for legitimate studies, but most LSD went to the CIA for MK-Ultra experiments. However, LSD inevitably "spilled out" from these programs into broader culture, eventually fueling the 1960s counterculture movement.

## 12. LSD's Effects and Therapeutic Potential

***"LSD is the more sophisticated molecule. It docks onto more receptors than psilocybin—psilocybin interacts with like five different types of receptors in the brain and LSD like with nine."***

Understanding LSD's effects requires examining both neuroscience and subjective experience. A neuroscientist from University Hospital Zurich who has researched psychedelics since the early 1990s explained that LSD is molecularly more sophisticated than psilocybin. While psilocybin interacts with approximately five receptor types, LSD interacts with nine, making it a more complex key fitting more precisely into brain locks. This explains why LSD works in microgram doses (the only substance besides the strongest snake venoms to be active at such tiny amounts) while psilocybin requires milligram doses.

The fundamental mechanism involves reducing energy to the default mode network—the brain's command center that maintains conditioned perceptions and habitual thinking patterns. When this network receives less energy, other brain regions communicate more freely, creating neuroplasticity. This doesn't mean users become more knowledgeable automatically, but they can perceive differently, potentially understanding aspects of their lives or reality previously obscured by conditioned thinking.

Dosage dramatically affects experience. A microdose (10 micrograms) feels like a pleasant espresso lasting 2-3 hours with no visual effects. At 50 micrograms, colors intensify slightly. The "trip" begins around 100 micrograms, with significant effects at 200+ micrograms. Duration is considerable—typically 8-10 hours compared to psilocybin's 5 hours. LSD is described as more intense and potentially overwhelming than psilocybin's "softer" experience.

Ohler's first LSD experience in 1993 Manhattan illustrates the drug's power and potential danger. Given a tab by his girlfriend Ana, he initially felt nothing for an hour. Then, in a bathroom, he noticed painted lines on walls beginning to vibrate—the trip's onset. What followed was terrifying: his friend Dora appeared tiny, he witnessed what seemed like a gang killing (possibly hallucinated), and saw a full-blown racial riot on Second Avenue. He thought he'd permanently damaged his brain and gone insane. However, after 10 hours, effects wore off and he returned to normal, ultimately viewing it as valuable despite being frightening.

The experience revealed fundamental truths: everything in the universe is moving (atoms aren't rigid), conditioned perception is just one way of seeing, and reality is far more fluid than everyday consciousness suggests. This freeing realization—that the world is "very different depending on how you look at it"—represents LSD's core value. Subsequent trips at lower doses never matched that first experience's intensity, possibly because the brain reacts most strongly to its first encounter with such profound neuroplasticity.

Therapeutic applications are emerging from renewed research. Studies show LSD microdoses may help Alzheimer's disease—significant because Alzheimer's destroys the same 5-HT2A receptors that LSD stimulates. Ohler's mother, who has Alzheimer's, showed remarkable improvement on mushroom microdoses, picking up a newspaper and reading headlines for the first time in a year. This personal experience motivated Ohler's research into LSD's history, resulting in the book "Tripped" where he traces why such a potentially beneficial substance became illegal.

## 13. The Prohibition of LSD and Its Consequences

***"Sydney Gottlieb really didn't want LSD to be on the market. He wanted to control LSD. He wanted LSD to be his so he could use it for MK-Ultra experiments."***

LSD's prohibition stemmed not from scientific evidence of harm but from CIA's desire for exclusive control and subsequent cultural panic. The drug never received the chance to be properly evaluated as a therapeutic medication because Gottlieb's MK-Ultra program required keeping it restricted. Sandoz CEO Stoll, despite wanting to market LSD, succumbed to pressure from the CIA and FDA (which had close relationships at the time). The implicit threat was clear: cooperate on LSD restriction or face difficulties getting other Sandoz medications approved for the lucrative American market.

This created a tragic irony: a substance that showed promise for treating trauma, depression, and other mental health conditions became illegal precisely because it was so interesting to intelligence agencies. Legitimate academic research continued until 1966, producing valuable findings about LSD's effects on consciousness, creativity, and mental health. However, the decisive factor in prohibition was cultural rather than scientific.

The 1960s counterculture embraced LSD enthusiastically, partly because it had "spilled out" from CIA experiments through figures like Ken Kesey. The hippie movement's association with LSD—combined with the drug's profound consciousness-altering effects that challenged authority and conventional thinking—made it politically threatening. A substance that increases empathy, reduces fear, enhances neuroplasticity, and makes users question conditioned beliefs is inherently dangerous to authoritarian structures.

The prohibition in 1966 effectively ended research for decades, creating a "dark age" of psychedelic science. Only in recent years has research resumed, revealing what was lost: potential treatments for PTSD, depression, addiction, end-of-life anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. The decades-long prohibition represented a massive setback for mental health treatment, driven by intelligence agency control desires and cultural panic rather than scientific evidence.

Ohler's research revealed another layer: Germany's beer purity law (Reinheitsgebot), long celebrated as quality control, was actually the first prohibitionist drug law in medieval Europe. The Catholic Church mandated that beer could only contain water, hops, and barley, eliminating nightshade plants and other psychoactive ingredients that "witches" had been brewing into visionary beers. People would drink these beers, have visions, and dance around fires—exactly what the Church wanted to suppress. The purity law wasn't about quality; it was about control.

## 14. Psychedelics and Human Evolution

***"I think Moses was actually having a trip. He was hallucinating. The burning bush was—if you take LSD and you look at a bush in the heat, it will move. It might resemble a burning experience."***

The connection between psychedelics and human consciousness evolution forms the foundation of Ohler's next book, "Stoned Sapiens." This work examines human history through the lens of drug use, arguing that psychoactive substances played a crucial role in developing human consciousness and civilization. The thesis challenges conventional historical narratives that ignore or minimize drugs' importance in human development.

The story begins approximately 1.5 million years ago with Homo erectus in the Great Rift Valley, where the plant khat (a natural amphetamine) grew abundantly. While no direct evidence proves Homo erectus used khat, they lived in its habitat and the plant was there. Homo erectus achieved remarkable evolutionary advances: shedding fur to develop sweat glands (enabling sustained running that exhausted prey animals who had to stop panting), developing jogging as a hunting strategy, and eventually giving rise to Homo sapiens.

Homo sapiens faced near-extinction at one point, with only about 1,500 individuals remaining. Inbreeding threatened the species. The development of consciousness—the ability to think abstractly, plan, imagine, and create—saved humanity from extinction. But how did this consciousness develop? Conventional explanations remain vague. Ohler proposes that psychoactive plants, particularly iboga in the Central African rainforest, played a crucial role.

Iboga, now central to the "psychedelic renaissance," may be humanity's oldest drug. Elephants eat iboga root and leaves, then walk backwards and behave unusually—behavior early humans would have observed. Over perhaps 100,000 years in the rainforest, humans consuming iboga could have experienced the neuroplasticity necessary for consciousness development. A Columbia University iboga expert Ohler interviewed described how iboga works differently from classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin—it's "everywhere at the same time in the brain," like a "spa for neurons," immediately identifying and addressing problems like addiction or depression.

The Moses story provides another example. Moses, traumatized from killing a man and fleeing Egypt, spent days fasting in the Sinai desert with 66 companions—essentially a psychedelic retreat. The Bible repeatedly mentions acacia trees in this passage, and Egyptian acacia contains DMT. Israeli scholars have examined this, suggesting Moses's burning bush vision and reception of the Ten Commandments occurred during a DMT experience. The commandment "thou shalt not kill" would be particularly significant for someone processing trauma from having killed.

Religious history is filled with drug connections. Judaism's Purim festival encourages intoxication to get closer to God. Sufis use intoxication for ecstatic religious experiences. Conversely, conservative Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah defended Damascus against Mongols partly through anti-drug rhetoric, claiming invaders brought corrupting substances. Christianity's relationship with drugs is complex—sometimes incorporating them (wine as Christ's blood) but often prohibitionist (the beer purity law eliminating psychoactive ingredients).

## 15. The Minoan Civilization and Drug Trade

***"The Minoans became incredibly wealthy through olive oil and opium trade through that harbor. So you could say that the whole of European high culture started with drug dealers in a way."***

Ohler's research into Cretan history revealed surprising connections between drugs and the origins of European civilization. The Minoan culture on Crete represented Europe's first "high culture"—suddenly producing intricate art, sophisticated architecture, and complex social organization. Conventional archaeology struggles to explain why this advancement occurred specifically on Crete rather than elsewhere in Europe.

While vacationing in Crete with his children, Ohler found an old book in a bookshop describing a maritime archaeological site. Swimming at that location, he discovered remnants of a harbor wall on the seafloor. Climbing over the fence of the still-unexplored archaeological site, he found massive walls—the largest from the entire Bronze Age. This was a major harbor, and the next question was: what did they trade?

Crete was the first place to produce olive oil, which became a valuable commodity. But they also cultivated poppies and produced opium—the most potent pain medicine available and essentially the only reliable analgesic of the ancient world. The Minoans became extraordinarily wealthy trading these commodities through this harbor. Their wealth funded the art, architecture, and cultural development that influenced later Greek civilization and, by extension, all of European culture.

This creates a provocative historical claim: European high culture's origins trace to drug trade. The Minoan civilization's prosperity came from being essentially Bronze Age drug dealers (though "medicine dealers" would be more accurate for opium's role at the time). This wealth enabled cultural development that spread to Athens and throughout Europe. The connection between consciousness-altering substances and cultural advancement appears repeatedly throughout history.

The pattern extends to Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, humanity's first known monumental structure, built approximately 11,000 years ago. No one understands why hunter-gatherers would construct such a complex meeting place. Ohler proposes it served as a gathering site for geographically dispersed human groups to meet, party, and—crucially—have sex with people outside their immediate community. With only 1-4 million humans on Earth, inbreeding was a constant threat. Göbekli Tepe functioned as an evolutionary machine, bringing diverse groups together to create genetically healthy children.

After 800 years, beer production began at Göbekli Tepe (chemical evidence confirms this). The site's nature changed with beer's introduction—different stone circles were constructed, suggesting beer's social effects altered how people gathered. This represents an early example of how psychoactive substances (alcohol being one) influenced human social organization and cultural development.

## 16. Hierarchies, Kings, and the Role of Beer

***"The hierarchy, which is the big problem right now that we have these hierarchies, that we have these kings everywhere that steal our money—that started with beer becoming a business."***

One of Ohler's most provocative historical arguments concerns the origins of human hierarchies and kingship. For thousands of years after the Ice Age ended, humans organized themselves without kings or formal hierarchies. From approximately 10,000 BCE until the Sumerian high culture around 3000 BCE, there's no evidence of rulers. Communities like Çatalhöyük in eastern Turkey functioned for 2,000 years without hierarchical structures—a remarkable achievement suggesting humans are naturally capable of egalitarian organization.

The first identifiable king was Gilgamesh in the Sumerian city of Uruk, around 2700 BCE. The Epic of Gilgamesh celebrates this "great king," but the question is: why did kingship suddenly emerge after millennia of egalitarian organization? Ohler's research suggests beer played a crucial role in this transformation.

Beer existed long before kings—the first beer was made at Göbekli Tepe around 10,000 BCE. However, beer production initially remained small-scale and communal. The critical change came when beer became a business—when production scaled up and became controlled by specific institutions. In Sumerian culture, temples began brewing beer, labeling it with their temple's name, and selling it. Temples that produced popular beer gained wealth and status, creating the first significant economic hierarchies.

This pattern repeated in medieval Europe, where monasteries became major beer producers. The institution controlling beer production gained economic power, which translated into social and political power. Beer's social effects—creating group cohesion, reducing inhibitions, making people more susceptible to authority—made it an ideal tool for emerging power structures. Unlike psychedelics that increase individual neuroplasticity and questioning of authority, alcohol creates group conformity and us-versus-them thinking.

The implications are profound: the hierarchical structures dominating modern civilization—nation-states, concentrated wealth, authoritarian power—may have originated from the commercialization of psychoactive substances, particularly alcohol. This represents a departure from earlier human organization that may have been more egalitarian and possibly influenced by different psychoactive substances (psychedelics rather than alcohol).

Ohler argues that overcoming these hierarchies is essential for human survival. The current system of nation-states, borders, and concentrated power prevents the planetary-scale cooperation necessary to address existential challenges. He envisions a future (perhaps 50 years away) with planetary governance, open-source AI assistance, universal basic income, and elimination of borders—essentially returning to a more egalitarian organization but at global scale with technological assistance.

## 17. Berlin's Electronic Music Culture and Drug Scene

***"In the '90s, it was new. So you really went into the club and you heard something you never heard before."***

Ohler's personal connection to Berlin's 1990s club culture provides insight into how drugs, music, and social movements intersect. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the city became a unique cultural space—cheap, ungentrified, full of abandoned buildings, and not yet Germany's capital (which remained in Bonn). This created conditions similar to 1920s Berlin: openness, experimentation, and cultural innovation.

Electronic music, particularly techno, emerged as the soundtrack for this era. Detroit and Berlin claimed to be techno's birthplaces, with both cities contributing to the genre's development. For Ohler, the transition from rock to electronic music was marked by Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994. The next day, a friend sent him a cassette of electronic music from Berlin, and he realized a paradigm shift had occurred—the era of the hero on stage was over, replaced by collective dance experiences.

Clubs like Tresor (meaning "vault," located in an actual bank vault) became legendary venues. Ohler describes entering these spaces in his mid-20s, taking MDMA, and dancing for 8 hours to music he'd never heard before, surrounded by 500 people also on MDMA. The combination of novel electronic sounds, communal drug experience, and post-Wall Berlin's unique atmosphere created something genuinely new in human cultural experience.

The drug of choice was MDMA (ecstasy), which creates empathy, emotional openness, and desire for connection—perfect for dance culture. Unlike methamphetamine's aggressive energy or alcohol's group conformity, MDMA fostered a sense of unity and love among strangers. The music itself—complex, layered electronic compositions—worked synergistically with MDMA's effects, creating experiences that felt transcendent.

However, Ohler recognized this lifestyle's unsustainability. After two years of going out Friday through Monday, he realized he couldn't maintain productivity. The experience was valuable—even research for future writing—but couldn't be a permanent lifestyle. Many Berliners continued this pattern, but Ohler chose to step back, eventually channeling these experiences into his writing about drugs and history.

Contemporary Berlin still carries echoes of this culture. Clubs remain important, drugs are relatively accessible, and the city attracts people seeking freedom from conventional constraints. However, gentrification has changed the landscape significantly. Ohler compares it to pre-Giuliani New York, where he lived in the early 1990s for $300/month rent, surrounded by artists. Giuliani's mayoralty introduced gentrification that "ruined the city," transforming it from an affordable creative space to an expensive, sanitized version of itself.

## 18. The Writing Process and Drug Use

***"For me, writing has two important parts. One of them is the actual writing part, and that's the painful part. It's basically discipline, focus. The other part is the inspirational part."***

Ohler's perspective on writing and drugs comes from both his novelist background and his experience as a historical researcher. He distinguishes between the disciplined work of actual writing and the inspirational work of generating ideas and perspectives. These two phases benefit from different approaches to consciousness.

The writing phase requires focus, discipline, and sobriety. Ohler does his best work at the Nietzsche House in Sils-Maria, Switzerland—a high-altitude location where Nietzsche spent summers from 1882-1888 (except 1887) writing most of his major works. Ohler rents rooms there, finding the environment conducive to focused work. He describes it as magical, allowing him to switch off his phone and work like a soldier. Nietzsche's presence is palpable—his room remains open as a museum, and Ohler speaks to him occasionally.

Interestingly, Nietzsche himself experimented with drugs, particularly hashish, though this is rarely discussed. Ohler found documentation of this in the Nietzsche House archives. This connects to the broader pattern of writers using substances—Kerouac's amphetamine-fueled writing of "On the Road" in two weeks, Philip K. Dick's amphetamine use while writing science fiction, Malcolm Lowry and Hemingway's alcohol-dependent writing processes.

However, Ohler emphasizes he would never write while on LSD. The drug makes him want to walk in forests or climb mountains, not sit before a computer screen. The one exception was a high-altitude LSD trip in the mountains near the Nietzsche House while working on "Stoned Sapiens." He didn't take notes but let ideas about the book's structure play out in his mind. Descending, he passed a cave and gained profound appreciation for cave paintings—seeing how alive the rock walls appear on LSD, understanding why humans chose these canvases for art.

This experience illustrates LSD's value for the inspirational phase of writing. The drug doesn't make you write better in the moment, but it can provide perspectives, insights, and understandings that inform later sober writing. Ohler's first LSD trip in 1993 Manhattan, despite being terrifying, taught him the world is "quite colorful" rather than black and white, that "the abyss" exists alongside beauty, and that reality is far deeper than he'd understood as a "happy-go-lucky kid."

For research and writing about drugs, Ohler believes direct experience is essential. He tried crystal meth specifically to understand how German soldiers felt in tanks during the French campaign. While he "can't recommend it" (describing it as toxic, stressful on the organism, with effects less interesting than LSD), the experience gave him embodied knowledge impossible to gain from documents alone. Similarly, his various psychedelic experiences informed his ability to write about historical drug use with authenticity and nuance.

## 19. The Meaning of Life and Consciousness

***"I somehow think that the universe has a big story to tell, or it's telling a big story the whole time, and our consciousness is part of that bigger story."***

When asked about life's meaning, Ohler offers a perspective shaped by his psychedelic experiences and historical research. He sees individual consciousness as part of a larger universal narrative—not in a mystical sense, but as a recognition that human awareness participates in something beyond individual existence.

This understanding came particularly from an LSD experience in the mountains about a month before the interview. Walking at high altitude, Ohler felt he was perceiving more of "the bigger story" than normal consciousness allows. Mountains, he explains, extend high into the atmosphere and contain diverse minerals, receiving cosmic energy that hits Earth. On LSD, without the default mode network's filtering that categorizes everything ("this is the tree, this is the path, this is the mountain, now it's 2:00, I have to go back"), he felt more open to direct perception.

He couldn't articulate exactly what he perceived, but described it as getting closer to "the meaning of life" through direct experience rather than conceptual understanding. This aligns with how artists, mathematicians, and other creative people describe inspiration—moments when they grasp connections and meanings beyond their ability to immediately formulate. A mathematician might sense relationships before being able to prove them formally; an open, receptive state makes them a better mathematician.

Ohler sees his art as attempting to contribute to "freeing brain waves" and helping people understand more of this bigger story. He doesn't claim to know what it is, but values the process of understanding more and connecting in different ways. This is why he appreciates being in nature—cities create what Walter Benjamin called "boxed human beings," living in constrained, repetitive patterns. Nature provides access to something beyond these boxes.

The meaning of life, then, isn't a fixed answer but an ongoing process of opening to larger patterns and connections. Psychedelics facilitate this by temporarily reducing the brain's filtering mechanisms, allowing perception of aspects of reality normally obscured by conditioned thinking. This doesn't mean psychedelics are necessary—contemplation, meditation, artistic practice, and other methods can achieve similar openness—but they represent one powerful tool for accessing these states.

Ohler quotes Terence McKenna: "Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles." This captures his philosophy: courageously engaging with consciousness, reality, and the larger story—whether through psychedelics, historical research, or artistic creation—is itself meaningful. The process of understanding, connecting, and contributing to human knowledge and consciousness represents life's purpose.

## 20. The Future of Psychedelic Research and Society

***"If we are somehow care for the human race, then resistance becomes a very immediate and important topic, because you can resist—obviously your brain is yours—you can resist in many ways, just by thinking."***

Ohler's work points toward a future where psychedelics play a recognized role in mental health treatment, consciousness exploration, and perhaps social transformation. The "psychedelic renaissance" of recent years has seen renewed research into substances prohibited for decades, revealing therapeutic potential for PTSD, depression, addiction, end-of-life anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

His mother's experience with psilocybin microdoses for Alzheimer's demonstrates this potential. On Mother's Day, after taking a microdose, she picked up a newspaper for the first time in a year and read headlines about the Ukraine war—a conflict she'd never heard of because she hadn't engaged with news for so long. The mushroom microdose stimulated her brain more strongly than her father's (who "never feels anything from a microdose"), temporarily restoring cognitive function that Alzheimer's had destroyed.

This personal experience motivated Ohler's research into LSD's history, resulting in "Tripped." The book traces why a substance showing promise for treating trauma and mental illness became illegal—not due to scientific evidence of harm, but because of CIA control desires and cultural panic. Understanding this history is crucial for ensuring future psychedelic research and therapy aren't derailed by similar forces.

However, Ohler emphasizes caution about recommending psychedelics. When asked if he recommends them, he says no as a general statement, only discussing his personal experiences on a case-by-case basis with specific people. Psychedelics are powerful tools that can be overwhelming, especially for people with psychological instability. The mind is complicated, and these substances can take users in unpredictable directions. While many people have transformative, healing experiences, others might encounter difficulties they're unprepared to handle.

The question of when to use psychedelics—in good times or bad—remains complex. Scientific studies show psilocybin helps with depression and PTSD, suggesting value during difficult periods. Yet Ohler notes that in concentration camps, even slight positive experiences become intensely meaningful—suggesting that psychedelics might provide profound experiences even (or especially) in terrible circumstances. The key is proper set, setting, and support.

Looking broader, Ohler sees psychedelics as potentially contributing to social transformation by fostering the neuroplasticity necessary to overcome conditioned thinking. Hierarchical power structures, nation-states, and authoritarian systems benefit from populations that accept conditioned beliefs without question. Substances that increase empathy, reduce fear, enhance neuroplasticity, and encourage questioning of authority are inherently threatening to such systems—which partly explains their prohibition.

The future Ohler envisions involves overcoming hierarchies that originated when beer became a business in ancient Sumeria. He imagines planetary governance without borders, open-source AI assistance, universal basic income, and egalitarian organization at global scale—essentially returning to pre-hierarchical human organization but with technology enabling coordination at planetary level. Whether psychedelics will play a role in this transformation remains uncertain, but their ability to foster empathy, connection, and new perspectives suggests they might contribute to the consciousness shift such changes would require.
