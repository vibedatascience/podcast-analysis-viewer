But in the last couple of years, the But in the last couple of years, the massive economic and kind of manpower massive economic and kind of manpower and industrial advantages of the north and industrial advantages of the north marshaled by Ulyses SGrant uh have begun marshaled by Ulyses SGrant uh have begun to tell. Tom, we were talking about to tell. Tom, we were talking about Grant before the show, weren't we? We Grant before the show, weren't we? We agreed both boring and corrupt. agreed both boring and corrupt.

American listeners won't like that American listeners won't like that because they think Grants is brilliant. because they think Grants is brilliant. Brilliant at marshalling industrial Brilliant at marshalling industrial resources. Well, I tell you who else resources. Well, I tell you who else went like that is um Daniel Jackson, went like that is um Daniel Jackson, friend of the show, The Voice of the friend of the show, The Voice of the Northeast, who's a big fan of Ulyses SG Northeast, who's a big fan of Ulyses SG Grant because Ulyses Srant went to Grant because Ulyses Srant went to Newcastle, I believe. Newcastle, I believe. Exactly. Exactly. Anyway, let's get back Exactly. Exactly. Anyway, let's get back to the story. At the end of 1864, the to the story. At the end of 1864, the Union Army captured Atlanta. Key moment Union Army captured Atlanta. Key moment in the war. Uh General Sherman, uh who in the war. Uh General Sherman, uh who people may remember from our Kuster people may remember from our Kuster series, makes his famous march to the series, makes his famous march to the sea that basically tears a hole in the sea that basically tears a hole in the economic and kind of transport networks economic and kind of transport networks of the Confederacy. So from that point of the Confederacy. So from that point on, the Confederacy really is on on, the Confederacy really is on borrowed time. And the one hope the borrowed time. And the one hope the Confederates had, the one hope the slave Confederates had, the one hope the slave South had was that Lincoln would lose South had was that Lincoln would lose his re-election bid in November to the his re-election bid in November to the Democrat candidate George Mlelen. Um now Democrat candidate George Mlelen. Um now the Democrats wanted an end to the war the Democrats wanted an end to the war immediately in a negotiated settlement immediately in a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy, but Lincoln won with the Confederacy, but Lincoln won that election pretty comfortably. So now that election pretty comfortably. So now everybody knows that the war is going to everybody knows that the war is going to be fought to the bitter end. Is there be fought to the bitter end. Is there never any thought on the part of uh say never any thought on the part of uh say Jefferson Davis uh the Confederate Jefferson Davis uh the Confederate president and his entourage that they president and his entourage that they might assassinate Lincoln? That's never might assassinate Lincoln? That's never discussed not among the Confederate discussed not among the Confederate leaders but in Confederate newspapers as leaders but in Confederate newspapers as we shall see. There is a lot of talk of we shall see. There is a lot of talk of this and there is an analogy they use this and there is an analogy they use that will please you greatly because it that will please you greatly because it plays to your strengths. Incidentally, I plays to your strengths. Incidentally, I read on the Reddit today of somebody read on the Reddit today of somebody complaining there's too much talk of complaining there's too much talk of Julius Caesar in the rest of history. Julius Caesar in the rest of history. So, there is a spoiler alert about the a So, there is a spoiler alert about the a comparison that will be made. So, to get comparison that will be made. So, to get back to the inauguration, the scene, I back to the inauguration, the scene, I mean, this is an extraordinary moment mean, this is an extraordinary moment for Lincoln. Lincoln is the first for Lincoln. Lincoln is the first president to win re-election since president to win re-election since Andrew Jackson back in 1832. So, winning Andrew Jackson back in 1832. So, winning re-election is actually quite unusual in re-election is actually quite unusual in American politics in the 19th century. American politics in the 19th century. That's interesting because it's the That's interesting because it's the opposite to 20th century, isn't it? opposite to 20th century, isn't it? Exactly. Basically, in the 19th century, Exactly. Basically, in the 19th century, people just want to throw the president people just want to throw the president out as quickly as possible, I think, by out as quickly as possible, I think, by and large. Now, Lincoln is a very and large. Now, Lincoln is a very unexpected person to even be president. unexpected person to even be president. He'd been born into poverty in Kentucky He'd been born into poverty in Kentucky in 1809. He'd grown up in a log cabin, in 1809. He'd grown up in a log cabin, which becomes a a very important part of which becomes a a very important part of his mythology. He's self-educated. his mythology. He's self-educated. Initially, he was going to be a Initially, he was going to be a blacksmith, but he ends up a kind of blacksmith, but he ends up a kind of prairie lawyer. He becomes active in prairie lawyer. He becomes active in state politics in Illinois. He then state politics in Illinois. He then becomes a prominent figure in the new becomes a prominent figure in the new anti-slavery Republican party in the anti-slavery Republican party in the 1850s. And when he's nominated by the 1850s. And when he's nominated by the Republicans as their presidential Republicans as their presidential candidate in 1860 is quite unexpected, candidate in 1860 is quite unexpected, he's not really he's not a top tier he's not really he's not a top tier household name. But he wins the household name. But he wins the presidency and that that's the trigger presidency and that that's the trigger for the slaveowning southern states who for the slaveowning southern states who are outraged by his elevation to secede are outraged by his elevation to secede from the Union and to form the from the Union and to form the Confederacy. So Lincoln is propelled Confederacy. So Lincoln is propelled into this position that's unprecedented into this position that's unprecedented in American history. He is facing one of in American history. He is facing one of the world's first modern industrialized the world's first modern industrialized conflicts. So it's a conflict of conflicts. So it's a conflict of railroads and steamships and trenches railroads and steamships and trenches and prison camps, all of these kinds of and prison camps, all of these kinds of things that kills about 700,000 people. things that kills about 700,000 people. So something he could never have So something he could never have anticipated before even before running anticipated before even before running for president. Anyway, this is his for president. Anyway, this is his second inauguration. Now, you would second inauguration. Now, you would expect it under those circumstances to expect it under those circumstances to be a very solemn and serious occasion be a very solemn and serious occasion befitting his rhetoric. But do you know befitting his rhetoric. But do you know what what I love about this is it what what I love about this is it Charles Dickens would have very much Charles Dickens would have very much enjoyed it cuz he's not an admirer of enjoyed it cuz he's not an admirer of 19th century America. 19th century America. So, it's like a scene from Martin So, it's like a scene from Martin Chazawwit. Chazawwit. Chazawwit. It is like a scene from Martin Chazawit It is like a scene from Martin Chazawit basically. So, it's pouring with rain. basically. So, it's pouring with rain. There are far too many people. There's There are far too many people. There's massive crowds. The capital is massive crowds. The capital is overwhelmed and the place is packed with overwhelmed and the place is packed with women in long muddy soden skirts sort of women in long muddy soden skirts sort of wrestling for places in the gallery. Now wrestling for places in the gallery. Now Lincoln has picked a new vice president Lincoln has picked a new vice president to kind of balance the ticket create a to kind of balance the ticket create a sense of national unity and this is a sense of national unity and this is a guy from Tennessee called Andrew guy from Tennessee called Andrew Johnson. So he's a former Democrat and Johnson. So he's a former Democrat and he's actually from a confederate slave he's actually from a confederate slave state. state. state. And Dominic, it's important that And Dominic, it's important that listeners don't muddle him up with listeners don't muddle him up with Andrew Jackson, isn't it? who'd came Andrew Jackson, isn't it? who'd came earlier or Lyndon Johnson. So, he's just earlier or Lyndon Johnson. So, he's just Andrew Johnson. He's his own man, Tom. Andrew Johnson. He's his own man, Tom. He's had typhoid, so he's very weak. And He's had typhoid, so he's very weak. And to um try and sort of steady himself, he to um try and sort of steady himself, he drinks three glasses of brandy. And the drinks three glasses of brandy. And the brandy goes completely to his head, and brandy goes completely to his head, and he absolutely disgraces himself by he absolutely disgraces himself by making this interminable and rambling making this interminable and rambling speech. He keeps forgetting everyone's speech. He keeps forgetting everyone's names. At one point, he grabs the Bible names. At one point, he grabs the Bible and starts slobbering over it and and starts slobbering over it and kissing it. Then, he just won't stop kissing it. Then, he just won't stop talking. So he's like Gussy Frink Nottle talking. So he's like Gussy Frink Nottle after drinking the vodka laced orange after drinking the vodka laced orange juice in PG Woodhouse. juice in PG Woodhouse. The New York World reporting on the The New York World reporting on the inauguration said he defiled our council inauguration said he defiled our council chamber chamber chamber with the spewings of a drunken bore with the spewings of a drunken bore which I like. So then Lincoln gives his which I like. So then Lincoln gives his speech. Brilliant. He tried to raise the speech. Brilliant. He tried to raise the tone. And then there's the inauguration tone. And then there's the inauguration banquet and the crowd go completely banquet and the crowd go completely bonkers and I quote, "They pushed the bonkers and I quote, "They pushed the tables from their places, snatched off tables from their places, snatched off whole turkeys and loaves of cake, whole turkeys and loaves of cake, smashed crockery and glassear, spilled smashed crockery and glassear, spilled oyster and terrapin on each other's oyster and terrapin on each other's heads, ruined costly dresses, and made heads, ruined costly dresses, and made the floor sticky with food. And if the floor sticky with food. And if you've ever been to an American buffet, you've ever been to an American buffet, you will recognize this behavior. I you will recognize this behavior. I think I've been to an American buffet. think I've been to an American buffet. I've never seen guests pouring tapin I've never seen guests pouring tapin over each other's heads." only says over each other's heads." only says heads. You'd have to be holding the heads. You'd have to be holding the terapin up quite high. Quite a big ask. terapin up quite high. Quite a big ask. There's actually one nice moment which There's actually one nice moment which is the great black abolitionist is the great black abolitionist Frederick Douglas turns up at the White Frederick Douglas turns up at the White House reception. He's turned away House reception. He's turned away because he's black. And Lincoln hears because he's black. And Lincoln hears reports of this and he says, "No, no, reports of this and he says, "No, no, no, no. Have him in. Have him in." And no, no. Have him in. Have him in." And then he makes a great show of shaking then he makes a great show of shaking Douglas's hand because he's a great Douglas's hand because he's a great showman, isn't he? showman, isn't he? Yeah. He's a great showman and he's also Yeah. He's a great showman and he's also a nice person. So that reflects well on a nice person. So that reflects well on Lincoln, I think. But everybody is Lincoln, I think. But everybody is really struck at the time. And they say, really struck at the time. And they say, "Lincoln looks awful. He looks "Lincoln looks awful. He looks absolutely shattered." The Chicago absolutely shattered." The Chicago Tribune, the listeners were painfully Tribune, the listeners were painfully impressed with his gaunt skeleton-like impressed with his gaunt skeleton-like appearance. appearance. appearance. And this is not because, like you, Tom, And this is not because, like you, Tom, he spends all his time in the gym. But I he spends all his time in the gym. But I don't have a gaunt skeleton-like don't have a gaunt skeleton-like appearance. I glow with health. That's appearance. I glow with health. That's the difference. the difference. the difference. Oh, is that the difference? Okay. Right. Oh, is that the difference? Okay. Right. I'm glad we've cleared that up. Um, he I'm glad we've cleared that up. Um, he is like you. He's in his uh late 50s. Is is like you. He's in his uh late 50s. Is that fair to say? that fair to say? And working under unprecedented And working under unprecedented pressure. There is a point of pressure. There is a point of similarity. similarity. similarity. What about this bit? He strikes visitors What about this bit? He strikes visitors as gray, lined, and haggarded. as gray, lined, and haggarded. No, that's not me. So, he's he's No, that's not me. So, he's he's absolutely shattered. And it's not just absolutely shattered. And it's not just about the the war. It's about the about the the war. It's about the pressure of Washington politics. So, pressure of Washington politics. So, Washington politics at this point, it's Washington politics at this point, it's an intensely kind of faction-ridden, an intensely kind of faction-ridden, disputatious place. And part of this is disputatious place. And part of this is because the war has placed unprecedented because the war has placed unprecedented demands on the American system. So, you demands on the American system. So, you know, the federal government is being know, the federal government is being asked to do things this has never done asked to do things this has never done before. but also they're confronting before. but also they're confronting absolutely existential challenges. What absolutely existential challenges. What are they going to do about slavery and are they going to do about slavery and what are they going to do about the what are they going to do about the rebel states of the South? So on rebel states of the South? So on slavery, the House of Representatives slavery, the House of Representatives has just approved something called the has just approved something called the 13th Amendment. If you've seen the the 13th Amendment. If you've seen the the film Lincoln, the Steven Spielberg film, film Lincoln, the Steven Spielberg film, this is a big part of that story. So this is a big part of that story. So they've passed the 13th Amendment and they've passed the 13th Amendment and the states have just begun to approve the states have just begun to approve it. So about 18 of them, I think, have it. So about 18 of them, I think, have approved it by the time of Lincoln's approved it by the time of Lincoln's inauguration. So the the bigger question inauguration. So the the bigger question now is what on earth do you do with the now is what on earth do you do with the Confederate South once they've lost? Now Confederate South once they've lost? Now for weeks Lincoln has been striking for weeks Lincoln has been striking quite a consiliatory note. In February quite a consiliatory note. In February he had met Confederate negotiators on a he had met Confederate negotiators on a steamer anchored in the Hampton Roads steamer anchored in the Hampton Roads and they' had these talks and he had and they' had these talks and he had really gone out of his way to seem really gone out of his way to seem imlliant. He had actually said, you imlliant. He had actually said, you know, if you will rejoin the Union, we I know, if you will rejoin the Union, we I will look into ways in which you can be will look into ways in which you can be recompensed for the abolition of recompensed for the abolition of slavery, southern slaveholders would be slavery, southern slaveholders would be compensated with northern taxes for compensated with northern taxes for their financial losses. And a lot of their financial losses. And a lot of listeners may find that puzzling given listeners may find that puzzling given that they've been fighting the war, but that they've been fighting the war, but one of his friends said the one thing one of his friends said the one thing that Lincoln feared was anarchy in the that Lincoln feared was anarchy in the South. When the Confederacy breaks up, South. When the Confederacy breaks up, what he doesn't want is the whole thing what he doesn't want is the whole thing to fall apart in chaos. What he wants is to fall apart in chaos. What he wants is to close the war upon such terms as to close the war upon such terms as would make the southern people and would make the southern people and southern soldiers think somewhat kindly southern soldiers think somewhat kindly of the union to which they were brought of the union to which they were brought back by force of arms. In other words, back by force of arms. In other words, we will welcome the prodigal son back we will welcome the prodigal son back into the family. It's what you'd expect into the family. It's what you'd expect though, isn't it? Because I know that though, isn't it? Because I know that all the various reasons um for which the all the various reasons um for which the civil war is forked, but one of them civil war is forked, but one of them surely must be to preserve the strength surely must be to preserve the strength and integrity of the United States and and integrity of the United States and and keep it as a continental power. So, and keep it as a continental power. So, you absolutely have to make the defeated you absolutely have to make the defeated Confederates feel like they are Confederates feel like they are Americans once again because otherwise Americans once again because otherwise you've defeated the entire purpose of you've defeated the entire purpose of what you've been fighting for. Abraham what you've been fighting for. Abraham Lincoln would agree with you. Abraham Lincoln would agree with you. Abraham Lincoln would absolutely agree with you. Lincoln would absolutely agree with you. However, a lot of people in his own However, a lot of people in his own party would not. So, these are people party would not. So, these are people who are called the radical Republicans who are called the radical Republicans and quite a lot of them are actually and quite a lot of them are actually saying there should be no clemency for saying there should be no clemency for the traitors at all. Lincoln's own vice the traitors at all. Lincoln's own vice president, Andrew Johnson, who's not a president, Andrew Johnson, who's not a radical Republican, uh, but I think radical Republican, uh, but I think partly because he is from the south and partly because he is from the south and there's a lot of kind of internal there's a lot of kind of internal feuding going on among southerners, he feuding going on among southerners, he says treason must be made odious. In says treason must be made odious. In other words, the traitors must be other words, the traitors must be punished and impoverished. So, in other punished and impoverished. So, in other words, go hard on them. That's actually words, go hard on them. That's actually not how he it turns out when he's not how he it turns out when he's president. So, you've got the radical president. So, you've got the radical Republicans saying, "Go much harder on Republicans saying, "Go much harder on them. Lincoln's too weak." And on the them. Lincoln's too weak." And on the other side, you've got moderates and other side, you've got moderates and Democrats who say, "Actually, you know, Democrats who say, "Actually, you know, Lincoln's in danger of being too harsh. Lincoln's in danger of being too harsh. We should readmit the southern states as We should readmit the southern states as quickly as possible. Don't expect them quickly as possible. Don't expect them to behave in a very nice way to their to behave in a very nice way to their former slaves. Wind up the military former slaves. Wind up the military administrations in the South, all of administrations in the South, all of this kind of thing." So, Lincoln is the this kind of thing." So, Lincoln is the centrist in this. centrist in this. There are huge arguments going on, which There are huge arguments going on, which we don't massively need to go into, we don't massively need to go into, between Lincoln and the radicals about, between Lincoln and the radicals about, you know, what's the oath that you will you know, what's the oath that you will get the Confederates to swear? how many get the Confederates to swear? how many voters in former Confederate states will voters in former Confederate states will have to take an oath of allegiance and have to take an oath of allegiance and pledge to support the the Union and all pledge to support the the Union and all this kind of thing. One other explosive this kind of thing. One other explosive issue, who will get to vote when the issue, who will get to vote when the Confederacy is readmitted to the Union? Confederacy is readmitted to the Union? Will former slaves be allowed to vote? Will former slaves be allowed to vote? Because as of 1864, virtually no black Because as of 1864, virtually no black Americans can vote at all. There are Americans can vote at all. There are handful in New York, but there are very, handful in New York, but there are very, very strict property qualifications. But very strict property qualifications. But of course, if you allow millions of of course, if you allow millions of newly infranchised newly infranchised newly infranchised African-Americans to vote, that would African-Americans to vote, that would completely change politics. And in the completely change politics. And in the Spielberg film, that is how they get the Spielberg film, that is how they get the Gettysburg address in, isn't it? That Gettysburg address in, isn't it? That Lincoln sits there and he talks to a Lincoln sits there and he talks to a black soldier who says, "We know we black soldier who says, "We know we don't have the vote and then completes don't have the vote and then completes the, you know, he he speaks the the, you know, he he speaks the Gettysburg address." Exactly. And Gettysburg address." Exactly. And actually, the black soldier, that's an actually, the black soldier, that's an important point. There have been almost important point. There have been almost 200,000 black Americans serving in the 200,000 black Americans serving in the Union Army and privately Lincoln has Union Army and privately Lincoln has already told his friends. I think it's already told his friends. I think it's completely unreasonable for us to ask completely unreasonable for us to ask these men to fight and die for the Union these men to fight and die for the Union but then not to allow them to vote but then not to allow them to vote afterwards. So he's got a lot of afterwards. So he's got a lot of challenges because these are very challenges because these are very controversial issues and I think it's controversial issues and I think it's partly because of the weight of this partly because of the weight of this burden that he's very keen to get out of burden that he's very keen to get out of the city. So on the 20th of March, the city. So on the 20th of March, General Grant who has cornered Robert E. General Grant who has cornered Robert E. Lee, the Confederates leading general in Lee, the Confederates leading general in Northern Virginia. Grant invites Lincoln Northern Virginia. Grant invites Lincoln to the front. Says, "Do you want to come to the front. Says, "Do you want to come and see the action?" You can see this in and see the action?" You can see this in the film Lincoln, Taby's favorite film. the film Lincoln, Taby's favorite film. The big disagreement with me and Tabby The big disagreement with me and Tabby on this is I don't like that piano music on this is I don't like that piano music that Americans love in in kind of Civil that Americans love in in kind of Civil War documentaries and films. I find it War documentaries and films. I find it offensively tinkly. Anyway, that's by offensively tinkly. Anyway, that's by the by. He sails down on this steamer to the by. He sails down on this steamer to go and see Grant. Now, the big theme of go and see Grant. Now, the big theme of this whole section is the horribleness this whole section is the horribleness of Lincoln's wife. So, she's called Mary of Lincoln's wife. So, she's called Mary Todd Lincoln. I think the film doesn't Todd Lincoln. I think the film doesn't capture what an absolute monster she is, capture what an absolute monster she is, which may sound harsh, but basically, which may sound harsh, but basically, here's the scene, right? They've gone on here's the scene, right? They've gone on this boat. He's called the River Queen. this boat. He's called the River Queen. General Grant turns up with his wife, General Grant turns up with his wife, Julia. Grant and Lincoln go off to talk Julia. Grant and Lincoln go off to talk about the war, and Julia goes to sit about the war, and Julia goes to sit down next to Mrs. Lincoln, and Mrs. down next to Mrs. Lincoln, and Mrs. Lincoln shrieks at her, "How dare you be Lincoln shrieks at her, "How dare you be seated until I invite you to sit down?" seated until I invite you to sit down?" And this is typical. This is how she And this is typical. This is how she carries on. So, a friend of Julia Grant carries on. So, a friend of Julia Grant said afterwards, "Mrs. Lincoln seemed said afterwards, "Mrs. Lincoln seemed insanely jealous of every person and insanely jealous of every person and everything." So, a couple of days later, everything." So, a couple of days later, they go off riding to look at some they go off riding to look at some battle or something, and another battle or something, and another general's wife is there, General Ord's general's wife is there, General Ord's wife, who's very good-looking, and she wife, who's very good-looking, and she ends up riding next to Lincoln. And when ends up riding next to Lincoln. And when uh Mary Link, Todd Lincoln sees this, uh Mary Link, Todd Lincoln sees this, she shrieks again. She says, "What does she shrieks again. She says, "What does that woman mean by riding next to the that woman mean by riding next to the president, blah blah blah blah blah." president, blah blah blah blah blah." And Mrs. Grant says to her, "Oh, I think And Mrs. Grant says to her, "Oh, I think it's just an accident. Don't worry about it's just an accident. Don't worry about it." And Mary says, "Oh, I suppose you it." And Mary says, "Oh, I suppose you want to go to the White House yourself, want to go to the White House yourself, do you? Oh, I suppose you see yourself do you? Oh, I suppose you see yourself as the president's wife." I think she as the president's wife." I think she sounds fun. She sounds sassy. She's sounds fun. She sounds sassy. She's worse than sassy. Dominic, just to ask worse than sassy. Dominic, just to ask you, has she I mean, she has been under you, has she I mean, she has been under considerable pressure, hasn't she? considerable pressure, hasn't she? She has, but I mean, her son has died She has, but I mean, her son has died because that's the because that's the Yeah, but come on, Tom. But isn't she Yeah, but come on, Tom. But isn't she kind of she's frustrated by that in a kind of she's frustrated by that in a kind of very Victorian manner? And kind of very Victorian manner? And she is, but it's the 19th century. she is, but it's the 19th century. Hasn't everybody's son died at some Hasn't everybody's son died at some point? point? point? I suppose so. But I don't know. I mean, I suppose so. But I don't know. I mean, maybe she's depressed or I think it's maybe she's depressed or I think it's generally agreed by other other wives generally agreed by other other wives that she is a bit of a what what do you that she is a bit of a what what do you call what's the word you use? A baggage. call what's the word you use? A baggage. A baggage. So on this ride, they get to A baggage. So on this ride, they get to where they're going and Mary Lincoln where they're going and Mary Lincoln goes straight up to this Mrs. or one of goes straight up to this Mrs. or one of Grant's officers watches is and is Grant's officers watches is and is appalled. He says she positively appalled. He says she positively insulted her. She called her vile names insulted her. She called her vile names in the presence of a crowd of officers in the presence of a crowd of officers and asked what she meant by following up and asked what she meant by following up the president by riding next to him. The the president by riding next to him. The poor woman burst into tears and inquired poor woman burst into tears and inquired what she had done, but Mrs. Lincoln what she had done, but Mrs. Lincoln refused to be appeased and stormed until refused to be appeased and stormed until she was tired. Mrs. Grant tried to stand she was tired. Mrs. Grant tried to stand by her friend and everybody was shocked by her friend and everybody was shocked and horrified. He then went on to say, and horrified. He then went on to say, "In the next few days, Mrs. Lincoln "In the next few days, Mrs. Lincoln repeatedly attacked her husband in the repeatedly attacked her husband in the presence of officers because of Mrs. presence of officers because of Mrs. ored Lincoln bore it with an expression ored Lincoln bore it with an expression of pain and sadness which cut one to the of pain and sadness which cut one to the heart but with supreme calmness and heart but with supreme calmness and dignity and to give you a sense I have dignity and to give you a sense I have cut down this story from the sort of a cut down this story from the sort of a billion examples in Michael Berlingame's billion examples in Michael Berlingame's book another general Carl Sch said that book another general Carl Sch said that Mrs. Lincoln was the greatest tragedy of Mrs. Lincoln was the greatest tragedy of Mr. Lincoln's existence and does Mr. Mr. Lincoln's existence and does Mr. Lincoln agree with this? Does he think Lincoln agree with this? Does he think she's awful or does he secretly love she's awful or does he secretly love her? her? her? I think of possibly a bit of both, I think of possibly a bit of both, actually. Do you know what I think of? I actually. Do you know what I think of? I think of that scene on the French think of that scene on the French airplane when with uh Emanuel Macron and airplane when with uh Emanuel Macron and his former teacher. his former teacher. Oh. Where she punched him in the face. Oh. Where she punched him in the face. She punches him in the face and he has She punches him in the face and he has an expression of sort of shock and then an expression of sort of shock and then he arranges his features for the he arranges his features for the cameras. cameras. cameras. I mean, Macaron loves his wife. So maybe I mean, Macaron loves his wife. So maybe Lincoln loved his wife. I don't know. Lincoln loved his wife. I don't know. Anyway, Lincoln spends a few days at the Anyway, Lincoln spends a few days at the front. He he's he's very sort of front. He he's he's very sort of melancholy. There's a nice point which I melancholy. There's a nice point which I think is in the film where he's sitting think is in the film where he's sitting around a campfire with Grant and Grant around a campfire with Grant and Grant says, "Mr. President, did you at any says, "Mr. President, did you at any time doubt the final success of the time doubt the final success of the cause?" And Lincoln says, "Oh, never for cause?" And Lincoln says, "Oh, never for a moment." Yeah, never for a moment. But a moment." Yeah, never for a moment. But most of the time he's actually saying, most of the time he's actually saying, "Oh, the horrors of war. I really hope "Oh, the horrors of war. I really hope this is the end now. I feel terrible this is the end now. I feel terrible about all the people that died." He about all the people that died." He tells a story about seeing a Confederate tells a story about seeing a Confederate soldier, a young soldier dying. When soldier, a young soldier dying. When he's telling people about this, he kind he's telling people about this, he kind of chokes up and he says, "Oh, I feel so of chokes up and he says, "Oh, I feel so terrible. We've cheated. We've robbed terrible. We've cheated. We've robbed both the cradle and the grave. In other both the cradle and the grave. In other words, both the very young and the very words, both the very young and the very old. We have fed them into our the old. We have fed them into our the mincing machine of our kind of military mincing machine of our kind of military operation. And and at one point operation. And and at one point actually, General Sherman arrives and actually, General Sherman arrives and they're talking about the next battle. they're talking about the next battle. And Lincoln says to Sherman and Grant, And Lincoln says to Sherman and Grant, "More bloodshed, really? Can't we avoid "More bloodshed, really? Can't we avoid this battle?" And they say to him, this battle?" And they say to him, "Well, you know, it's not really up to "Well, you know, it's not really up to us. It's up to the Confederates. If the us. It's up to the Confederates. If the Confederates surrender, we will be able Confederates surrender, we will be able to sort of crack on and forget it." Now, to sort of crack on and forget it." Now, as it happens, the noose is tightening as it happens, the noose is tightening around the Confederates all the time. On around the Confederates all the time. On the 2nd of April, while he's going on the 2nd of April, while he's going on these trips, the Confederates are forced these trips, the Confederates are forced to evacuate their capital, Richmond, to evacuate their capital, Richmond, Virginia, which then lies open to the Virginia, which then lies open to the Union forces. And the next day, the Union forces. And the next day, the Confederate defenses at a place called Confederate defenses at a place called Petersburg are broken and General Lee's Petersburg are broken and General Lee's army has to fall back across the army has to fall back across the Appamatics River. So, the end is only Appamatics River. So, the end is only days away. And on the 4th of April, so 2 days away. And on the 4th of April, so 2 days after the Confederate evacuation, days after the Confederate evacuation, Lincoln actually goes to the Confederate Lincoln actually goes to the Confederate capital to Richmond. It is an capital to Richmond. It is an extraordinary moment. I don't actually extraordinary moment. I don't actually remember this in the Spielberg film. remember this in the Spielberg film. Lincoln has been dreaming of this moment Lincoln has been dreaming of this moment all these years. And he says to his all these years. And he says to his aids, "It seems to me that I've been aids, "It seems to me that I've been dreaming a horrid dream for four years, dreaming a horrid dream for four years, and now the nightmare is gone." And he and now the nightmare is gone." And he goes with his son called Tad or Taddyy. goes with his son called Tad or Taddyy. He is um his youngest boy. He's He is um his youngest boy. He's celebrating his 12th birthday. He had a celebrating his 12th birthday. He had a cleft pallet and he suffered from a very cleft pallet and he suffered from a very severe um speech impediment. So, it's a severe um speech impediment. So, it's a kind of sad story with with Tad. And kind of sad story with with Tad. And they travel on this boat, the River they travel on this boat, the River Queen with a military escort and they Queen with a military escort and they land in Richmond quite close to the land in Richmond quite close to the downtown area and it's an incredible downtown area and it's an incredible scene because all the former slaves of scene because all the former slaves of Richmond, they hear the news that Richmond, they hear the news that Lincoln has come and they rush down to Lincoln has come and they rush down to the landing place and the journalists the landing place and the journalists who were there describe them shouting, who were there describe them shouting, "Hallelujah! Harra, harah! Bless the "Hallelujah! Harra, harah! Bless the Lord! Praise the Lord. One guy from the Lord! Praise the Lord. One guy from the Boston Journal said, you know, no Boston Journal said, you know, no written description can capture the written description can capture the emotion of the moment, the shouting and emotion of the moment, the shouting and the dancing and the thanksgivings and the dancing and the thanksgivings and whatnot as they greet this bloke who is whatnot as they greet this bloke who is their liberator. their liberator. their liberator. And Dominic, this guy writing for the And Dominic, this guy writing for the Boston Journal presumably is a war Boston Journal presumably is a war correspondent. And I see in your notes correspondent. And I see in your notes that he's called Charles Coffin. that he's called Charles Coffin. Yes, that's proper nominative Yes, that's proper nominative determinism, isn't it? And there's a determinism, isn't it? And there's a woman there who's shouting like, "Thank woman there who's shouting like, "Thank you, Jesus, that I behold President you, Jesus, that I behold President Lincoln." They all get down and they Lincoln." They all get down and they kneel in front of him and Lincoln I mean kneel in front of him and Lincoln I mean the thing about Lincoln is you're always the thing about Lincoln is you're always looking for the sort of in his looking for the sort of in his armor because it'd be amusing to be armor because it'd be amusing to be revisionist but no such ever revisionist but no such ever appears. He behaves with such dignity appears. He behaves with such dignity and grace and grace and grace and he tells them don't kneel to me and he tells them don't kneel to me kneel to God only. And that's kind of kneel to God only. And that's kind of has a a resonance because the has a a resonance because the emancipation statue that then gets built emancipation statue that then gets built after the war shows a a a freed slave on after the war shows a a a freed slave on on his knee in front of Lincoln and on his knee in front of Lincoln and that's been uh you know very that's been uh you know very controversial now. But Lincoln was ahead controversial now. But Lincoln was ahead of the game really. He wouldn't have of the game really. He wouldn't have approved of that statute. approved of that statute. No, he wouldn't actually. It's a really No, he wouldn't actually. It's a really good point. good point. It's a really good point. Anyway, they they walk into the city. Anyway, they they walk into the city. It's a war zone still. I mean, it's it's It's a war zone still. I mean, it's it's a city with smoldering buildings. a city with smoldering buildings. There's a pole of smoke. It is There's a pole of smoke. It is incredibly hot. Um, there's a famous incredibly hot. Um, there's a famous moment, another famous moment, again, moment, another famous moment, again, very much to Lincoln's credit. They pass very much to Lincoln's credit. They pass an old black man in rags and he's an old black man in rags and he's kneeling on the ground and he clasps his kneeling on the ground and he clasps his hands and he says, "May the good Lord hands and he says, "May the good Lord bless you and keep you safe, Master bless you and keep you safe, Master President Lincoln." And Lincoln takes President Lincoln." And Lincoln takes off his hat and he bows to this man. And off his hat and he bows to this man. And all the watching journalists and all the watching journalists and whatnot, the entourage are astonished by whatnot, the entourage are astonished by this. I mean, it's so telling. And this. I mean, it's so telling. And Charles Coffin said it was a death shock Charles Coffin said it was a death shock to chivalry, meaning the the southern to chivalry, meaning the the southern hierarchical ideals and a mortal wound hierarchical ideals and a mortal wound to cast, to the idea of cast. I mean to cast, to the idea of cast. I mean whether it was a mortal wound, I guess whether it was a mortal wound, I guess you'd say maybe in the very very long you'd say maybe in the very very long run, but obviously as we know at the run, but obviously as we know at the time, white supremacy is actually poised time, white supremacy is actually poised to make a bit of a comeback. Anyway, to make a bit of a comeback. Anyway, but again, I mean, it kind of it but again, I mean, it kind of it illustrates the way in which Lincoln in illustrates the way in which Lincoln in so many ways is, you know, a century and so many ways is, you know, a century and more ahead of conventional thinking. more ahead of conventional thinking. And his his grasp of those sort of And his his grasp of those sort of gestures is unparalleled, I think. gestures is unparalleled, I think. Anyway, they reach the White House of Anyway, they reach the White House of the Confederacy. Have you ever been the Confederacy. Have you ever been there, Tom? there, Tom? there, Tom? No, I haven't. No, No, I haven't. No, I have. It's quite it's quite I have. It's quite it's quite interesting, actually. It's quite weird interesting, actually. It's quite weird cuz it's a bit like the real White House cuz it's a bit like the real White House but just not as good. but just not as good. Right. Well, I mean that's the Right. Well, I mean that's the Confederacy for you, isn't it? Confederacy for you, isn't it? And he he goes and he sits in Jefferson And he he goes and he sits in Jefferson Davis's chair. He's exhausted. He's very Davis's chair. He's exhausted. He's very haggarded. Um he's described by captains haggarded. Um he's described by captains who are there that he looks a tired man who are there that he looks a tired man whose nerves had carried him beyond his whose nerves had carried him beyond his strength. He asks for a glass of water strength. He asks for a glass of water and then they say, "Would you like to go and then they say, "Would you like to go around all Jefferson Davis's around all Jefferson Davis's apartments?" And he says, "Um, no, no, I apartments?" And he says, "Um, no, no, I don't think that'd be right. It's not don't think that'd be right. It's not right to tour another man's home." I right to tour another man's home." I admire that. admire that. admire that. Yeah, exactly. And it ends with him Yeah, exactly. And it ends with him giving this speech in Capitol Square in giving this speech in Capitol Square in Richmond to a generally black crowd, Richmond to a generally black crowd, again, freed slaves, and he says to again, freed slaves, and he says to them, "My poor friends, you are free, them, "My poor friends, you are free, free as air. You can cast off the name free as air. You can cast off the name of slave and trample upon it. It will of slave and trample upon it. It will come to you no more. Liberty is your come to you no more. Liberty is your birthright. God gave it to you as he birthright. God gave it to you as he gave it to others. It's a sin that you gave it to others. It's a sin that you have been deprived of it for so many have been deprived of it for so many years." And then he ends by saying, you years." And then he ends by saying, you know, learn the laws, be good citizens, know, learn the laws, be good citizens, obey God's commandments, thank him for obey God's commandments, thank him for giving you liberty, for to him you owe giving you liberty, for to him you owe all things. So very moving stuff. He all things. So very moving stuff. He stays in Richmond for another day and stays in Richmond for another day and then he tours the front and then on the then he tours the front and then on the 9th of April he um returns to Washington 9th of April he um returns to Washington DC and his mood at this point is a kind DC and his mood at this point is a kind of odd mixture. At times he's very giddy of odd mixture. At times he's very giddy almost with happiness, but then he can almost with happiness, but then he can be very melancholy. So when they're be very melancholy. So when they're sailing home on the river Queen, he sailing home on the river Queen, he actually reads a saliloquy from McBth to actually reads a saliloquy from McBth to his uh to his companions. Hard to his uh to his companions. Hard to imagine the current president doing imagine the current president doing that, I think. But it's so interesting, that, I think. But it's so interesting, isn't it? Because it's it's what is it isn't it? Because it's it's what is it in your notes? You say it's the silo in your notes? You say it's the silo queen McBTH delivers after he's murdered queen McBTH delivers after he's murdered Duncan. Yeah. So much blood. And that Duncan. Yeah. So much blood. And that must be expressive of a sense of guilt. must be expressive of a sense of guilt. I mean, McBth is consumed by guilt. I mean, McBth is consumed by guilt. Well, it's so interesting he would Well, it's so interesting he would choose that speech cuz MBTH is actually choose that speech cuz MBTH is actually saying at one point, I I I'm I'm so saying at one point, I I I'm I'm so troubled by guilt I envy Duncan who I've troubled by guilt I envy Duncan who I've killed who is now sleeping under the killed who is now sleeping under the sleep of the just. And I think Lincoln sleep of the just. And I think Lincoln absolutely feels that, you know, he's on absolutely feels that, you know, he's on this tour of the front. He's said again this tour of the front. He's said again and again how much he regrets the and again how much he regrets the bloodshed and the killing. You know, he bloodshed and the killing. You know, he doesn't glory in it. He doesn't glory in doesn't glory in it. He doesn't glory in victory. victory. victory. But it's more than that, isn't it, But it's more than that, isn't it, Surely? It's a sense of I mean maybe Surely? It's a sense of I mean maybe unrealized even by himself of worry unrealized even by himself of worry whether he has been the the tyrant of whether he has been the the tyrant of Confederate invective whether he has um Confederate invective whether he has um spilled the blood of Americans on the spilled the blood of Americans on the altar of his presidency. I don't know. altar of his presidency. I don't know. No, I think you're right, Tom. I think No, I think you're right, Tom. I think he I think everything we know about he I think everything we know about Lincoln suggests that he is a man who Lincoln suggests that he is a man who while ultimately a very effective while ultimately a very effective politician, very firm, decisive, all of politician, very firm, decisive, all of those things that he is an an intensely those things that he is an an intensely reflective person and there was also a reflective person and there was also a kind of hum I mean there is a kind of kind of hum I mean there is a kind of humility to him. I mean I don't want to humility to him. I mean I don't want to it to turn into a kind of Lincoln it to turn into a kind of Lincoln hagography but he is one of those hagography but he is one of those characters in history that you kind of characters in history that you kind of look for an opportunity to be look for an opportunity to be revisionist and actually there isn't revisionist and actually there isn't really one. Now the one thing I will say really one. Now the one thing I will say is the thing about McBth I think there is the thing about McBth I think there is a fatalism to Lincoln at this point. is a fatalism to Lincoln at this point. He has said many times to people I He has said many times to people I wonder if I will ever see the end of the wonder if I will ever see the end of the war whether I will live to see the end war whether I will live to see the end of it. He dream has dreams of his of it. He dream has dreams of his potential murder doesn't he? potential murder doesn't he? Exactly. So exactly he said to Harriet Exactly. So exactly he said to Harriet Beestowe however it ends I have the Beestowe however it ends I have the impression that I shan last long after impression that I shan last long after it is over. And actually at this point it is over. And actually at this point when he's reading that speech from McBth when he's reading that speech from McBth it is the 9th of April and he has only 5 it is the 9th of April and he has only 5 days to live. days to live. But actually, while he's on the boat, But actually, while he's on the boat, there is a very, very dramatic there is a very, very dramatic development. Um, elsewhere in Virginia development. Um, elsewhere in Virginia at Appamatics Courthouse, at Appamatics Courthouse, Robert E. Lee's army has been cornered Robert E. Lee's army has been cornered and trapped. They failed to break and trapped. They failed to break through the Union lines. And that through the Union lines. And that afternoon in a place called the Mlan afternoon in a place called the Mlan farmhouse. Lee signs the instrument of farmhouse. Lee signs the instrument of surrender. It's a scene we described surrender. It's a scene we described before, I think, in in our Kuster before, I think, in in our Kuster series. series. series. Yeah. Because he was there, wasn't he? Yeah. Because he was there, wasn't he? Yeah. Eli Parker, who was General Yeah. Eli Parker, who was General Grant's agitant, wrote out the document. Grant's agitant, wrote out the document. And when Lee found out that this bloke And when Lee found out that this bloke was a Senica Indian, he said, "Oh, it's was a Senica Indian, he said, "Oh, it's good to have one real American here." good to have one real American here." And an absolute Hollywood style, Parker And an absolute Hollywood style, Parker said, "Sir, we're all Americans." And said, "Sir, we're all Americans." And everyone clased their hand over the everyone clased their hand over the heart and burst into patriotic tears. heart and burst into patriotic tears. Everybody cries, but nobody more than Everybody cries, but nobody more than Tabby watching that in the film version, Tabby watching that in the film version, I think. Anyway, the next day, the 10th, I think. Anyway, the next day, the 10th, Lincoln is back in Washington. He's Lincoln is back in Washington. He's actually in great form and his advisers actually in great form and his advisers say, you know, they'd never seen him so say, you know, they'd never seen him so happy because he's heard the news. happy because he's heard the news. Cuz he's fun, isn't he? As well. He's Cuz he's fun, isn't he? As well. He's great sense of humor. So when he's when great sense of humor. So when he's when he's on a jig, he's he's all in. he's on a jig, he's he's all in. Exactly. He's a very he's an up and down Exactly. He's a very he's an up and down person. I think it's fair to say. When person. I think it's fair to say. When he's melancholy, he's very melancholy he's melancholy, he's very melancholy and when he's jolly, he's very jolly. and when he's jolly, he's very jolly. And um of course, he's got big And um of course, he's got big challenges now. Now they really have to challenges now. Now they really have to make up their mind what do they do with make up their mind what do they do with the rebel states. Now at the time, lots the rebel states. Now at the time, lots of people said, "Why don't you give a of people said, "Why don't you give a speech?" go on, everyone wants a speech. speech?" go on, everyone wants a speech. But he said, "No, no, I need a day to But he said, "No, no, I need a day to think about it." So, it's not until the think about it." So, it's not until the next day, the 11th of April, that next day, the 11th of April, that evening, with a huge crowd waiting evening, with a huge crowd waiting outside the White House, that he gives outside the White House, that he gives this speech. And very unusually, and this speech. And very unusually, and this is a sign, I think, of the this is a sign, I think, of the political pressure, he reads from a political pressure, he reads from a text. He doesn't deliver his remarks text. He doesn't deliver his remarks extemporary because he needs every word extemporary because he needs every word to be finely valued and graded. He says, to be finely valued and graded. He says, "I'm going to talk about reconstruction "I'm going to talk about reconstruction and sometimes I'm betrayed into saying and sometimes I'm betrayed into saying things that other people don't like." things that other people don't like." And he doesn't talk really at all about And he doesn't talk really at all about again no triumphalism. He says, "I would again no triumphalism. He says, "I would like us to welcome back the rebel states like us to welcome back the rebel states as though they were never out of the as though they were never out of the union." In other words, we're like union." In other words, we're like loving parents and we're welcoming the loving parents and we're welcoming the errant child back into the family. errant child back into the family. Well, the prodigal son, because I Well, the prodigal son, because I imagine that, you know, the language of imagine that, you know, the language of the New Testament is saturating his the New Testament is saturating his pros. pros. pros. But now comes the kicker. He for the But now comes the kicker. He for the very first time in public, Lincoln says, very first time in public, Lincoln says, "I think it is time to give the vote to "I think it is time to give the vote to some of our black fellow citizens." He some of our black fellow citizens." He says, "I would myself prefer that it says, "I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very were now conferred on the very intelligent and on those who serve our intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers." Now, that may sound cause as soldiers." Now, that may sound like only a small move, but that's how like only a small move, but that's how Lincoln always works. It's always he Lincoln always works. It's always he works with the sort of thin end of the works with the sort of thin end of the wedge. He's a gradualist. He's always wedge. He's a gradualist. He's always very exactly what he did with very exactly what he did with emancipation. He moves slowly but emancipation. He moves slowly but steadily towards a more radical steadily towards a more radical position. This is a a massive massive position. This is a a massive massive moment. And for one listener in the moment. And for one listener in the crowd in particular, these words are crowd in particular, these words are like a electric shock or something. And like a electric shock or something. And this bloke is a 26-year-old actor. And this bloke is a 26-year-old actor. And when he hears Lincoln say these words, when he hears Lincoln say these words, he turns to the man next to him in the he turns to the man next to him in the crowd and he says, "That means crowd and he says, "That means citizenship."

Baltimore 1855. Baltimore 1855. Everybody always said that Edwin the Everybody always said that Edwin the older brother was a kind of more nuanced older brother was a kind of more nuanced actor, more precise, but John Wilks, actor, more precise, but John Wilks, he's more vital. He's a he's boisterous. he's more vital. He's a he's boisterous. He's exciting. He's he's kind of Brian He's exciting. He's he's kind of Brian Blessed a little bit. Yeah, he's a bit Blessed a little bit. Yeah, he's a bit of a ham, but he's a fun ham. and he's a of a ham, but he's a fun ham. and he's a huge scene stealer and he will do he huge scene stealer and he will do he specializes in leaps and I I don't know specializes in leaps and I I don't know how much opportunities there is in how much opportunities there is in Shakespeare and saliloquist to do a Shakespeare and saliloquist to do a little little leap or caper or little little leap or caper or something. something. something. I mean leaping across a stage will be a I mean leaping across a stage will be a feature of the story later on, won't it? feature of the story later on, won't it? Exactly. And he does these leaps and Exactly. And he does these leaps and basically basically basically the women in the audience go mad with the women in the audience go mad with excitement when he does these kind of excitement when he does these kind of acrobatics and he gets loads of fan mail acrobatics and he gets loads of fan mail from women. And on the eve of the civil from women. And on the eve of the civil war, so 186061, war, so 186061, he's in his very early 20s and he is he's in his very early 20s and he is really seen as a I mean he's often really seen as a I mean he's often described actually as a failed actor or described actually as a failed actor or jobbing actor. He's quite a big star. I jobbing actor. He's quite a big star. I was wondering about this and and whether was wondering about this and and whether you could um give an analogy in today's you could um give an analogy in today's star system. So is I mean is he Timothy star system. So is I mean is he Timothy Shalamé? Is he a minor part on the Shalamé? Is he a minor part on the archers? I mean where is he on the archers? I mean where is he on the spectrum? spectrum? spectrum? Well Timothy Shalom is a very big star. Well Timothy Shalom is a very big star. Um, I don't know whether he's quite that Um, I don't know whether he's quite that big, but he's definitely bigger than a big, but he's definitely bigger than a bit part. bit part. bit part. He'd be a lead on a on a kind of HBO TV He'd be a lead on a on a kind of HBO TV series perhaps that that level. series perhaps that that level. I'd say he would he would be the lead in I'd say he would he would be the lead in uh Outlander. I had always bought into uh Outlander. I had always bought into this thing that he was a minor this thing that he was a minor frustrated actor who never got any jobs frustrated actor who never got any jobs or anything. And to realize that or anything. And to realize that actually he's been starring in an HBO actually he's been starring in an HBO series puts a completely different spin series puts a completely different spin on it. on it. on it. Yeah. He is the probably the most famous Yeah. He is the probably the most famous assassin in American history if you by assassin in American history if you by which I mean he's got a profile before which I mean he's got a profile before he commits the murder. he commits the murder. Right. Oh, he's totally got a profile. Right. Oh, he's totally got a profile. He has played Richard the Third, he's He has played Richard the Third, he's played Romeo. He's played Hamlet. He's played Romeo. He's played Hamlet. He's played Brutus. He's played Mark Anthony played Brutus. He's played Mark Anthony because it is often said that assassins because it is often said that assassins are losers, isn't it? I mean, we we are losers, isn't it? I mean, we we talked about this when we did the JFK talked about this when we did the JFK series, but in this case, it's not true. series, but in this case, it's not true. He is someone who is used to being on He is someone who is used to being on the stage and as we will see the the stage and as we will see the assassination will see him jump onto a assassination will see him jump onto a stage. stage. stage. Exactly. Although there are there are Exactly. Although there are there are aspects of his life in which he does aspects of his life in which he does feel himself very strongly to be a feel himself very strongly to be a loser. So he is a loser in a sense but loser. So he is a loser in a sense but you're right professionally you're right professionally he's he's had quite a good run. Now he's he's had quite a good run. Now interestingly interestingly interestingly his heartland is the north and the his heartland is the north and the border states and he did loads of shows border states and he did loads of shows in Washington and New York and in Washington and New York and Philadelphia and so on. in November Philadelphia and so on. in November 1863. Here's a good example, Tom, of how 1863. Here's a good example, Tom, of how he's a he is a star watched by very he's a he is a star watched by very famous people. He plays a villainous famous people. He plays a villainous ancient Greek sculptor ancient Greek sculptor in a play that's sadly not really in a play that's sadly not really endured. It's in the repertoire called endured. It's in the repertoire called The Marble Heart. Is it still around the The Marble Heart. Is it still around the script? I'm sure it is. I bet you can script? I'm sure it is. I bet you can find it somewhere if you want to play find it somewhere if you want to play it. The theater he plays at is called it. The theater he plays at is called Ford's Theater on 10th Street in Ford's Theater on 10th Street in Washington. And in the audience in the Washington. And in the audience in the box is Abraham Lincoln. And at various box is Abraham Lincoln. And at various points, Booth is delivering is when he's points, Booth is delivering is when he's not leaping, he's delivering these not leaping, he's delivering these menacing line, villainous lines, and he menacing line, villainous lines, and he aims them at the presidential box. And aims them at the presidential box. And Lincoln actually says to her friends, Lincoln actually says to her friends, "He does look pretty sharp at me, "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" Now, this is no accident doesn't he?" Now, this is no accident because Booth absolutely loathes because Booth absolutely loathes Lincoln. I said he was born in Maryland. Lincoln. I said he was born in Maryland. From the beginning of the crisis, both From the beginning of the crisis, both identified very strongly with the South. identified very strongly with the South. Maryland was a slave state where a lot Maryland was a slave state where a lot of people strongly supported the of people strongly supported the Confederacy, but it didn't break away Confederacy, but it didn't break away from the Union. So, it didn't join the from the Union. So, it didn't join the Confederate States. That's partly Confederate States. That's partly because the Union troops right away because the Union troops right away imposed martial law. It's also because imposed martial law. It's also because Lincoln suspended habius corpus. Lincoln suspended habius corpus. Maryland is a strategically vital. If Maryland is a strategically vital. If you lost that, you would lose you lost that, you would lose Washington. So, in union keeping it was Washington. So, in union keeping it was really, really important. Now Booth really, really important. Now Booth feels this feels this feels this very keenly and one reason he feels this very keenly and one reason he feels this very keenly he's he's he hates the fact very keenly he's he's he hates the fact that Maryland is part of the union is that Maryland is part of the union is because he is so racist. because he is so racist. He had actually drafted a speech in 1860 He had actually drafted a speech in 1860 when the crisis was really blowing up when the crisis was really blowing up and he planned to give it in and he planned to give it in Philadelphia but he never did. And in Philadelphia but he never did. And in this speech he said you know slavery is this speech he said you know slavery is brilliant. He said I've been through the brilliant. He said I've been through the South. Um I've seen how happy the slaves South. Um I've seen how happy the slaves are. Um, I have seen black people are. Um, I have seen black people whipped, but only when they really whipped, but only when they really deserved it and never as much as they deserved it and never as much as they deserved. And he says of abolitionists, deserved. And he says of abolitionists, um, I call them traitors. Treason should um, I call them traitors. Treason should be stamped to death. So deep is my be stamped to death. So deep is my hatred for such men, I wish I had them hatred for such men, I wish I had them in my grasp. And if I had the power to in my grasp. And if I had the power to crush them, I would grind them into crush them, I would grind them into dust. dust. dust. So he's he's very against the woke mind So he's he's very against the woke mind virus. virus. virus. He's very much against the woke mind He's very much against the woke mind virus. It's fair to say. Now, you might virus. It's fair to say. Now, you might well say, "Come on, mate. I mean, if you well say, "Come on, mate. I mean, if you really hate it that much, why don't you really hate it that much, why don't you actually go and fight for the actually go and fight for the Confederacy?" Confederacy?" Confederacy?" Good point. What's his answer? Good point. What's his answer? He's promised his mother that he He's promised his mother that he wouldn't. So, not only is he racist, but wouldn't. So, not only is he racist, but he's a racist mommy's boy. he's a racist mommy's boy. Yeah. He's a cowardly racist. The worst Yeah. He's a cowardly racist. The worst kind of coward and the worst kind of kind of coward and the worst kind of racist. I think it's fair to say. racist. I think it's fair to say. No, the worst kind of racist is racist No, the worst kind of racist is racist PE teachers. We agreed on that. PE teachers. We agreed on that. I think we did. Yeah. I think we did. Yeah. Yeah. But this is the second Yeah. But this is the second PE teachers and cowards is the reven PE teachers and cowards is the reven diagram there. I wonder. Um anyway, he diagram there. I wonder. Um anyway, he has he is such a massive mummies boy in has he is such a massive mummies boy in a really slightly weird way, which is a really slightly weird way, which is why despite being um very popular with why despite being um very popular with the ladies, he's never got married and the ladies, he's never got married and never, you know, he's never really never, you know, he's never really settled down. But as the war goes on, he settled down. But as the war goes on, he feels guilty about this. As the war goes feels guilty about this. As the war goes on, people say to him, you know, will on, people say to him, you know, will you stop talking about the war? Stop you stop talking about the war? Stop going on about how much you love the going on about how much you love the Confederacy, and if you like it that Confederacy, and if you like it that much, go and fight for it. Even his much, go and fight for it. Even his sister says this. Why not go and fight sister says this. Why not go and fight for her if you love the South so much? for her if you love the South so much? Every Marylander worthy of the name is Every Marylander worthy of the name is fighting her battles. And at one point fighting her battles. And at one point in late 1864, he says to his mom, "I've in late 1864, he says to his mom, "I've begun to deem myself a coward and to begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence." despise my own existence." So, um, all this time he's he's still So, um, all this time he's he's still doing his plays, is he? doing his plays, is he? He isn't. He's doing quite well. He He isn't. He's doing quite well. He actually genuinely is playing quite big actually genuinely is playing quite big parts and he's getting a lot of acclaim parts and he's getting a lot of acclaim and stuff, but and stuff, but he's unhappy. His family had a history he's unhappy. His family had a history of mental instability. His father was a of mental instability. His father was a massive wife beater. He's drinking massive wife beater. He's drinking loads. uh he's necking loads of brandy loads. uh he's necking loads of brandy and he can't sleep and I think a lot of and he can't sleep and I think a lot of this is actually because he feels so this is actually because he feels so guilty about the war and because the guilty about the war and because the news from the front is as he perceives news from the front is as he perceives it so bad. So basically every every it so bad. So basically every every battle the south lose he then drinks battle the south lose he then drinks like another gallon of brandy or like another gallon of brandy or something and he focuses all of this something and he focuses all of this rage and resentment on the figure of rage and resentment on the figure of Lincoln. So, a barber said afterwards Lincoln. So, a barber said afterwards that basically whenever Booth turned up that basically whenever Booth turned up for a shave, everyone would kind of sigh for a shave, everyone would kind of sigh and roll their eyes because basically and roll their eyes because basically for the next 10 minutes, he's going to for the next 10 minutes, he's going to treat them to a monologue about how treat them to a monologue about how terrible Lincoln is. He he said to his terrible Lincoln is. He he said to his sister, "That man's appearance, his sister, "That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse, low jokes and pedigree, his coarse, low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes and his anecdotes, his vulgar similes and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds." Not enough chat about Lincoln's holds." Not enough chat about Lincoln's low, vulgar jokes, I think. I mean it is low, vulgar jokes, I think. I mean it is interesting that there is clearly no interesting that there is clearly no notion of any censorship going on that notion of any censorship going on that you can badmouth the president in the you can badmouth the president in the depths of a terrible civil war and depths of a terrible civil war and people just slightly roll their eyes. So people just slightly roll their eyes. So any notion of Lincoln as a tyrant is any notion of Lincoln as a tyrant is clearly mad. Well as we will see you clearly mad. Well as we will see you know the nor some northern newspapers know the nor some northern newspapers are absolutely ferocious in their are absolutely ferocious in their effective against Abraham Lincoln. So effective against Abraham Lincoln. So and and actually this brings us to an and and actually this brings us to an important point. Booth loves a important point. Booth loves a historical analogy. So do we. So that is historical analogy. So do we. So that is an unsettling point of comparison. an unsettling point of comparison. To be fair, Tom, the hammy acting. To be fair, Tom, the hammy acting. There's a lot of there's a lot I didn't There's a lot of there's a lot I didn't want to go into the parallels, but want to go into the parallels, but they're pretty they're pretty they're pretty overwhelming. First of all, he sees overwhelming. First of all, he sees Lincoln as an American Napoleon, and he Lincoln as an American Napoleon, and he does not mean that kindly. So he says to does not mean that kindly. So he says to his sister in 1864, "Lincoln rules by his sister in 1864, "Lincoln rules by robbery, raping, slaughter, and bought robbery, raping, slaughter, and bought armies. He is bone apart in one great armies. He is bone apart in one great move that is by overturning this blind move that is by overturning this blind republic and making himself a king. republic and making himself a king. And Dominic, can I ask is there another And Dominic, can I ask is there another figure from world history who is uh figure from world history who is uh accused by his fellow citizens in a accused by his fellow citizens in a republic of trying to make himself a republic of trying to make himself a king? king? king? There is. And this will please that There is. And this will please that bloke on the Reddit. It's Julius Caesar. bloke on the Reddit. It's Julius Caesar. Brilliant. Right. Brilliant. Right. Brilliant. Right. So, um Booth actually writes a letter So, um Booth actually writes a letter when he's made up his mind to do this when he's made up his mind to do this dastardly deed. He writes a letter to dastardly deed. He writes a letter to the newspapers for publication which is the newspapers for publication which is never printed. And he says specifically never printed. And he says specifically says Lincoln is like Caesar who menaced says Lincoln is like Caesar who menaced the liberties of the people and I am the liberties of the people and I am like Brutus who arose and slew him. Now like Brutus who arose and slew him. Now Michael Berlingame in his enormous Michael Berlingame in his enormous Lincoln book has a really interesting Lincoln book has a really interesting section about what a popular analogy section about what a popular analogy this is at the time. It's still a this is at the time. It's still a popular analogy. I think we've talked popular analogy. I think we've talked about this that in a republic that is about this that in a republic that is modeled on the the Roman Republic, modeled on the the Roman Republic, everyone is absolutely prone to see any everyone is absolutely prone to see any presidential figure as potentially a presidential figure as potentially a Caesar. Although surely much more so at Caesar. Although surely much more so at a time when all the opinion formers, a time when all the opinion formers, politicians and whatnot have had such a politicians and whatnot have had such a classical education of course and also classical education of course and also in a civil war which is how Caesar comes in a civil war which is how Caesar comes to power. Now in the southern newspapers to power. Now in the southern newspapers often use this parallel. So, you asked, often use this parallel. So, you asked, "Are Southerners calling for Lincoln's "Are Southerners calling for Lincoln's assassination?" The Richmond Dispatch assassination?" The Richmond Dispatch said, and I quote, "Assenation in the said, and I quote, "Assenation in the abstract is a horrid crime, but to slay abstract is a horrid crime, but to slay a tyrant is no more assassination than a tyrant is no more assassination than war is murder. Who speaks of Brutus as war is murder. Who speaks of Brutus as an assassin? What Yankee ever condemned an assassin? What Yankee ever condemned the Roundhead crew who brought Charles I the Roundhead crew who brought Charles I to the block?" So it's not just Caesar, to the block?" So it's not just Caesar, he's Charles the first. And Michael he's Charles the first. And Michael Berlingame points out that in the north Berlingame points out that in the north as well, and this is your point about as well, and this is your point about censorship, Tom, Lincoln's critics often censorship, Tom, Lincoln's critics often compare him with Julius Caesar. So in compare him with Julius Caesar. So in May 1863, so these are Democrats and May 1863, so these are Democrats and some radical Republicans actually who some radical Republicans actually who think that Lincoln is, you know, too too think that Lincoln is, you know, too too much of a centrist dad. They say he's a much of a centrist dad. They say he's a tyrant and he's piling up power and tyrant and he's piling up power and whatnot. So in May 1863 at a New York whatnot. So in May 1863 at a New York college called the Cooper Union, a college called the Cooper Union, a speaker said in public, "Let us remind speaker said in public, "Let us remind Lincoln that Caesar had his Brutus and Lincoln that Caesar had his Brutus and Charles I his Cromwell. Let us also Charles I his Cromwell. Let us also remind the George II of the present day remind the George II of the present day that he too may have his Cromwell or his that he too may have his Cromwell or his Brutus." Dominic just two questions. The Brutus." Dominic just two questions. The first I have lurking in the back of my first I have lurking in the back of my mind uh it I think I read an article mind uh it I think I read an article about um bioteterrorism through history about um bioteterrorism through history that there was there was some guy who that there was there was some guy who sent Lincoln a load of clothes that he sent Lincoln a load of clothes that he tried to infect with yellow fever or tried to infect with yellow fever or something. Yeah. His name was Dr. Luke something. Yeah. His name was Dr. Luke P. Blackburn and um he was from P. Blackburn and um he was from Kentucky. He was a Confederate agent. Kentucky. He was a Confederate agent. I'm laughing because actually I've just I'm laughing because actually I've just Googled it so I don't actually really Googled it so I don't actually really know this. Um he uh yes he was going to know this. Um he uh yes he was going to distribute infected clothing with yellow distribute infected clothing with yellow fever and um slightly slightly weirdly fever and um slightly slightly weirdly it's it's the soiled it's it's the soiled the soiled what it was the soiled the soiled what it was the soiled bedding of people from Bermuda I think bedding of people from Bermuda I think that's unpleasant and but apparently it that's unpleasant and but apparently it wouldn't have worked because yellow wouldn't have worked because yellow fever spreads um via mosquitoes fever spreads um via mosquitoes he went on a very long journey he had to he went on a very long journey he had to go through through Canada so multiple go through through Canada so multiple customs inspections customs inspections customs inspections with his soiled with his soiled so his soiled bed linen. Wow. Well, so so his soiled bed linen. Wow. Well, so that was your first question. What was that was your first question. What was your second? your second? your second? My second question is what kind of My second question is what kind of security does Lincoln have? So So security does Lincoln have? So So presumably there isn't a kind of presumably there isn't a kind of national security service at this point. national security service at this point. There aren't loads of people in suits There aren't loads of people in suits with dark glasses. with dark glasses. Well, actually, we will get on to this, Well, actually, we will get on to this, Tom. I'm I'm I'm delighted to say he has Tom. I'm I'm I'm delighted to say he has virtually no security at all. He doesn't virtually no security at all. He doesn't want security. He doesn't like want security. He doesn't like bodyguards. bodyguards. bodyguards. It's not federally provided. No. So he It's not federally provided. No. So he has to basically provide it for himself has to basically provide it for himself pretty much. Exactly. Pretty much. Yeah. pretty much. Exactly. Pretty much. Yeah. Now you ask about security. John Wils Now you ask about security. John Wils Booth's first idea is actually to kidnap Booth's first idea is actually to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. By 1864, Lincoln, not to kill him. By 1864, um Booth has developed this plan to um Booth has developed this plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer cottage kidnap Lincoln from his summer cottage outside Washington. Now the details of outside Washington. Now the details of this plan are a little bit unclear, but this plan are a little bit unclear, but what seems to have happened is Booth what seems to have happened is Booth thought he could kidnap Lincoln and thought he could kidnap Lincoln and exchange him for Confederate prisoners exchange him for Confederate prisoners of war. That seems a mad waste if you've of war. That seems a mad waste if you've kidnapped the leader of the one of the kidnapped the leader of the one of the the combatants just to hand him over in the combatants just to hand him over in exchange for them prisoners of war is I exchange for them prisoners of war is I think is demented. Some historians think think is demented. Some historians think this is actually part of a wider this is actually part of a wider Confederate conspiracy. The Confederates Confederate conspiracy. The Confederates had a lot of spies in Washington and had a lot of spies in Washington and secret agents hanging around. One of secret agents hanging around. One of them is a man called John Serat who them is a man called John Serat who definitely worked for the Confederate definitely worked for the Confederate secret service and his mother Mary Serat secret service and his mother Mary Serat will come on to her. She ran a boarding will come on to her. She ran a boarding house in Washington which was a safe house in Washington which was a safe house for Confederate agents. And Booth house for Confederate agents. And Booth seems to have been connected with these seems to have been connected with these people. And he has this scheme that people. And he has this scheme that they're going to kidnap Lincoln on the they're going to kidnap Lincoln on the road then take him off into captivity. road then take him off into captivity. And as late as March 1865, he's got a And as late as March 1865, he's got a group of kind of hangers on and he's group of kind of hangers on and he's chatting to them all the time about this chatting to them all the time about this kidnap scheme, but it doesn't really kidnap scheme, but it doesn't really come to anything. There's one day when come to anything. There's one day when they do actually go, but Lincoln doesn't they do actually go, but Lincoln doesn't turn up. So whether they could have turn up. So whether they could have pulled it off, who knows? Then in early pulled it off, who knows? Then in early April 1865, Booth hears the news of the April 1865, Booth hears the news of the fall of Richmond and then of Robert El fall of Richmond and then of Robert El Le's surrender and he is absolutely Le's surrender and he is absolutely crushed. And I think this is the point crushed. And I think this is the point when he comes up with the idea of when he comes up with the idea of killing Lincoln rather than kidnapping killing Lincoln rather than kidnapping him. And there's another element to him. And there's another element to this. You asked if he was a loser. What this. You asked if he was a loser. What is undoubtedly true is that John Wils is undoubtedly true is that John Wils Booth feels himself to be a failure and Booth feels himself to be a failure and is motivated by a thirst for fame.

President Lincoln." and he's bringing Ulyses Srant Lincoln." and he's bringing Ulyses Srant with him and Booth apparently showed no with him and Booth apparently showed no reaction at the time. He just sat down reaction at the time. He just sat down and started looking at his post. But and started looking at his post. But clearly he's thinking because in the clearly he's thinking because in the next few hours he does three things. next few hours he does three things. First of all, he goes to see a bloke who First of all, he goes to see a bloke who runs a stable near the theater, a man runs a stable near the theater, a man called Mr. Pumprey. And he hires a brown called Mr. Pumprey. And he hires a brown horse, a mare with a white star on her horse, a mare with a white star on her forehead. He says, "I I'll come back for forehead. He says, "I I'll come back for this horse later. Hold on to the horse this horse later. Hold on to the horse for the time being." Then he goes to for the time being." Then he goes to that Confederate lodging house, the safe that Confederate lodging house, the safe house run by Mary Serat, and he talks to house run by Mary Serat, and he talks to her in private, and he gives her a her in private, and he gives her a package. Later, she goes out of the city package. Later, she goes out of the city to a tavern that she owns in the to a tavern that she owns in the countryside in Maryland, and she leaves countryside in Maryland, and she leaves this package there. We'll come back to this package there. We'll come back to the package in the next episode. And the package in the next episode. And then third thing, at some point in the then third thing, at some point in the afternoon, Booth contacts three of the afternoon, Booth contacts three of the sort of hangers on who he'd been talking sort of hangers on who he'd been talking about the kidnap plot to, and he makes about the kidnap plot to, and he makes arrangements for the evening. And these arrangements for the evening. And these three BS are there's a a carriage repair three BS are there's a a carriage repair man from Germany called George Azeroth. man from Germany called George Azeroth. There's a pharmacist's assistant from There's a pharmacist's assistant from Maryland called David Herald. And Maryland called David Herald. And there's a former Confederate soldier there's a former Confederate soldier who's now working as a Confederate agent who's now working as a Confederate agent called Lewis Powell. And Tom, I will called Lewis Powell. And Tom, I will keep it in reserve what these keep it in reserve what these arrangements are. So now we come to the arrangements are. So now we come to the evening. The White House, the Lincoln evening. The White House, the Lincoln have had their dinner. They're about to have had their dinner. They're about to go out to the theater. They're delayed go out to the theater. They're delayed because the speaker of the House of because the speaker of the House of Representatives who has their excellent Representatives who has their excellent American name of Shila Kulfax is waiting American name of Shila Kulfax is waiting to talk to him about California. And to talk to him about California. And Dominic, it's fair to say, isn't it, Dominic, it's fair to say, isn't it, that from this point on, uh, fans of mad that from this point on, uh, fans of mad 19th century American names are going to 19th century American names are going to be in Clover. Yeah, because there's be in Clover. Yeah, because there's loads of them coming up. There is. And loads of them coming up. There is. And there's actually a lot of people I've there's actually a lot of people I've cut out of the story who, um, people cut out of the story who, um, people could kind of furow weed or something could kind of furow weed or something like mad American names I've had to cut like mad American names I've had to cut out. So, just assume that basically out. So, just assume that basically assume that in the background are a lot assume that in the background are a lot of people with these Barack ridiculous of people with these Barack ridiculous names. So about 8:30 after talking to names. So about 8:30 after talking to Shila Kfax, uh the Lincoln are ready to Shila Kfax, uh the Lincoln are ready to leave. Now the plan has changed. Ulyses leave. Now the plan has changed. Ulyses Srant has been so burned by his previous Srant has been so burned by his previous encounters with Mrs. Lincoln that he encounters with Mrs. Lincoln that he says there is no way I am going to the says there is no way I am going to the theater with these people. theater with these people. So Ulyses Sgrant was meant to be going So Ulyses Sgrant was meant to be going on the night that Lincoln is on the night that Lincoln is assassinated. Drops out. Do people not assassinated. Drops out. Do people not find this suspicious? I mean conspiracy find this suspicious? I mean conspiracy theorists. theorists. theorists. Gosh, that's a that's a good point. Gosh, that's a that's a good point. Does anyone think Grant was perhaps Does anyone think Grant was perhaps behind the plot? clear Lincoln out of behind the plot? clear Lincoln out of the way so he could in the due course the way so he could in the due course become president. I love the idea that become president. I love the idea that you've invented a conspiracy theory live you've invented a conspiracy theory live while recording a show. while recording a show. Wow. Uh I've never heard that claim. I Wow. Uh I've never heard that claim. I find that quite suspicious. So the other find that quite suspicious. So the other person who doesn't go who hates Mrs. person who doesn't go who hates Mrs. Lincoln is Julia Grant. She says she Lincoln is Julia Grant. She says she says to Grant, "I will not go if that says to Grant, "I will not go if that woman is there." Does this not raise the woman is there." Does this not raise the possibility that the bullet was meant possibility that the bullet was meant for Mary Lincoln and actually it's Mrs. for Mary Lincoln and actually it's Mrs. Grant who's behind the conspiracy? That Grant who's behind the conspiracy? That would be a twist. would be a twist. That is a twist. So, they don't go. Um, That is a twist. So, they don't go. Um, now Lincoln says, "Oh, if they're not now Lincoln says, "Oh, if they're not going, I don't really want to go." And going, I don't really want to go." And Mary says, "You have to go. The press Mary says, "You have to go. The press hear that you're going, and if none of hear that you're going, and if none of us go, they'll be everyone will be us go, they'll be everyone will be really disappointed." She says, "Anyway, really disappointed." She says, "Anyway, I've lined up some replacements." My I've lined up some replacements." My friend, Claraara Harris, she does have a friend, Claraara Harris, she does have a friend. She does have a friend, which is friend. She does have a friend, which is lovely.

And Claraara Harris has Claraara Harris. And Claraara Harris has her fiance, who's Major Henry Wthbone. her fiance, who's Major Henry Wthbone. So, they're going to take these two So, they're going to take these two people. Now, you asked about security. people. Now, you asked about security. There is very very little security. They There is very very little security. They are escorted to the theater by a police are escorted to the theater by a police patrol man called John Parker and a patrol man called John Parker and a White House messenger called Charles White House messenger called Charles Forbes. But they're not professional Forbes. But they're not professional bodyguards. Lincoln never travels with bodyguards. Lincoln never travels with professional bodyguards. He has said professional bodyguards. He has said many times, "I will not be shut up in an many times, "I will not be shut up in an iron cage." Now, he says when people say iron cage." Now, he says when people say to him, "Do you not want to be careful? to him, "Do you not want to be careful? You're fighting a civil war." He says, You're fighting a civil war." He says, "Who would want to kill me? No one would "Who would want to kill me? No one would want to kill me. It's not in people's want to kill me. It's not in people's nature to want to kill me." Now, that nature to want to kill me." Now, that would seem mad to us today, but the fact would seem mad to us today, but the fact is that at the time, there's never been is that at the time, there's never been a successful assassination in American a successful assassination in American history. And Lincoln's own Secretary of history. And Lincoln's own Secretary of State, William Seard, said in 1862, State, William Seard, said in 1862, "Assenation is not an American practice "Assenation is not an American practice or habit, and one so vicious and so or habit, and one so vicious and so desperate cannot be engrafted into our desperate cannot be engrafted into our political system."
