Welcome to the rest of this politics Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me Rory Stewart question time with me Rory Stewart and me Alistister Campbell and Rory as and me Alistister Campbell and Rory as we're recording my phone is pinging away we're recording my phone is pinging away with messages about the European with messages about the European Commission ratifying the onein one out Commission ratifying the onein one out deal as it became called that President deal as it became called that President Macarron and Karma struck at the UK Macarron and Karma struck at the UK France summit recently which looks very France summit recently which looks very very interesting because I I think I very interesting because I I think I said at the time I thought there'd be said at the time I thought there'd be problems in getting the whole of the problems in getting the whole of the European union to buy this, but it seems European union to buy this, but it seems like they are. like they are. I mean, this is a deal which we've been I mean, this is a deal which we've been talking about the shapes of for months talking about the shapes of for months and I've been very very interested in and I've been very very interested in because as we picked up with my slightly because as we picked up with my slightly unfortunate, grumpy, regrettable unfortunate, grumpy, regrettable encounter with Gabriel Latal, your encounter with Gabriel Latal, your friend, the former French prime friend, the former French prime minister. I really have felt for a long minister. I really have felt for a long time that it's ridiculous that people time that it's ridiculous that people are coming from France, the UK on boats are coming from France, the UK on boats in this way because France is a safe in this way because France is a safe country and that we should have had a country and that we should have had a very clear deal saying that if people very clear deal saying that if people arrived, we would send them back to arrived, we would send them back to France and that in return we should be France and that in return we should be taking genuine asylum seekers, you know, taking genuine asylum seekers, you know, female judges fleeing the Taliban, for female judges fleeing the Taliban, for example, and bringing them to Britain. example, and bringing them to Britain. And it's really good, I think, that And it's really good, I think, that they've put the framework of that they've put the framework of that together. Again, the devil's in the together. Again, the devil's in the detail. How many are they going to do? detail. How many are they going to do? how long is this going to last and can how long is this going to last and can they put this into a European framework they put this into a European framework but it's definitely I think but it's definitely I think philosophically the right idea they may philosophically the right idea they may be screwing up implementation be screwing up implementation the reason why I thought that this might the reason why I thought that this might fall apart at the European level is fall apart at the European level is because some of the particularly the the because some of the particularly the the countries that are really badly affected countries that are really badly affected in different ways uh Italy, in different ways uh Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus to some extent Greece, Spain, Cyprus to some extent that they would have thought hold on a that they would have thought hold on a minute why is France doing a bilateral minute why is France doing a bilateral deal to deal to deal to those people have gone to Britain coming those people have gone to Britain coming back to France which is the European back to France which is the European Union therefore they could end up on our Union therefore they could end up on our door as well but anyway whatever has door as well but anyway whatever has happened within the European Union happened within the European Union debate that seems to have been resolved debate that seems to have been resolved and also another shout out for Jeremy and also another shout out for Jeremy Hunt he did make another interesting Hunt he did make another interesting observation he said you know when Labour observation he said you know when Labour came in they didn't say this is going to came in they didn't say this is going to be really difficult really complicated be really difficult really complicated it's going to take time to sort they it's going to take time to sort they said we're going to smash the gangs so said we're going to smash the gangs so even as you and I keep saying we're even as you and I keep saying we're talking about relatively small numbers talking about relatively small numbers within the whole immigration picture within the whole immigration picture We're talking about something We're talking about something politically that Labour have to crack politically that Labour have to crack for this week because you announced you for this week because you announced you were going to Colia. We actually got a were going to Colia. We actually got a lot of questions about Colombia. lot of questions about Colombia. Felicity Anderson here, very Felicity Anderson here, very straightforward. Rory, welcome back. I straightforward. Rory, welcome back. I echo that. Felicity says, "I'd love to echo that. Felicity says, "I'd love to hear your reflections on Colombia, hear your reflections on Colombia, politics, people. What are your key politics, people. What are your key takeaways?" takeaways?" takeaways?" Oh, well, I think the first thing is Oh, well, I think the first thing is that of course Colombia still has some that of course Colombia still has some very, very serious trouble and we can very, very serious trouble and we can talk about that. There are armed talk about that. There are armed insurgents. There's a lot of cocoa insurgents. There's a lot of cocoa growing for the cocaine industry and growing for the cocaine industry and there's a big judicial fight going on there's a big judicial fight going on with the former president, the kind of with the former president, the kind of legendary former president now um being legendary former president now um being convicted in court. But as a place to convicted in court. But as a place to visit, it's really really lovely. I visit, it's really really lovely. I mean, you have to be careful where you mean, you have to be careful where you go, but we went to Cartahena, which is go, but we went to Cartahena, which is this incredible this incredible this incredible ancient colonial walled city on the ancient colonial walled city on the Atlantic coast. We went to the beach. We Atlantic coast. We went to the beach. We went to Bogatar, which is right up in went to Bogatar, which is right up in the Andes, and and climbed up to the top the Andes, and and climbed up to the top of a hill where you're at 3,300 m, so of a hill where you're at 3,300 m, so 10,000 ft in the air. But most 10,000 ft in the air. But most interesting of all, we went to U interesting of all, we went to U Macarena. And Macarena is down in the Macarena. And Macarena is down in the savannah, the Lanos of the the the savannah, the Lanos of the the the southern lands. And it was an area where southern lands. And it was an area where until relatively recently was basically until relatively recently was basically controlled by a guerilla group. In fact, controlled by a guerilla group. In fact, formally in 99200, formally in 99200, the government briefly granted the whole the government briefly granted the whole area to this gorilla group. The area to this gorilla group. The Colombian government backed off and FARC Colombian government backed off and FARC ran the area. And so all the time when ran the area. And so all the time when you're traveling and traveling with the you're traveling and traveling with the kids, you saw all this infrastructure kids, you saw all this infrastructure which had been built by the gorillas. which had been built by the gorillas. You know, the bridge had been built by You know, the bridge had been built by the gorillas. The initial landing strip the gorillas. The initial landing strip had been built by the gorillas. There had been built by the gorillas. There was a gorilla radio station. And it was was a gorilla radio station. And it was an area where this leftist group which an area where this leftist group which had emerged from the uh civil war of the had emerged from the uh civil war of the 40s and 50s in Colombia and was arguing 40s and 50s in Colombia and was arguing for a particular kind of vision of for a particular kind of vision of communist revolution communist revolution communist revolution different to other groups and there are different to other groups and there are nine different armed groups in Colombia nine different armed groups in Colombia currently having peace negotiations. But currently having peace negotiations. But this group controlled the area. It was this group controlled the area. It was almost impossible to get to. Colombia is almost impossible to get to. Colombia is 50 million people but the terrain is 50 million people but the terrain is unbelievably challenging. As I say, you unbelievably challenging. As I say, you go from these 10,000 ft hills to the go from these 10,000 ft hills to the Amazon rainforest and bits uh coastal Amazon rainforest and bits uh coastal regions and this huge savannah. You regions and this huge savannah. You simply couldn't get to it. This area was simply couldn't get to it. This area was first spotted from a plane in the in the first spotted from a plane in the in the 1940s and settled in the ' 40s. They 1940s and settled in the ' 40s. They just used it for massive cocoa just used it for massive cocoa production and then they began working production and then they began working with the great cartels. People would with the great cartels. People would have heard of Pabo Escobar who was have heard of Pabo Escobar who was killed in the '90s. that the Cari and killed in the '90s. that the Cari and Medeline cartels worked with the gorilla Medeline cartels worked with the gorilla groups initially so that the cocoa groups initially so that the cocoa production was got there and I I saw the production was got there and I I saw the places where the cocoa had been places where the cocoa had been transported and processed and then transported and processed and then fights began between those groups. So fights began between those groups. So then you had paramilitaries emerging then you had paramilitaries emerging which were often working for the land which were often working for the land owners or for the drug lords against uh owners or for the drug lords against uh the old leftist gerillas. Anyway, back the old leftist gerillas. Anyway, back over to you. What's your sense of over to you. What's your sense of Columbia? I've only ever been to Bogatar Columbia? I've only ever been to Bogatar and that was when I was trying to help and that was when I was trying to help Jonathan Powell who was um supporting Jonathan Powell who was um supporting Santos then the president in the first Santos then the president in the first of all the referendum which he lost but of all the referendum which he lost but then actually did manage to kind of then actually did manage to kind of bring the whole civil war to an end and bring the whole civil war to an end and and got the Nobel Peace Prize for his and got the Nobel Peace Prize for his success. Um fascinating place. I found success. Um fascinating place. I found the people the people the people really smart, really interesting, really smart, really interesting, very hard to get away from talking about very hard to get away from talking about drugs and I know that irritates them. drugs and I know that irritates them. But we also had a question here from But we also had a question here from from somebody called Yonas who wanted to from somebody called Yonas who wanted to know what we thought about Colombia know what we thought about Colombia specifically with the what's happening specifically with the what's happening in the drugs trade. And I'm afraid it's in the drugs trade. And I'm afraid it's not as happy a story as the ending of not as happy a story as the ending of the civil war because I read a wonderful the civil war because I read a wonderful piece while you were away by a guy piece while you were away by a guy called Cesar Alvarez who's a lecture in called Cesar Alvarez who's a lecture in terrorism and security and it starts by terrorism and security and it starts by saying imagine an area larger than the saying imagine an area larger than the Australian capital territory twice the Australian capital territory twice the size of London four times that of New size of London four times that of New York City covered in cocoa plantations. York City covered in cocoa plantations. That is the scale of Colombia's cocoa That is the scale of Colombia's cocoa cultivation according to the United cultivation according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. and Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. and Santos, for whom I have a lot of time Santos, for whom I have a lot of time and a lot of respect, it's funny and a lot of respect, it's funny sometimes how things that you think are sometimes how things that you think are going to work for you can end up being going to work for you can end up being counterproductive. So, two things. In counterproductive. So, two things. In 2015, 2015, 2015, the Colombian courts suspended the Colombian courts suspended some of the herbicides that were used to some of the herbicides that were used to kill cocoa because of the concern for kill cocoa because of the concern for health and environment. And then a year health and environment. And then a year later, Santos introduced a scheme where later, Santos introduced a scheme where basically you incentivize farmers, you basically you incentivize farmers, you paid farmers to grow non-illicit plants. paid farmers to grow non-illicit plants. And the trouble with that is that these And the trouble with that is that these very clever people, the Colombians, they very clever people, the Colombians, they thought, "Oh, so maybe if we start thought, "Oh, so maybe if we start growing cocoa, we'll start qualifying growing cocoa, we'll start qualifying for some of these these new subsidies." for some of these these new subsidies." So, actually, the cocoa crops doubled So, actually, the cocoa crops doubled during his second term. And the the during his second term. And the the cocaine has really taken off in a you cocaine has really taken off in a you know right across Europe, right across know right across Europe, right across parts of Australia's got a real cocaine parts of Australia's got a real cocaine problem. So I think it's a very very problem. So I think it's a very very very mixed picture. I mean you were no very mixed picture. I mean you were no Rory an opium man famously. But did you Rory an opium man famously. But did you see much of the drug stuff going on? see much of the drug stuff going on? This area I was in um was an area that This area I was in um was an area that was very much a traditional drug area was very much a traditional drug area and I was I I saw cocoa plants and I and I was I I saw cocoa plants and I chewed a cocoa leaf in order to make chewed a cocoa leaf in order to make sure that I can horrify the Daily sure that I can horrify the Daily Telegraph even more. But of course, all Telegraph even more. But of course, all this is hugely ringing bells with me this is hugely ringing bells with me from many painful years in Afghanistan, from many painful years in Afghanistan, uh, looking at poppy production and uh, looking at poppy production and heroin, which was very much a similar heroin, which was very much a similar story. Could you spray it? Could you story. Could you spray it? Could you turn off the water? Should you be paying turn off the water? Should you be paying farmers to grow things that weren't farmers to grow things that weren't poppy? It's an amazing guy called David poppy? It's an amazing guy called David Mansfield I worked with there. And what Mansfield I worked with there. And what he discovered is that of course it is he discovered is that of course it is possible for farmers to make good legal possible for farmers to make good legal incomes, but it's quite complicated. So incomes, but it's quite complicated. So if a farmer for example in central if a farmer for example in central Afghanistan doesn't grow poppy but Afghanistan doesn't grow poppy but instead has a mixed crop you know some instead has a mixed crop you know some apricots some wheat it can free up apricots some wheat it can free up family labor they can go into the town family labor they can go into the town they can earn some additional income you they can earn some additional income you can put a family income together that is can put a family income together that is higher but it's often quite higher but it's often quite geographically specific geographically specific geographically specific and of course security plays into this I and of course security plays into this I mean if it's not illegal or in in effect mean if it's not illegal or in in effect the police don't do anything about it it the police don't do anything about it it is a cash crop and of course the drug is a cash crop and of course the drug lords are able to put huge pressure on lords are able to put huge pressure on you if you you don't fight. I mean, you if you you don't fight. I mean, Gustavo Pro, who is the new president, Gustavo Pro, who is the new president, is coming up for election in a year's is coming up for election in a year's time. time. time. And he's their first ever leftwing And he's their first ever leftwing president, isn't he? president, isn't he? That's right. And the first ever proper That's right. And the first ever proper populist. populist. populist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Colombia is quite interesting. I mean, Colombia is quite interesting. It's the third largest population, third It's the third largest population, third largest economy in in Latin America and largest economy in in Latin America and uh after Brazil and Mexico. So, it's a uh after Brazil and Mexico. So, it's a really important place and it stretches really important place and it stretches all the way across, you imagine, all the way across, you imagine, geographically, from the Pacific to the geographically, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, just sitting below the Panama Atlantic, just sitting below the Panama Canal. And it's the strongest democracy Canal. And it's the strongest democracy traditionally in Latin America. I mean traditionally in Latin America. I mean it it didn't have military dictatorship it it didn't have military dictatorship when other people did. So on the one when other people did. So on the one hand there's this very strong story. hand there's this very strong story. It's place where Gabriel Garcia Marquez It's place where Gabriel Garcia Marquez is from. Botra the painter. So it's it's is from. Botra the painter. So it's it's it's a amazingly cultured educated place it's a amazingly cultured educated place on the one hand. On the other hand no on the one hand. On the other hand no roads through a lot of the country. I roads through a lot of the country. I mean if if you went to Macarenus where mean if if you went to Macarenus where where I was just with the family, if you where I was just with the family, if you had been there uh 7 years ago, it would had been there uh 7 years ago, it would take you something like 3 hours to go 15 take you something like 3 hours to go 15 km cuz there's basically no interest. km cuz there's basically no interest. You can't get anywhere. You you're You can't get anywhere. You you're dependent on it. It's got one of the dependent on it. It's got one of the oldest uh airlines in the world, oldest uh airlines in the world, Colombia, because the only way to get Colombia, because the only way to get anywhere is to anywhere is to is to land on these small landing is to land on these small landing strips. And I was hearing a a not a strips. And I was hearing a a not a podcast I necessarily would recommend podcast I necessarily would recommend for the general listener, but it was on for the general listener, but it was on the details of what Petro is trying to the details of what Petro is trying to do with the armed groups. And e even I do with the armed groups. And e even I trying to mug up for this podcast lost trying to mug up for this podcast lost the will to live. I mean, he's trying to the will to live. I mean, he's trying to conduct simultaneous peace negotiations conduct simultaneous peace negotiations with nine different armed groups. And as with nine different armed groups. And as you can imagine, there's a difference you can imagine, there's a difference between the Bolivar army, the ELN, between the Bolivar army, the ELN, who turns out to be, it seems, with more who turns out to be, it seems, with more of a Castroche Guavara route compared to of a Castroche Guavara route compared to the FARC that had a non-Castrocommunist the FARC that had a non-Castrocommunist route on the Venezuelan border. There's route on the Venezuelan border. There's now not an extraordinary combination of now not an extraordinary combination of cocoa growing and Venezuelan refugees cocoa growing and Venezuelan refugees coming in. And the government sent in coming in. And the government sent in 10,000 troops to try to deal with it, 10,000 troops to try to deal with it, and that didn't work out. And all this and that didn't work out. And all this is overlaid because this is the modern is overlaid because this is the modern world with very progressive world with very progressive conversations about gender inclusivity, conversations about gender inclusivity, civil society, civil society, civil society, uh, indigenous action, but which seems uh, indigenous action, but which seems to be often an alibi for incredible to be often an alibi for incredible amounts of paperwork, bureaucrats, a amounts of paperwork, bureaucrats, a huge civil service of peacemakers which huge civil service of peacemakers which aren't making much progress. I mean, aren't making much progress. I mean, Petra is under huge pressure because the Petra is under huge pressure because the country is in in danger of going down. country is in in danger of going down. And in the middle of this, we've got And in the middle of this, we've got another repeat of what we talked about another repeat of what we talked about yesterday, which is the great yesterday, which is the great charismatic former president Urebe who charismatic former president Urebe who with the US with billions of dollars of with the US with billions of dollars of American money and American military American money and American military crushed the FARC before the Santos peace crushed the FARC before the Santos peace deal. So one of the reasons the Santos deal. So one of the reasons the Santos peace deal worked is that he went very peace deal worked is that he went very aggressively with huge human rights aggressively with huge human rights abuses against them abuses against them and then didn't support the peace deal and then didn't support the peace deal and then turned against the peace deal. and then turned against the peace deal. turned against Santos, his former turned against Santos, his former defense minister, because he thought it defense minister, because he thought it was too soft. He was very close to the was too soft. He was very close to the paramilitary, and this case is basically paramilitary, and this case is basically saying that he was connected to illegal saying that he was connected to illegal paramilitaries that killed people. And paramilitaries that killed people. And of course, now you're getting mutterings of course, now you're getting mutterings from the Trump administration saying from the Trump administration saying this is not fair. So you've got Marco this is not fair. So you've got Marco Rubio out saying this is a witch hunt. Rubio out saying this is a witch hunt. This is a great man, you know, this is This is a great man, you know, this is ridiculous Latin American justice. And ridiculous Latin American justice. And it it sounds a little bit like the it it sounds a little bit like the Bolsinari Brazil story again. So are you Bolsinari Brazil story again. So are you saying that the relative peace that the saying that the relative peace that the peace deal led to and which led to Son peace deal led to and which led to Son Santos getting his his Nobel Peace Prize Santos getting his his Nobel Peace Prize that that is not holding? that that is not holding? Well, it's it's very very sad. I mean, Well, it's it's very very sad. I mean, it still has a very high homicide rate. it still has a very high homicide rate. There are still in in particular uh on There are still in in particular uh on the Pacific coast and on the Venezuelan the Pacific coast and on the Venezuelan border whole areas that are out of border whole areas that are out of control of the government where people control of the government where people are being displaced, people are being are being displaced, people are being killed. I think there are something like killed. I think there are something like uh 1,200 municipalities in Colombia and uh 1,200 municipalities in Colombia and armed groups are active now in over 300 armed groups are active now in over 300 of them. So about about a quarter of of them. So about about a quarter of them. It's still much much better than them. It's still much much better than it was in the real holidays when Pablo it was in the real holidays when Pablo Escobar was romping around. It's Escobar was romping around. It's definitely a place where if you're definitely a place where if you're thoughtful is a great place to go on thoughtful is a great place to go on holiday. And I like to pay huge tribute holiday. And I like to pay huge tribute to the clam. It's one of the most to the clam. It's one of the most beautiful fascinating places on earth. beautiful fascinating places on earth. But I'm afraid, yeah, the it's not the But I'm afraid, yeah, the it's not the the holidays before Santos, but it's the holidays before Santos, but it's getting pretty concerning. getting pretty concerning. How much of it is about the drugs trade? How much of it is about the drugs trade? Because Colombia accounts for 67% of the Because Colombia accounts for 67% of the world's total, which is up 25% from the world's total, which is up 25% from the the the year before. And I, you know, I the the year before. And I, you know, I was reading the other day, Roy, cocaine was reading the other day, Roy, cocaine is now the most used stimulant in the is now the most used stimulant in the Americas, ahead of marijuana, ahead of Americas, ahead of marijuana, ahead of amphetamines, and ahead of opioids. amphetamines, and ahead of opioids. American demand is is up twofold. American demand is is up twofold. There's a doubling in demand in I think There's a doubling in demand in I think that just the last few years in the US that just the last few years in the US in the US. Yeah. US. Yeah. in the US. Yeah. US. Yeah. And so it's it's basically this is a And so it's it's basically this is a story about Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. story about Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the way in which the Colombian And the way in which the Colombian cartels took control of the distribution cartels took control of the distribution of cocaine of cocaine of cocaine presumably loss of deforestation presumably loss of deforestation definitely although some of this has definitely although some of this has grown in Savannah area rather than than grown in Savannah area rather than than forest area and it's all intertwined forest area and it's all intertwined because these groups that began as because these groups that began as ideological leftist guerilla groups and ideological leftist guerilla groups and Gustavo Petro comes from one of these Gustavo Petro comes from one of these groups. Do you remember he he was groups. Do you remember he he was president was part of a an urban president was part of a an urban terrorist group that in the 80s terrorist group that in the 80s uh stormed the Supreme Court and when uh stormed the Supreme Court and when the military drove a tank through the the military drove a tank through the front door ended up with half the front door ended up with half the Supreme Court justices being killed. I Supreme Court justices being killed. I mean that's the group that he comes mean that's the group that he comes from. But these groups became from. But these groups became increasingly intertwined uh with revenue increasingly intertwined uh with revenue in some parts of the country. So on the in some parts of the country. So on the Pacific coast, uh there are areas now I Pacific coast, uh there are areas now I was hearing where all the checkpoints um was hearing where all the checkpoints um are now manned again by the armed are now manned again by the armed guerrillas and the armed gorillas are guerrillas and the armed gorillas are issuing your effective national ID cards issuing your effective national ID cards for you to do stuff. So it's not the bad for you to do stuff. So it's not the bad days, but it's going wrong and people days, but it's going wrong and people are getting increasingly worried. are getting increasingly worried. That's very sad to hear. I I I actually That's very sad to hear. I I I actually looked up my diaries for when I went to looked up my diaries for when I went to Colombia just to sort of jog my memory Colombia just to sort of jog my memory and my overall observation of Santos was and my overall observation of Santos was deeply impressive. Heart definitely in deeply impressive. Heart definitely in the right place. the right place. Let's try to get him. I mean I I've also Let's try to get him. I mean I I've also spent quite a lot of time with Ian Duk spent quite a lot of time with Ian Duk who's the last present. So if we'd want who's the last present. So if we'd want to do a little bit on Colombia, I think to do a little bit on Colombia, I think Ian Duk Santos would be great to talk to Ian Duk Santos would be great to talk to because it does matter. I mean it's a because it does matter. I mean it's a population almost as big as the United population almost as big as the United Kingdom. it it's one of the few Kingdom. it it's one of the few economies in Latin America that grew at economies in Latin America that grew at 5% a year for a long time, didn't go 5% a year for a long time, didn't go through uh recessions that other through uh recessions that other countries went through, didn't go countries went through, didn't go through much dictation, but is still through much dictation, but is still frankly parts of it shockingly poor. I frankly parts of it shockingly poor. I mean the um rural areas I was seeing mean the um rural areas I was seeing things that you know people living in things that you know people living in tin shacks without electricity, without tin shacks without electricity, without water, in a pair of shorts and honestly water, in a pair of shorts and honestly it I could have been in rural Kenya. it I could have been in rural Kenya. Well, Santos has actually got a piece in Well, Santos has actually got a piece in the economist last week because he's the the economist last week because he's the chair. The other thing is he's now he's chair. The other thing is he's now he's the chair of the elders, the group of the chair of the elders, the group of elder states men and women that Nelson elder states men and women that Nelson Mandela set up. His article in the Mandela set up. His article in the economist is about trying to take the economist is about trying to take the lessons of the peace process that he lessons of the peace process that he presided over into Russia Ukraine. And I presided over into Russia Ukraine. And I have to say if you knew nothing about have to say if you knew nothing about Colombia, you'd read it and think, well, Colombia, you'd read it and think, well, this guy has delivered the most this guy has delivered the most extraordinary success ever. But where he extraordinary success ever. But where he he has one really really important point he has one really really important point and this is something actually that the and this is something actually that the Norwegian prime minister also said is Norwegian prime minister also said is that even as war is going on you have to that even as war is going on you have to do everything you can to try to build do everything you can to try to build the framework for the peace that you the framework for the peace that you hope to follow. And he's talking here hope to follow. And he's talking here about Russia and Ukraine as was um Yonas about Russia and Ukraine as was um Yonas Gara. We'll put in the newsletter Gara. We'll put in the newsletter because a very interesting piece and um because a very interesting piece and um and he's absolutely right. He refers to and he's absolutely right. He refers to Northern Ireland and that's very much Northern Ireland and that's very much the lesson from that. I mean, Colombia the lesson from that. I mean, Colombia had this what they call the general had this what they call the general agreement that was signed in 2012 and agreement that was signed in 2012 and that that remained the framework the that that remained the framework the whole way through. Um, and it was about whole way through. Um, and it was about recognizing victim's rights, how you recognizing victim's rights, how you generate deep political participation, generate deep political participation, security guarantees and so forth. So security guarantees and so forth. So there he was offering all sorts of there he was offering all sorts of advice to Russia and Ukraine basically advice to Russia and Ukraine basically to get round a table and try and sort to get round a table and try and sort things out. things out. things out. Great. And I think be lovely. It would Great. And I think be lovely. It would be amazing to have mom actually to have be amazing to have mom actually to have a a Nobel Peace Prize winner in that a a Nobel Peace Prize winner in that way. Um, and a little shout out again to way. Um, and a little shout out again to my friend Michael Reid who's been the my friend Michael Reid who's been the key Latin America correspondent for the key Latin America correspondent for the Economist for many years who just Economist for many years who just extraordinary. I mean, he was in this extraordinary. I mean, he was in this area macarina that I was in. It's very area macarina that I was in. It's very inaccessible. He he was there 10 years inaccessible. He he was there 10 years ago. We went to see this incredible ago. We went to see this incredible place called the Rainbow River, which is place called the Rainbow River, which is unique in the world. It goes basically unique in the world. It goes basically red, green, yellow, blue depending on red, green, yellow, blue depending on the light. And it literally looks like the light. And it literally looks like you're looking at rainbow in the water you're looking at rainbow in the water all the way down. But of course, when he all the way down. But of course, when he was there, you couldn't get there was there, you couldn't get there because it was all controlled by the because it was all controlled by the gorillas. gorillas. gorillas. Now, Rory, Jamie Kelly, what do Rory and Now, Rory, Jamie Kelly, what do Rory and Alist think of the farright parties Alist think of the farright parties setting the climate agenda in the EU? setting the climate agenda in the EU? What consequences will this have, What consequences will this have, especially given the particularly especially given the particularly extreme wildfires raging through Europe extreme wildfires raging through Europe this summer? The wildfire thing is very this summer? The wildfire thing is very very very real. NASA has calculated that very very real. NASA has calculated that the number of wildfires has more than the number of wildfires has more than doubled over the past two decades. And doubled over the past two decades. And you've seen these terrifying pictures in you've seen these terrifying pictures in Europe. You've seen these terrifying Europe. You've seen these terrifying pictures of course in California. I was pictures of course in California. I was talking to someone who basically saw the talking to someone who basically saw the entire hillside around their house go up entire hillside around their house go up in flames and their their neighbors in flames and their their neighbors burned to death. 300,000 hectares burned burned to death. 300,000 hectares burned in the EU which is up 78% so almost in the EU which is up 78% so almost doubled on the same period last year doubled on the same period last year number of fires up by 45% compared to number of fires up by 45% compared to 2024 and and I guess the story here is 2024 and and I guess the story here is this big story which is that climate this big story which is that climate like artificial intelligence and like like artificial intelligence and like international security and nuclear international security and nuclear disarmment is something that needs to be disarmment is something that needs to be done internationally globally and of done internationally globally and of course what these farright parties are course what these farright parties are up to is creating ing isolation up to is creating ing isolation challenging international organizations challenging international organizations rules based order. rules based order. Yeah. But there also the the denial. Yeah. But there also the the denial. It's the climate denial, isn't it? It's the climate denial, isn't it? That's part of the problem. The eur and That's part of the problem. The eur and it's not just the European Union. I it's not just the European Union. I think one of the most influential voices think one of the most influential voices in this, I'm afraid, is Donald Trump. in this, I'm afraid, is Donald Trump. You had the environmental protection You had the environmental protection agency in the States recently agency in the States recently downgrading its own commitments to downgrading its own commitments to environmental protection and to the environmental protection and to the responsibility for implementing climate responsibility for implementing climate policy. No, I think this stuff's policy. No, I think this stuff's terrifying and and and you know, I think terrifying and and and you know, I think the other thing I hadn't, you know, I'm the other thing I hadn't, you know, I'm in France at the moment and we had a in France at the moment and we had a forest fire near here a couple of years forest fire near here a couple of years ago and it was it was terrifying. We you ago and it was it was terrifying. We you could see it coming across vegetation could see it coming across vegetation and you know speed that was pretty and you know speed that was pretty alarming and then you see all these alarming and then you see all these planes flying over dropping all this you planes flying over dropping all this you know the fire retardant stuff. I posted know the fire retardant stuff. I posted my tree of the day Roy the other day. I my tree of the day Roy the other day. I found this tree that had survived the found this tree that had survived the fire. This is one tree all on its own fire. This is one tree all on its own surrounded by what was some growing surrounded by what was some growing vegetation. But the other thing I read vegetation. But the other thing I read on my one of my favorite reading on my one of my favorite reading products, the conversation, there was a products, the conversation, there was a very interesting piece about how the the very interesting piece about how the the fires fires fires then produce land that is much more then produce land that is much more liable to flooding. You get these sort liable to flooding. You get these sort of weird trigger chain reactions. So is of weird trigger chain reactions. So is that one disaster you deal with that and that one disaster you deal with that and then you get a different sort of then you get a different sort of disaster. But the big point is that we disaster. But the big point is that we just have to regain the argument on on just have to regain the argument on on just how difficult just how important just how difficult just how important and just how dangerous this is. So if and just how dangerous this is. So if you have people like Trump saying it's a you have people like Trump saying it's a hoax and Farage saying that you know hoax and Farage saying that you know it's all sort of got up by you know the it's all sort of got up by you know the woke lefties then don't be surprised if woke lefties then don't be surprised if we start to see more and more of you you we start to see more and more of you you were at burning. That's what's were at burning. That's what's happening. I mean, and as you say, the happening. I mean, and as you say, the the this is going to create conditions the this is going to create conditions that we've really never experienced. I I that we've really never experienced. I I was just beginning to sort of process was just beginning to sort of process what you're saying. I guess part of the what you're saying. I guess part of the point is that as the vegetation burns, point is that as the vegetation burns, then the stuff that holds the banks then the stuff that holds the banks together begins to erode, the soil be together begins to erode, the soil be it's cuz it's missing the the root it's cuz it's missing the the root substructure to hold it together. substructure to hold it together. Yeah. We we'll we'll we'll put this Yeah. We we'll we'll we'll put this piece in the uh in the newsletter. It piece in the uh in the newsletter. It was very very interesting about how how was very very interesting about how how the the fires of themselves then change the the fires of themselves then change the weather patterns in those in those the weather patterns in those in those areas. areas. areas. The rest is politics let me tell you is The rest is politics let me tell you is as ever efficiently powered by our as ever efficiently powered by our friends at fuse energy. friends at fuse energy. And this week one of the questions we're And this week one of the questions we're discussing is in fact behind Britain's discussing is in fact behind Britain's energy infrastructure is a lot of energy infrastructure is a lot of complexity verging on chaos. You know, complexity verging on chaos. You know, so we talk a lot about the green so we talk a lot about the green revolution, but the nittygritty of how revolution, but the nittygritty of how you actually build things, how the you actually build things, how the transmission distribution works is transmission distribution works is really tough. We've got a question from really tough. We've got a question from Violet Green. So Violet Green asks, "Why Violet Green. So Violet Green asks, "Why is Britain, a global leader in climate is Britain, a global leader in climate ambition, still struggling to connect ambition, still struggling to connect clean energy projects, EV charges, and clean energy projects, EV charges, and even new housing to the grid? And who's even new housing to the grid? And who's to blame for this bottleneck between to blame for this bottleneck between policy and delivery? There we are. policy and delivery? There we are. Question for your friend Ed Milliband. Question for your friend Ed Milliband. Uh, I'll blame the Tories. I do. No. Um, Uh, I'll blame the Tories. I do. No. Um, it is a very good question. The first it is a very good question. The first thing I'd do, Violet, if you haven't thing I'd do, Violet, if you haven't listened to our leading interview with listened to our leading interview with Emma Pinchback from the climate change Emma Pinchback from the climate change committee, I thought she had some very committee, I thought she had some very interesting explainers about the kind of interesting explainers about the kind of big picture on this. But we do seem to big picture on this. But we do seem to have a real problem in the UK at these have a real problem in the UK at these big modernizing infrastructure projects. big modernizing infrastructure projects. Well, you must have had experience of Well, you must have had experience of this kind of thing when you were at the this kind of thing when you were at the Department of Environment. The Department of Environment. The the first thing is that all this new the first thing is that all this new electricbased renewable infrastructure electricbased renewable infrastructure requires a completely different model of requires a completely different model of moving energy and storing energy moving energy and storing energy compared to what used to work when we compared to what used to work when we were operating off coal gas and nuclear were operating off coal gas and nuclear power stations because they could be big power stations because they could be big centralized things. You see them often centralized things. You see them often on coastlines or on hills and you could on coastlines or on hills and you could build a very straightforward electricity build a very straightforward electricity distribution network straight off them. distribution network straight off them. Once you move to wind and solar, you're Once you move to wind and solar, you're suddenly having the electricity suddenly having the electricity generated right across the landscape generated right across the landscape into the ocean in many different places into the ocean in many different places and you're trying to work out how to and you're trying to work out how to move it around and of course how to move it around and of course how to store it. What do you do when the sun's store it. What do you do when the sun's not shining, when the wind's not not shining, when the wind's not blowing? And then you've got this issue blowing? And then you've got this issue around EV. interviewed the Norwegian around EV. interviewed the Norwegian prime minister who said that this year prime minister who said that this year or this month in Norway 95% I think of or this month in Norway 95% I think of vehicles sold are electric but of course vehicles sold are electric but of course for that to work you need the charging for that to work you need the charging infrastructure and and that means infrastructure and and that means everybody's house you know just think everybody's house you know just think about a city think about London how do about a city think about London how do you get fast charging infrastructure to you get fast charging infrastructure to all those cars on all those streets and all those cars on all those streets and that's been a real problem because that's been a real problem because there's planning issues a lot lot of there's planning issues a lot lot of people understandably don't want massive people understandably don't want massive pylons running straight past their pylons running straight past their house. It's an expense issue. Building house. It's an expense issue. Building out that national grid is hugely out that national grid is hugely expensive and and I think Britain just expensive and and I think Britain just that's exactly what we're really bad at. that's exactly what we're really bad at. Partly because of rapidly changing Partly because of rapidly changing ministers, partly because the way of our ministers, partly because the way of our planning laws work, partly lack of planning laws work, partly lack of certainty. So, we're in this weird world certainty. So, we're in this weird world where we've got off coal. We've done where we've got off coal. We've done huge improvements in terms of our net huge improvements in terms of our net emissions. We're leading the world in emissions. We're leading the world in things like offshore wind. But to really things like offshore wind. But to really meet our targets, the thing that I guess meet our targets, the thing that I guess is keeping Ed Milliband up at night and is keeping Ed Milliband up at night and we did touch and spend the interview is we did touch and spend the interview is this whole question of the stuff that this whole question of the stuff that connects it. connects it. connects it. Yeah. Well, the the government is trying Yeah. Well, the the government is trying to fix the planning system, but uh that to fix the planning system, but uh that is not going to be easy. But fuse energy is not going to be easy. But fuse energy is going to help in all sorts of is going to help in all sorts of different ways. The way to think of fuse different ways. The way to think of fuse energy is to think of sort of Amazon energy is to think of sort of Amazon Prime for home energy. Whether you talk Prime for home energy. Whether you talk about solar panels, EV chargers, about solar panels, EV chargers, thermostats, batteries, Starlinks with thermostats, batteries, Starlinks with lots of installers, we're back to the lots of installers, we're back to the theme of paperwork. You have to do the theme of paperwork. You have to do the paperwork, the planning and the grid paperwork, the planning and the grid approval. With Fuse, they handle it to approval. With Fuse, they handle it to the end. They do all the work for you. the end. They do all the work for you. Deal with the planning, grid Deal with the planning, grid notification on customers behalf, so you notification on customers behalf, so you can sit back and relax. So for lightning can sit back and relax. So for lightning fast and affordable home upgrades, go to fast and affordable home upgrades, go to fuseenergy.com/store. Jacob Lang, I recently read about Jacob Lang, I recently read about Palanteer, that's the Peter Teal tech Palanteer, that's the Peter Teal tech company being used by the German police, company being used by the German police, which is making me uneasy. What do you which is making me uneasy. What do you think about this? Now Jacob, I don't think about this? Now Jacob, I don't know if you're in Germany because I know if you're in Germany because I actually heard a podcast on I think it actually heard a podcast on I think it was the Zut Deutsch Sait. They had a big was the Zut Deutsch Sait. They had a big discussion about this. is a huge issue discussion about this. is a huge issue in Germany right now because what in Germany right now because what Palanteer are doing is they're basically Palanteer are doing is they're basically you know the Germany's federal you know the Germany's federal constitutions you have the lender the constitutions you have the lender the regions which have a lot of power regions which have a lot of power including over policing so what you have including over policing so what you have is a federal home secretary interior is a federal home secretary interior minister who is very very wary of minister who is very very wary of Palanteer but Palanteer is going around Palanteer but Palanteer is going around state by state and selling this thing state by state and selling this thing called Gotham which is a sort of data called Gotham which is a sort of data collection system designed to help deal collection system designed to help deal with crime, terrorism, etc. But it is with crime, terrorism, etc. But it is currently, I don't know where Jacob got currently, I don't know where Jacob got that from, but it's currently a massive that from, but it's currently a massive debate inside Germany. debate inside Germany. So, Palanteer does a lot of stuff and So, Palanteer does a lot of stuff and it's been very influential in the it's been very influential in the Ukraine war because it's one of the Ukraine war because it's one of the integrating platforms that allows them integrating platforms that allows them to gather intelligence from cell phones to gather intelligence from cell phones and connect it to drones and connect it and connect it to drones and connect it to other data. I they came across my to other data. I they came across my desk um when I was in prisons because desk um when I was in prisons because they pointed out that all our data on they pointed out that all our data on prisons was divided into I think 150 prisons was divided into I think 150 different databases. So if I asked a different databases. So if I asked a question like you know how many question like you know how many prisoners have a university degree we prisoners have a university degree we simply couldn't answer the question and simply couldn't answer the question and what the Pantier system offered to do is what the Pantier system offered to do is to integrate all this different to integrate all this different information like a kind of octopus information like a kind of octopus reaching out and put it into a data soup reaching out and put it into a data soup to give you these answers. They're also to give you these answers. They're also um working very closely with the NHS. I um working very closely with the NHS. I mean this has been another both a huge mean this has been another both a huge opportunity but also very controversial. opportunity but also very controversial. The opportunity of course is that the The opportunity of course is that the NHS has the best big data in the world NHS has the best big data in the world because since the second world war it's because since the second world war it's been collecting all this information on been collecting all this information on the whole UK population and there's no the whole UK population and there's no equivalent of it anywhere else in the equivalent of it anywhere else in the world. These other insurancebased world. These other insurancebased systems just don't do that. And systems just don't do that. And Palanteer is saying quite rightly that Palanteer is saying quite rightly that if you really were able to read that if you really were able to read that data intelligently using AI, you could data intelligently using AI, you could find incredible discoveries and public find incredible discoveries and public health and improvements and correlations health and improvements and correlations between things you correlated I don't between things you correlated I don't know you know for example maybe you'd know you know for example maybe you'd find a correlation between people with find a correlation between people with blindness and people with some other blindness and people with some other medical condition which you never would medical condition which you never would have expected. have expected. have expected. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Until you'd looked at the data. Um but Until you'd looked at the data. Um but on the other hand the fears about Peter on the other hand the fears about Peter Teal fears about data privacy who's Teal fears about data privacy who's going to get this data under the Tories going to get this data under the Tories basically stopped all of that happening basically stopped all of that happening and I think West Streeting has started and I think West Streeting has started it again and where do you sit on this it again and where do you sit on this question of cuz you can see the question of cuz you can see the benefits. benefits. benefits. Yeah. Well if you remember when we first Yeah. Well if you remember when we first discussed Palanteer probably a couple of discussed Palanteer probably a couple of years ago now and we were very much I years ago now and we were very much I think both of us in the sort of oh god think both of us in the sort of oh god Peter Teal this sounds all very very Peter Teal this sounds all very very libertarian technofascist sort of stuff. libertarian technofascist sort of stuff. not don't like that. So I got a call not don't like that. So I got a call from the chief palanteer people in from the chief palanteer people in London and got taken in for a a London and got taken in for a a briefing. I was very impressed by some briefing. I was very impressed by some of the stuff that they were doing but I of the stuff that they were doing but I remained deeply alarmed and I do find remained deeply alarmed and I do find Peter Teal a very difficult figure to Peter Teal a very difficult figure to handle. We talked a lot about him when handle. We talked a lot about him when we did the series on JD Vance. He's we did the series on JD Vance. He's somebody who doesn't really believe in somebody who doesn't really believe in democracy. Thinks that these tech bros democracy. Thinks that these tech bros are and should remain masters of the are and should remain masters of the universe because they're they're universe because they're they're cleverer. They're richer. they should cleverer. They're richer. they should have even more power than they do. So I have even more power than they do. So I am genuinely concerned and that's the am genuinely concerned and that's the debate that's happening in Germany and debate that's happening in Germany and of course it is in a sense it is quite a of course it is in a sense it is quite a philosophical battle between freedom and philosophical battle between freedom and security I guess because you were saying security I guess because you were saying there that you know you bring all these there that you know you bring all these different data systems together within different data systems together within the prison system I can see how that the prison system I can see how that could help what they're doing with the could help what they're doing with the police system in Germany essentially police system in Germany essentially let's say there's a something happens let's say there's a something happens and they think well this particular and they think well this particular crime has been committed you know find crime has been committed you know find me the 50 people in this area most me the 50 people in this area most likely to have the profile that might likely to have the profile that might lend them towards that. Okay? And lend them towards that. Okay? And straight away you will get names, ages, straight away you will get names, ages, address, criminal record, you'll get address, criminal record, you'll get stuff from their phone, you'll get all stuff from their phone, you'll get all the stuff from their social media the stuff from their social media channels, you know, past and present. channels, you know, past and present. And then equally that may help prevent And then equally that may help prevent crime. It may help solve crime. But what crime. It may help solve crime. But what the privacy campaigners are saying is the privacy campaigners are saying is that it is almost inevitable that that it is almost inevitable that innocent people get caught up in in innocent people get caught up in in that. So that's the debate that's going that. So that's the debate that's going on so far. Bavaria, Hessa and Nordrin, on so far. Bavaria, Hessa and Nordrin, Westfailia have bought it. Bonutenberg, Westfailia have bought it. Bonutenberg, which is one of the big ones, they are which is one of the big ones, they are buying it or they're about to buy it. So buying it or they're about to buy it. So that's from Teal's perspective, and that's from Teal's perspective, and Balanter's perspective is four out of Balanter's perspective is four out of 16. And of course, if they then start to 16. And of course, if they then start to start to show progress on tackling crime start to show progress on tackling crime and antisocial behavior and all the and antisocial behavior and all the other stuff that people care about, then other stuff that people care about, then the others feel they get picked off. the others feel they get picked off. There there's another sort of small There there's another sort of small point on on that. The the software is point on on that. The the software is called Gotham. And of course, Gotham is called Gotham. And of course, Gotham is is to to relate to my interest in these is to to relate to my interest in these guys relationship with superheroes. So guys relationship with superheroes. So Gotham of course is is the world of the Gotham of course is is the world of the Batman. Batman. Batman. Yeah, exactly. So it's And of course Yeah, exactly. So it's And of course Batman is a sort of vigilante super cop. Batman is a sort of vigilante super cop. And so they've deliberately named it And so they've deliberately named it after that. And just as Palanteer after that. And just as Palanteer itself, of course, is is a a name from itself, of course, is is a a name from The Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and a lot of these new companies And and a lot of these new companies come from from either their names are come from from either their names are being taken either from fantasy or from being taken either from fantasy or from superhero fiction. And of course, superhero fiction. And of course, neither of those forms of fiction are neither of those forms of fiction are particularly naturally liberal particularly naturally liberal democratic. Okay. Now, here's here's a democratic. Okay. Now, here's here's a question for you. Probably the final question for you. Probably the final question, but I thought it was one that question, but I thought it was one that maybe would really ring a bell with you maybe would really ring a bell with you and I thought was very interesting. So and I thought was very interesting. So Peter Lo as a mental health campaigner Peter Lo as a mental health campaigner how worried is Alistar about changes to how worried is Alistar about changes to the Samaritans the Samaritans the Samaritans quite worried I'd say quite worried I'd say tell us what's happening what's give us tell us what's happening what's give us a bit of an explanation a bit of an explanation so basically what's happen so the so basically what's happen so the Samaritans everybody will know what the Samaritans everybody will know what the Samaritans is they take last year 3.3 Samaritans is they take last year 3.3 million calls from people who are million calls from people who are feeling lonely, hopeless, desperate, feeling lonely, hopeless, desperate, often suicidal and you phone the often suicidal and you phone the Samaritans and you talk to a stranger. Samaritans and you talk to a stranger. The proposals that are the subject of The proposals that are the subject of the question essentially are these that the question essentially are these that the the plan is to close over a 100 the the plan is to close over a 100 Samaritans branches that's around half Samaritans branches that's around half of the number of branches to move to of the number of branches to move to call center type situations you know call center type situations you know more people in the same space now one of more people in the same space now one of the worries is that's going to mean more the worries is that's going to mean more the larger towns and the cities um and the larger towns and the cities um and then some in some cases for the then some in some cases for the volunteers and of course Samaritans is volunteers and of course Samaritans is the more than 20,000 people volunteer as the more than 20,000 people volunteer as Samaritans that sometimes they would Samaritans that sometimes they would work from from home. Now why the work from from home. Now why the argument that's been put by the chief argument that's been put by the chief executive is that they spend too much executive is that they spend too much money on what she calls bricks and money on what she calls bricks and mortar. The argument against that is mortar. The argument against that is actually that Samaritans is very much a actually that Samaritans is very much a branch organization. The branches run branch organization. The branches run the local operation. They make some they the local operation. They make some they spend some of their resources running it spend some of their resources running it and give resources to the center. and give resources to the center. There's a big debate going on. The There's a big debate going on. The Samaritan's head office has said that Samaritan's head office has said that they're putting out this they want to they're putting out this they want to sort of listen. They want consultation sort of listen. They want consultation which put in the newsletter an article which put in the newsletter an article that was in the Guardian that a that was in the Guardian that a Samaritan volunteer wrote objecting Samaritan volunteer wrote objecting making clear that they that he thought making clear that they that he thought this was a bad idea that it would make this was a bad idea that it would make the service less effective. Another um the service less effective. Another um person I spoke to and look I have no person I spoke to and look I have no evidence of this but it was a very evidence of this but it was a very interesting insight given what we've interesting insight given what we've just been talking about in relation to just been talking about in relation to Palanteer Palanteer Palanteer said that their fear at a deeper level said that their fear at a deeper level was that eventually maybe people will was that eventually maybe people will move to AI being on the end of the phone move to AI being on the end of the phone particularly for the first stage now I particularly for the first stage now I as it happens I was involved in setting as it happens I was involved in setting up an AI mental health service It's up an AI mental health service It's called Jack just ask a question where a called Jack just ask a question where a number of us both people who are number of us both people who are mentally you know service users and mentally you know service users and expert psychiatrists you can go on to expert psychiatrists you can go on to Jack you can ask me a question say about Jack you can ask me a question say about dealing with depression I've recorded dealing with depression I've recorded literally 20 hours worth of answers and literally 20 hours worth of answers and then if you say should I take medication then if you say should I take medication I say that's not for me speak to a I say that's not for me speak to a professional but I can then link them to professional but I can then link them to a professional on the platform so a professional on the platform so there's a part of me thinks that's okay there's a part of me thinks that's okay but I think the thing that's really but I think the thing that's really unique about Samaritan unique about Samaritan is you know and sometimes they're called is you know and sometimes they're called the sort of fourth emergency service and the sort of fourth emergency service and there are other listen there are other there are other listen there are other projects that do the same listening projects that do the same listening project and so forth but there is project and so forth but there is something very very very special about something very very very special about the Samaritans and I think one of the the Samaritans and I think one of the people who are worried about this was people who are worried about this was saying to me is that the Samaritans are saying to me is that the Samaritans are a little bit like the royal family you a little bit like the royal family you can't really criticize them very much can't really criticize them very much but actually there are quite a lot of but actually there are quite a lot of people within the Samaritans I think who people within the Samaritans I think who feel very very anxious about this feel very very anxious about this it's difficult isn't it for brands like it's difficult isn't it for brands like that I mean I think the National Trust that I mean I think the National Trust um went through a an existential fight um went through a an existential fight in terms of its identity. I my my in terms of its identity. I my my instinct is very very strongly that this instinct is very very strongly that this sounds like they're going down the wrong sounds like they're going down the wrong path because I'm sure that providing for path because I'm sure that providing for advice to people works best if you have advice to people works best if you have a local branch network that understands a local branch network that understands local conditions. I'm sure that your local conditions. I'm sure that your volunteers are much more important than volunteers are much more important than you're acknowledging and you're getting you're acknowledging and you're getting their work for free. And I also think their work for free. And I also think they're probably underestimating that they're probably underestimating that they'll lose on the fundraising that they'll lose on the fundraising that these local voluntary branches also are these local voluntary branches also are very very good at doing fundraising, very very good at doing fundraising, raising local support for these things. raising local support for these things. And I think most charities, I don't know And I think most charities, I don't know much about surprises, but most charities much about surprises, but most charities that have gone down this path of that have gone down this path of dismantling all their local branch dismantling all their local branch networks and trying to centralize have networks and trying to centralize have regretted it and often ended up killing regretted it and often ended up killing a lot of the soul and the spirit of the a lot of the soul and the spirit of the organization in the process. organization in the process.
