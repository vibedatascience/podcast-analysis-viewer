Tony Football Show today, deadline day of dreams and dismay. From Isak Noon at Anfield to Emmy Martinez shaken cuz he did not stir. We check on who got lemons and who got lemons in the last minute wheeling and dealing. Then World Cup qualifiers. 13 teams already through. 24 haven't even started trying. We catch up on the ins and outs. And love the Euros this summer. Stand by for Lioness's galore and much much more as the WSL returns. It's the Totally Football Show Thursday the 4th of September and it's a brand new Totally Football Show with you listener. Here's what we got for you today. Some Daniel story. All right, Daniel. >> Good morning, James. >> And here in the studio, Duncan Alexander. >> Hello. >> And Natalie Jedra of Sky Sports. >> Bonia. >> Bonj Natalie Jedra. And Natalie general, what quite the education in English football you've been getting with Sky Sports. Did I not see you the other day in Clethorps? >> Yes, you did. >> Yeah. >> Yes. >> Wow. You were there for a moment of history. Moment of the season so far. >> Yeah. I I had high expectations, but it it really topped that. Yeah. >> It was really interesting how so many people we heard last week cut short their holidays just to be there. Everyone fell bit like, you know, in Close Encounters when everyone's drawn to the strange looking hill. >> There was something about that fixture. Where are you heading next? >> Uh, well, it's International Break. So, yeah, I'm heading home. >> But meantime, were you on duty for deadline day on Monday? >> Um, sort of. Yeah. No, just just following the action as as we all were. >> Yeah, we were >> a lot of action. >> It was hard to follow, wasn't it? So many deals. You know when somebody tidies up for you and then for the next few weeks you keep discovering, oh that's where that went. And I feel like it's going to be like that for this season. We're going to be players are going to be turning up where you least expect them. Zenchenko at Forest for example or Harvey Elliot at Villa. I'm not sure. There'll be more under the radar ones probably. Daniel, >> I mean, Harvey Elliot was the one for me because in a window where it felt like lots of clubs were overpaying through panic, Villa managed to sign him on deadline day and with a on loan and with a agreed fee of Â£35 million for a 22-year-old, which seems a really really good deal for them and in a position they needed. >> I mean, uh, my colleague Tom Harris today has literally, uh, written a piece 10 of the best under the radar >> transfers of this summer window. Yeah, there's lots in there. I mean some of them are very niche. Um I think he's angling to be ahead of recruitment somewhere but I think Adrianne Truffer uh to Bournemouth from Ren you know they've basically kind of >> you know replaced Milos Kirk pretty well and on the opening game he looked better. So I I enjoy when when well-run clubs just identify you know replacements and bring them in and the system takes care of them and that looks to be the case. >> It's so sexy isn't it? I enjoyed Marcus Edwards in terms of deadline day moves going from Sporting to to Burnley. All in all, it's 3.11 billion spent by a billion pounds spent by the Premier League, more than the rest of Europe put together. Among the many remarkable stats, the one that >> popped up on Monday about who was Chelsea's highest paid player, Raheem Sterling, >> and how much he's on, 300,000 a week. >> And how long his contract still got to go? >> Two years. two years. Wow. There might have been panic buying, but nobody signed Raheem. Is that cuz he didn't want to move or should I not be piling in on Raheem like this? Is it a bit unfair to highlight him in quite this fashion? >> I don't think he needs to be a pylon in any sense. The the reports we're told is that he doesn't particularly want to go to Saudi Arabia and play football. And I wouldn't criticize any player for that. Um h it's a shame he hasn't got a move. It's mad that he's only 3031, but he has paid a huge amount of football. He's like a 34 year old in terms of minutes in the legs. So yeah, this is the Chelsea have got quite a lot of credit this summer for managing to sell players for a lot of money and I understand why. But this is the downside of a model that massively overpays players on long contracts is if they don't particularly want to leave, they don't have to. >> Okay. Well, the big moves that did happen on Monday included Isac to Liverpool, A Visa going to Newcastle, Cola Moani pitching up at Spurs, Donna Ruma getting picked up by Man City. There were a couple of players who made headlines by not moving. Uh the most notable perhaps Mark Gay out of Crystal, well, not out of Crystal Palace and Emmy Martinez awkwardly. Which team would you say is materially better post Monday and and does anyone look noticeably worse? Well, better I think I think it's it's it's a good argument between Arsenal and Liverpool because Liverpool they they I I feel like they signed more of the gamechanging uh type of players but Arsenal they they have a really strong squad now and and that's and they addressed the their main issue uh last season which was that squad you know when they had key players getting injured in Odard and Saka they really struggled uh Still they they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and they they were there they finished second in the Premier League but they were always talking about this depth of this lack of of depth in in squad. So for now we haven't seen how much of a game changer can Yokes be or Zubie Meni. So maybe during the season, we can be talking about Arsenal's transfer window in this sense, but with Liverpool and the money they spend and and Ekit already hitting the ground running and and Vitz, there's he hasn't yet, but there's so much expectation around him and and of course with Alexander Isak, which is h god, where do we even start with him, you So currently they have MSA, Floren Bertz, Cody Gakpo, Yuga Katik, and Alexander Each. Is that kind of the best array of of goalc scoring weapons in football? >> Uh yeah, maybe. Um I mean they haven't like increased the number of footballers. They were obviously shuffled and we learned this week that >> KZA is not in the Champions League squad which is you know >> a bit of a of a blow for him but he's got his song so he'll be all right but yeah I mean it it's tricky isn't it because um it's you know how do you play a Kit TK and EAC together I mean both of them can play wide so maybe that will be the way they do it but there's obviously a lot of rotation options now so >> yeah I'm very interested in that actually cuz I remember I I covered a lot of Newcastle last season and and I watched a lot of Alexander Isak in in the flesh and the way he moves around the front three is something that I think people don't talk about enough because his reading of the moment that he needs to attack these spaces I remember seeing uh being in uh Newcastle Arsenal the second leg of the Carabal Cup semi-final and and thinking God did did Eddie how put him to play as a winger today because he was just occupying those spaces. So I'm very interested to see how him and and Ekkit can can link up and that can be a more than just the names itself and and the money they spend but the variety that they can offer >> right I mean even after sort of 15 years of inverted wingers people are still like oh this player scores lots of goals he has to play centrally but you know we know that's not the case >> when you look at Liverpool's squad Daniel possibly that's not what you you would have spent 120 or whatever it is million pounds on given how strong they already looked But is this as much a signing for next season as this? >> I mean, I think the whole summer has been future proofing. Basically, they were by far the best team in the Premier League last season. Uh, and the squad has got stronger. Um, I think there will be some regret that they didn't get Mark Gay signing over the line. Uh, particularly if Canate's form in the first two games continues to wobble. But yeah, the the the front three is going to be extraordinary. I think one of the interesting things is if Ekitiki and Eac both like coming out wide left, I wonder if it might allow Mo Salah to kind of drift more centrally and get into the penalty box and then have Fri Pong overlapping on that right. Salah seems to have been really wide outright in those first few league games and he's not really done. I know he got the kind of clinching goal against Bournemouth, but that was in kind of dirt time and he's not been brilliant other than that. So, I wonder if he might like to get into the penalty box more. I think verts will be accommodated because he'll find space behind them and the more options Liverpool have in the front three ideally the more space it creates for Verts behind and yeah that's kind of worrying for everyone else I think. >> What about Newcastle? Where does this leave them? They went out and spent a lot of that money on Yuan Whissa on transfer day deadline day to join their other recently signed striker Nick Volultard. Was was that the best use of the money? >> I mean it was some use of the money. I mean, they had a lot of money to to spend and not much time to spend it. And we've all we've all gone to into supermarket when it closes in 10 minutes and slightly panicked. I don't think this is that bad. I think they're both good players. I think they are they've paid too much for them. I mean, happy birthday to Vissa for yesterday. Turned 29. Quite a lot of money for a 29year-old, but um yeah, they had they had to reinforce. Um obviously lost Callum Wilson as well. >> So, uh yeah, we'll see. Yeah, I think Newcastle have got the benefit that they've managed fairly well already without a striker this season. So, they they can bed these players in, particularly once Anthony Gordon has served his suspension. But, um, yeah, I think it's it's quite exciting. Um, but yeah, they've got a big season with obviously eight group games or league games, then Champions League to to manage as well. >> And talk about attacking players that can link up. They they can play together, both Visa and and Volt. And I'm I'm kind of looking forward to this because when Visa joins Brenford, he he starts as this very versatile player up front. He can he can play in the in the front three. He can play as a winger and he established himself as as the striker because, you know, he was scoring a lot of goals. Back to to uh Duncan's point, but Volt Voltimad, he is seen kind of as a nine and a half. He's not really a classic nine and he's >> he's not the the number 10, but you know, he can occupy those spaces in between. So, yeah, it can it's going to be interesting. >> He's got he's got good feet for a giant man. >> Yeah. And that's always nice to see. Could they be even better? Do you think Newcastle? >> Better without his. >> Are we pushing our luck? >> I don't know. >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's the transfer saga involving that club was a pretty lengthy and and disputing one, but it's pretty interesting the way I mean possibly not for Newcastle fans, but for everyone else. It's pretty intriguing the way it's turned out. >> Yeah. >> I mean just on Visser actually he he didn't take any penalties last season. So his 19 goals were all from non- penalties and from 19 pretty much xG which is a neatness that I respect. >> Right. >> So he is good >> and like his former colleague Brema of course. >> Yeah. Uh you mentioned Arsenal and Natalie who picked up on Monday. Pier and Capier to beef up their defensive options across town at Spurs. Quite the transfer window. It turned out to be one or two hiccups along the way but not a bad tally after Kudos and Palinia and Javi Simmons and and now Rand Colani. How much does this move the needle for Tottenham do you think Daniel? >> It was my most surprising uh move of the window I think uh certainly of deadline day. It felt like a a moment of opportunity uh and perhaps a need to stress to supporters who were getting pretty itchy about the lack of transfer activity that that Daniel Levy and the club are prepared to invest in players. I suppose it's pretty low risk, but it's it's unless you happen to be Mati tell uh and there are kind of reports that Dominic Sanki is carrying an injury so maybe they felt they needed to do it but Richardson started the season really well. Uh they do have Sileni who cost60 million pounds. They spent30 million pounds on Matastell in this window. It's a huge number of forwards for a team that pretty much just play one central striker. So yeah, it'll be really interesting. I I suspect Milani will be more of a success in the Champions League than the Premier League. I think they'll probably try and bet him in over time in the Premier League. Um and yeah, it wouldn't have been the position I signed a player of our Spurs on deadline day, but when opportunity comes, take it. Colani who had a brilliant start at Juventus scoring pretty much a goal a game when he first arrived in Chirin on loan from PSG but things tailed off a bit wasn't a great U Juve side to be playing in >> at PSG he was known for being a bit wasteful with his chances um but but yeah no if you look at at at the numbers it it just it it it can you know it it doesn't necessarily add up to have uh that many forward players but you you And you can have Rich Charison playing wide. He's he's played wide for a very long time. There are it's it's it's good to have alternatives when you're playing the Champions League and when you need to to make a leap from from the way you were performing last season to the way you need to perform this current season. And and to be fair to Spurs, it could have been a quite a depressing transfer window with the whole A thing. and they seem to turn things around with Shabi Simmons and and with like Kudos and Palinga hitting the ground running. So, so yeah, in the end it was a positive uh window for them. >> I think Spurs as well, like a lot of clubs, you know, were ravaged by injuries last season. And I think compared to last year, I think a lot of clubs have remembered that players get injured and have have bolstered their squad. Um so at this time of the year, it does feel like, oh, how are they going to fit all these players in? But give it a month or two and you know, barebones.org and everyone will get a run out. >> Aston Villa, their deadline day beefing up involved Harvey Elliot who you mentioned Daniel and also Jadden Sancho joining. Uh they are taking Sancho on loan paying 80% of his 12 million pound annual salary. That's quite a lot for a player who's not really lit things up in England. Do you do you see the wisdom in it? >> Not really. No. Um we are told that or were told all summer that one of the limitations on Villa's transfer business was their um necessity to abide by UEFA's more stringent squad cost rules because they failed those rules in the previous time they played in Europe and therefore you have to trim things. Um that was seen to be the limitation on a number of deals that I thought were better or made more sense than the Sanche deal. I don't know if it's a case of of panicking. Um, Daniel Maron was really good in preseason and hasn't really got much of a chance yet. I just Yeah, I don't really get it. I I I think Sancho has struggled for so long in England now. There's clearly a spark of a player still there, no doubt. But he struggled for so long in England now and the wages are so high that I just Yeah, I just don't really think it makes that much sense. Uh Harvey Elliot I think makes loads of sense and I'm you know I'm really glad they got that deal done because I he needs to play football but Sant just found like a bit bit of a stab in the dark like I'd have taken if they were paying 30% of his wages but not 80% cuz those are some big old wages. >> Is this cuz they had so much success with Marcus Rashford in a similar deal last season >> maybe. But then, you know, just to state the bleeding obvious like they're different players with different skill sets and to my mind different personalities. I don't want to kind of pile on Jadden Sancho, but he had quite a lot of chances to sort things out and to get regular football. I I'm not sure this is a move where he still starts every week. I still think he'd be more of a bench player unless he completely revitalizes things and we suddenly get Bundesliga Jadden Sancho, but that's a long long time ago now. And yeah, I just don't see it. I mean, the only counter argument I guess is that Uno Murray is very good at kind of adapting to the players he's got, which maybe some of the managers um Sanchez had since he came back to England haven't been, but 10 assists. It's four years since he moved to Manchester United and across his spells at United and and Chelsea last season, 10 assists in total, which for, as you say, 12 million a year doesn't feel doesn't scream value. Talk a little bit about goalkeepers. goalkeepers on the move, goalkeepers not on the move. Like Emmy Martinez, that's going to be a bit of a bit awkward after he essentially took himself out of the um out of out of Onai's options. >> Yeah, it's always a bit weird, isn't it? And and but I think it's one of those of oh the player uh has his focus on on something else, so you know, we better use other options. So yeah, with him it was kind of like that. But I was sure that someone was going for for Emmy Emmy Martinez and I was >> I was surprised given given the farewell and everything. I was I was surprised he said well good for Villa because you know but but I yeah >> let's see possibly good for Man United the man they taken instead. Seni Lmans is very highly rated when life gives you lemons as United announced on social media bringing him in from Royal Antwark where he ranked among Europe's best shots stopping goalkeepers last season. I haven't seen the list but I'm figuring that Gigi Donarum was probably on that list as well given that shots stopping is his thing. Loves that loves a bit of that and he's now going to be the Etihad. >> Yes, I think this is the one I'm most excited about. >> Most excited about yes it is. Is it going to work, Natalie? >> I thought you might be a bit down on this because it's involved Ederson packing his bags and heading to Turkey. >> No, but we've been hearing about Ederson leaving Man City for like three windows or something. It was It's not like it was a massive shock, but and he did his thing. He changed the the position. He left his mark in the Premier League. So, all the best to Ederson. >> One of the most influential players in Premier League history, right? I would argue >> of the keepers that he has an influence with Gigi Donaruma ranked really really highly. >> Well, influence maybe not not not the term to to use it to to use here. U I'm intrigued because okay, you sign uh a worldass keeper. You you sign like the the competitiveness. So, he brings that to the team. He's arguably the the best keeper in the world. uh but with the the playing with his feet, you know, he he spoke about it in the press conference uh yesterday with with the Italian national team and he said, "No, I can improve on that." And it's not like he doesn't know how to do it. But the fact is, you are signing a keeper that can win matches, so that's never a bad signing. But I'm just intrigued with the domino effect here. Is City going to drop their lines a little bit? Because Ederson sometimes he was playing on the edge of the box and then he was pushing all all the lines forward. So, how much will that have a knock on effect? And and but but at the same time, Pep like we're talking about a manager who uh chose four center and a halfs to to form his backline and who uh took the best out of the number nine that is like the ninest of nines in in Erling Holland. Like he can make um moves that can sound very conservative. He can make it look very fashionable. So in theory it can sound conservative if you have a keeper that doesn't like one of his strengths is not playing with his feet, but he can make it look fashionable and you know just reinventing something. So this is why I'm intrigued. >> Wow, that is intriguing. >> Pep's like a band that you know have a genre and then they come back with a in a different sound. Oh no, actually that makes sense. Yeah. I mean Penny for Joe Hart's thoughts cuz obviously Pep came into City and was like you can't use your feet. you're very good at shots stopping. This is a different time. And now, I mean, we understand that it was Guardiola that pushed for the Donnaruma transfer. Um, obviously James Trafford came in and has done okay in the first three games, but I think he was expecting to be the the sort of new number one or at least establish himself this season as that. Um, I mean, I guess you can argue that >> City the way they play now, particularly, you know, this season with the high line, they are conceding more shots. If you concede him more shots, then who better than Don Rummer to to keep him out. So yeah, I mean we are seeing a more transitional Premier League. Um Peps. Yeah, he's leaning into it. I like it. Well, that does sound intriguing. Daniel, what to say about Paul Mark Gay, meanwhile, who didn't get to make the move from Crystal Palace to Liverpool despite completing much of his medical and apparently even filming his goodbye to Palace. Yeah, there is there is some sympathy I think uh in contrast with uh the way that Yan Whistler and Alexander Each both behaved this summer. Mark Gay was very determined that he would you know he would continue training. He would uh play for Palace in their conference league qualifying playoff. That sounds a little bit like damning with faint praise like well done. You turned up to work but other people weren't turning up to work at the same time. Uh and he hasn't got his move. Um, I don't think he can be that surprised because Oliver Glazner effectively intimated all summer that if Mark Gay leaves without a decent replacement coming in, I will walk. And it sounds like that's pretty much what happened in the final hours of the window. And Palace didn't get an effective replacement in. So therefore, Mark Gay doesn't leave. The the sympathy comes, I think, in the fact that his head was sort of out the door. He was at Liverpool. He'd done the medical. He expected the move to go through, but next summer he or he either gets a move in January and gets paid very well or next time he leaves as a free transfer. And because he's a free transfer, his earning potential will go up. He's also of an age where there isn't that many options in Europe now for central defenders because clubs, elite clubs generally buy them a lot younger and develop them or they buy experience. And Ghee sits in that sweet spot in the middle. So he'll learn pretty assuming he has a decent season. He'll learn pretty much what he wants next summer. >> Well, 155 transfers done all in all and loads on Monday. Just to finish off a couple of other ones I hadn't spotted. Merlin Ro joining Everton, their ninth signing of the summer. Brian Brobby of Ajax in to Sunderland who've also been uh significant movers on the transfer window and one that clever people in the know have flagged up. Florentino Luis out of Benfica to Burnley. He was Natalie statistically the best defensive midfielder in the Portuguese top flight last season and he's now going to be doing his thing at turf more. >> Look at that >> quite major flex from the lower reaches of the of the Premier League. >> But did you guys have an existent a bit of an existential crisis with the the figures with the numbers? uh because I was just thinking where is this gonna stop? H how how damning can this be in the medium to long term to to football? I think other European leagues might not uh mind that as much as they could because if you look at Champions League and and you know we had a final without an English team just three semi-finalists from three different um four semi-finalists from four different leagues uh but you know and I know there are very uh specific circumstances with the expanded format of Champions League and more money and you have an extra window because of the club world cup and You have the new broadcasting deal uh for for the next four years. >> Six English sides in the Premier League as well. In the Champions League as well. >> Six uh Yes, exactly. So, but it just it it I don't know. It just leaves me a bit uncomfortable >> because of the the dominance of the Premier League >> because of Yeah. because of what it can mean in terms of competitive balance. We haven't seen it yet, but maybe it's something that we will see in in the in the next uh few years. Although one thing that struck I think a lot of people is the fact that everybody up and down the Premier League seemed to pick up some something of real value in this transfer window. >> Yeah. I mean we mentioned Sunderland. They I think it's the most the promoted team's ever spent in the history of the Premier League. They are the 10th biggest spenders um in Europe this summer. They're just ahead of Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. So a few years ago they were in League One. Um, so we are the Premier League continues to sort of pull away from the rest of of Europe and I think a lot of European uh media this week has have printed that graph showing just how much the Premier League has spent compared to everywhere else and it is a concern but I think to your point that it is spread out quite well. So the the one good thing the Premier League does is spread the money out. So, um, yeah, uh, we'll see. We'll see what happens. But I am pretty confident that that the three promoter teams are going to, that's my hot take for the season is that they're all going to stay up. >> That's going to be interesting, Daniel. >> Yeah, I mean, it's like Natalie's absolutely right. It is gross, right, in terms of the the actual amount of money spent. I do think it was a slightly >> Yeah, good. I do think it was a slightly um exceptional summer in that Manchester City sort of enforced abdication as uber dominant means that Liverpool and Arsenal spend to rush in. The overperformance of clubs last season meant that they got raided by clubs above them but also then had loads of money to replace those players. I think the determination of the promoted clubs not just to fall with a wimper means that they were always going to spend more. So there's there was pretty much a case for almost every team in the Premier League to spend quite heavily this summer. But yeah, it's gross. I mean the the Premier League spent a billion pounds on Bundesliga players. Like that's not that's not big five leagues anymore. That's big one and four more to use a carman term, >> but that helps them keep their season ticket prices low. >> And that's the real quiz. >> It's like the inverse of the railways. No. M m uh Natalie >> and also I think uh clubs are really learning how to deal with PSR and at first there was this panic of okay nobody moves no one buys no one sells just let's just try to understand that and now they are just >> maybe too comfortable with PSR you know and >> there's only so many women sites you can sell though >> is there >> we simply don't know >> right right but it's so true so maybe they they will need to uh with the coming of of of next seasons uh the following seasons they they will have to go over PSR rules and just you know I I find it a bit absurd that it is actually good for you to sell homegrown players you know it should be the other way around you should and you should encourage clubs to to keep their homegrown players so >> so yeah like things like that might change with uh the or or not I don't know maybe yeah KM just being off. >> Yeah, I mean it's a shame we didn't have this summer the day we had last year where there was a mysterious triangular transfers between Everton, Newcastle, and not Forest. Um that was that was nice, but like Natalie says, I think clubs are more comfortable with the regulations now, but >> yeah, they're always changing a little bit and I think there are there are a few clubs who probably would have hoped to sell more players and maybe have some issues down the line. I mean, City obviously got rid of quite a few on the on deadline day which helped high earners. >> Forest potentially who got a huge number of players for a manager who does not enjoy an expanded squad. E Daniel. >> Yeah, I mean there's there's been I mean Forest is a a bizarre case at the moment because we record the morning after they confirmed that their record club signing Amari Hutchinson 37 a half million won't be in their Europa League squad and neither will Alexander Zenchenko. I mean, I don't know if it's um coincidental that Amari Hutchson is a a Kia Draptin client and so is Eddie who's a sporting director and maybe wasn't Nuno's guy. They spent 35 million on backer on deadline day. Who's exactly Hutcherson's position? So, there's something funny going on there. But yes, I agree in general clubs need to be a lot better at being prepared to sell. And I think supporters probably need to get their head around selling being a sign of strength if you then want to be able to reinvest. That has to be the message moving forward. There are clubs who are very good at it because they already have established relationship should we say with other sister clubs and that's going to become the norm as well I think. World Cup qualifying everybody 13 teams already booked their place three of them cuz they're actually the hosts at the World Cup 2026. There are 35 places still up for grabs. And while some the likes of France and Germany are only just getting their qualifying started this weekend, elsewhere Natalie, it's already the final weekend. >> Boop boop. >> So this is Comibol. >> Yes. >> South American qualifying 10 teams. >> You have to really work not to make it out of these 10 teams. Chile managed. Yeah, Chile managed it. Chile who will be visiting Brazil on this evening as we record Thursday. Thursday night. Chile already out. So, is Carlo using this as a bit of an opportunity to experiment? I notice he's made some bold calls. >> Four forwards. >> This is what what we want. This is Brazilian football. Yes, he he's he's starting four forwards again. >> Which four forwards? >> Uh probably probably no because he he confirmed. So definitely Hafinga Jean Pedro and Gabriel Martinez. >> Okay, those names going slowly. We had ha >> estedro and Gabriel >> Martine esto sorry >> estoed >> yeah Jean Pedro will play as a nine uh because he can play as a 10 and he's been playing as a 10 at at Brighton and recently at Chelsea as well and Martinelli um >> really >> yes so no no Neymar in the squad again uh Angelotti was obviously questioned about it a lot and and he said that initially he said that it was more of a physical matter and then Ayar in during the weekend said no physically I'm I'm I'm fine. I'm not I'm not injured. I'm not not nothing like that. But the the truth is he he looks slow. He doesn't have the same pace. He's been having so many uh injury problems for so long. The last time he played for Brazil was October 2023. So because he had his ACL and and muscular injuries as well. So there's always the question mark around it and and Nelotti was asked about it again and he said yes it is uh phys a physical aspect because we consider the physical aspect very important but it is a lot of other things. The truth is he's playing at Santos and he's not impressing and Santos is you know fighting against relegation in the Brazilian National League and Neymar can't seem to >> push them outside of of of this battle. So, it's always a question mark around Neymar, but it's not like he he won't be at the World Cup, but he uh >> it's not like he won't be at the World Cup. >> I think there are very slim chances of him not being at the World Cup because technically, and Anchelotti said it himself, he you can't question Neymar, you know. >> So, there's a slim chance that he will be at the World Cup. >> There's slim chance he won't be. >> Oh, so he probably will be at the World Cup. >> Yes, he probably will be at the World Cup. But I think but I think he and he doesn't need to be tested according to to Anchelotti, but he needs to step up his game because it it hasn't been good for him. >> And in that magic quartet, I can't remember what the phrase was from 2006 when >> Quadra Magic Mag. Yeah. >> Oh gosh, that brings memory. >> Vinnie, I didn't hear the names of Vinnie Jr. or Rodrigo. >> Yes. So Vinnie is suspended. This is why he's he's not in the squad. Hodrigo has been also struggling with some physical issues, but he's expected to be in the squad, especially because Anchelotti really likes him, worked with him at at Real Madrid. He's been experimenting and observing a lot of players. He said that there are around 70 players that they've been watching and that can be in the in the final squad for the World Cup. So, so yeah, especially in the in the fullbacks positions, we've had um we've had since 2023, we've had 19 fullbacks tested already. >> Yeah, that's quite a churn. >> Yeah. So, the the times of Kafu and Roberto Carlos are are are behind us. And in the last World Cup, it was Denilo and Alexandro. Denilo is playing more of a a center back role now. and Alexandro, he was actually in in the list, but he got uh he got injured. So, it is it's it's been a a problem for Brazil for for quite some time. >> Okay. Wesley of Roma. >> Yeah. >> Is likely to feature. How much credit does Angelotti have in the bank? >> Oh, loads. Loads. >> Yes. Yes. Yes. No way. He can do whatever he wants. We're we're we're putting everything on him. Uh but yes because especially he he brought some sense of positivity around the national team that we haven't had since Qatar and and also the next two games that we have in this uh international break is Chile uh who we've gone through and Bolivia >> who can be tricky with the altitude because it's going to be in La Pas and it's 4,000 m altitude so there are a lot of teams who struggle there but we are expected to not only win but win and play well >> in Brazil. >> Yeah. Well, that does that hasn't been working for the past 24 years. >> So, that's that's not always the case. Uh but but yeah, that's the expectation. Brazil winning in >> What's the what's the recent record for Brazil and La Pass? >> That's a good They do. I believe Bolivia do win a lot there, don't they? Just because they're able to run around where everyone else is playing on the ground. >> Oh, I've I've I've covered matches in in Yes. Yes. Yes. How difficult was it? >> Oh my god. I I I forgot for 5 seconds that I was in Laas and I sprinted down the hall to get a a team sheet. I was hyperventilating for like 10 minutes. >> Nat's a marathon runner. >> Yeah. No. And and it's really funny because when you land the teams, they usually get to La Pass uh just a few hours before the game, which is very bizarre. And I remember I was flying with the national team, so I was in the same flight. And when you get to to La Pas, there's a big outdoor I don't know if it's still there that says you're 4,000 m closer to the sky. >> Nice. >> So, yeah, it's it's kind of their their their marketing is their brand. >> Okay. So, and then they arrive on the day on the basis that there's less time for the altitude to mess them up. >> Yes. After a lot of studies, they they came into the conclusion that you either have a long period of adaptation like two weeks of adaptation or you just go a few hours before you play and you leave. It's a less of a struggle. >> It's very similar um at West Brom in England, which is the highest highest ground above sea level in in England. And yeah, >> teams arrive as quick as they can, which I presume is is the altitude. >> Just a word on Argentina. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yes. No, because it might be Messi's last official game in Buenocidis for the national team being the last round of the the qualifying and you know after Argentina will pray play friendlies and they will travel around. So that's been treated as a big thing in in Argentina. So Messi's whole family is going to be there and you know mother-in-law, father-in-law, uh all the kids, everything. It's just it's just a big thing. They're treating it as a special day. He himself said that it's going to be a special day for him. So >> potentially last home game Claxton for Messi. Very good >> against Venezuela. >> Yes. Match day one at last for some UEFA qualifying groups. Groups A to F on your war charts listeners. Those are the the collections of sides that didn't get started over the summer because there were teams involved in Nations League finals. There's a bunch of teams who haven't played yet. Scotland who will be away at Denmark. Not a great time for Scottish football at club level as Daniel was witness the old firm game. Will it be any better for the national side? The summer friendlies did see them win 4-nil at Likenstein but also lose 3-1 at home to Iceland but Denmark away on Friday night. Spain meanwhile will kick things off against Bulgaria. Germany are in Slovakia. There's Ukraine against France. That's taking place in Rockloff. uh Poland and uh yeah various other teams as well. Among the sides though who are well underway in their qualifying campaigns are England. You may have heard of them. Three wins from three for Tommy Tukul's team. They are top of group K. And who are they taking on on Saturday? It's Andura again which is great because it was so exciting last time. Hey Daniel. >> Yeah one nil away win in Andura. Um I think there is pressure on Thomas Tuchel to release the handbreak a little bit. Um he's got sort of the two perfect games to prove himself and kind of really the first three games were sort of everyone getting to know him. Now it's you really have to go out and try and entertain and score lots and lots of goals against Andor and then you have to go and win in Serbia. Serbia's own draw in Albania means that a draw for the group wouldn't be a bad result for England. it would probably almost guarantee them going through. But yeah, they need to go and beat a decent team away and they're going to try and do it without some key players, which I think is probably a really good thing for England. It allows them to take a look at some players who have been waiting for their chance for a while. >> Elliot Anderson and Jed Spence two, the kind of headline new picks for Thomas Tukor. Yeah, I I it's hard to imagine a player who's gone high, low, high as quickly as Jed Spence, you know, on loan at Forest, one of the architects of their promotion bid, they wouldn't have got promoted without him. To then go to Spurs and be told you were a club signed by Conte immediately. Again, on Wednesday, he spoke and said that that really hurt him. Like, it broke his confidence for a while. Understandably, terrible management on Conte's part. Um and then yeah to slowly build your way back in after three loan spells and end up in the England senior squad for the first time it's yeah some effort and we should say largely playing out position. He was a right back or right wing back at Forest and he's doing it on the left at Spurs. So I suspect Lewis Skellyy probably starts over him um against Andor and if Lewis Skelly plays well probably keeps that against Serbia. But yeah, amazing for for Jed Spence and for Elliot Anderson who given Adam Wharton's injury is probably going to start as a six for England. >> Milan's Ruben Loft Cheek has got record no Trent Alexander Arnold. Anything else that leaps out of you from the squad, Duncan? Um it sort of feels like the squad everyone expected him to pick when he first started in the sense that it's it's a lot of the players who performed really well in the Premier League last season like uh like Elliot Anderson like EZ whereas when he first started he he brought in you know Kyle Walker was still there and and Jordan Henderson and it was a bit like huh what what are you doing? Um, so yeah, as Daniel says, I think England are going to qualify, but they need to sort of show some cohesion and some sort of progress under TUL. Um, and I think, you know, what's par at home to Andor 5-nil. So, I think they probably need to cut loose and go for seven or eight to to allay any fears. >> That sounds like fun. >> It's a busy international weekend with games all over. I'm not sure if there's any other fixtures that have caught your eye. Uh Netherlands who've won their first two matches 100-0 on aggregate. They'll be hosting Poland. Intriguing game Friday evening as Italy take on Estonia in what is Janera Gatuzu's first game in charge. Italy not off to the best of beginnings to their campaign. They've missed the last two World Cups. They're currently third in their group. Only the top team automatically qualifies and they are a full nine points behind the leaders Norway. Although they do have two two games in hand. Franchesco Pio Esposo of IN and Liverpool's new defender Javanni Leoni are the uncapp players in Gatuso's first squad. >> Come on, Italy. >> Isn't uh the 2006 World Cup final was the last time Italy won a knockout game at the World Cup. >> There you go. >> It's been a while. >> Been too long. Duncan, >> does anyone um does anyone miss when World Cup qualifying used to be really tense? Because >> yes, >> remember when it was like, oh, I'm not sure, you know, England or where in the Netherlands and you know, >> I was talking the same with with South American qualifiers, Duncan. The same I was talking about it. >> Well, Brazil had a bit of a wobble, but when was it last tense for Brazil? >> Oh, it was uh to qualify for 2002. It was really tense. I remember 94 was really tense as well. the the coincidentally the the two World Cups that that we won. But now it's six teams uh that that qualify and then then there's the seven that play the playoffs. So, you know, you really need to pull an effort to >> even the fact that they're squashing the UEFA qualifying into three months for most teams, you know, September, October, November. This used to be a drawn out tense process. Now it's a sort of administrative procedure. Well, there'll be some exciting live administrative football box ticking uh this weekend all over. Daniel, before we leave the international fixtures, anything else you wanted to flag up? >> Yeah, I mean you we briefly mentioned Scotland there. Um but because of the domestic stuff, because of the way the national team have really declined quite considerably under Steve Clark, this feels like a pretty enormous weekend for Scotland. They've got Denmark away uh which they really need to take something from and then they've got Bellarus at home which is I think if you're going to write down a sort of fixture that Scotland would end up drawing 1-1 conceding the last minute it would be Bellarusa home. They'd need to be far better than themselves. The the goodwill that they built up prior to Euro 2024 has sort of gone almost completely been extinguished. So yeah, it feels like a big weekend for Scotland. After this summer's hugely enjoyable Euros in Switzerland, WSL returns this weekend. The new campaign starts on Friday with the champions Chelsea taking on Manchester City. Megan Finga joins us now. Hey Megan, how are you doing? >> Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Happy um I was going to say Friday. It's only Thursday. >> Well, might be Friday list or Saturday. Have a happy day, whatever you're doing. Megan, you've just joined us from recording an episode of the Athletic FC podcast. Check it out, listener, if you haven't done yet. In which you've been debating whether or not women's football is actually growing. What was the verdict? >> It's it's growing like like a flower, but it needs a little bit of water. It needs a bit of sunshine. Um, and it needs probably a bit of direction, too, cuz you know, investment's great, but you sort of want to have regulations. You want to make sure that, you know, any and all investment at any cost is not the mantra. So yeah, it's interesting to see if the women's game can maybe take a few lessons from the men's game and and not just invite anyone in. Um but as well, uh clubs want money. So it's this very rickety balance >> from the men's game by in kind of popular folklore. One of the most key things that caused the boom in English football was a a highly successful uh international tournament in the summer. I'm thinking of Italian 90 and and the way that really changed the whole perspective of of football in this this country. There's just been a terrific tournament in the summer which I think brought in viewers particularly with England doing so well in unprecedented numbers. Are you anticipating that to have a kind of knock-on effect on on the WSL season? >> Yeah, I think so. I think it was 11.6 million people tuned into to the England final versus Spain. And I I think if you look back at the last year where England won on home soil, there was this huge influx of fans who are coming to WSL games, attendances rose by I I mean like 50 60 70%. I don't think it's going to be as extreme this time around, but that's because you do have sort of established fan bases now in some semblance at least kind of in the top six six teams in the WSL. I do think this is going to be big. you know, there's a lot of clubs who have kind of built a transfer strategy on getting a Lioness um and a lot of their marketing and um their commercial value is through a lioness. So, you are going to see that. I don't think that there's any surprise that if you go around um South London where Chelsea is, Lucy Bronze is on quite a lot of posters and that is for very obvious, you know, summer Euro 2025 victory reasons. So, I I think it's going to have a massive effect, but I also think clubs probably need a little be a little bit smarter. you know, last season in the WSL, they had um some of their lowest attendances from the year prior. So, how do you make sure that you capitalize on the success without also like being overly reliant on it? Because in 3 years time, you know, you you can't just keep relying on the international cycle to to for the boom and bust of attendances. >> Natalie, you going to be working on this for Sky Sports? >> Uh yes, during the season. Yes. And I I'm interested actually, Megan, to to understand how what Chelsea and Arsenal have been doing to kind of swap positions, you may say, from Chelsea winning the WSL uh yet again and Arsenal winning the Champions League and just, you know, for for them to achieve the the the different goals. >> Yeah, it's I think it's not wrong to say that for Chelsea, winning the Champions League is the end all and be all. And a lot of people say last season they had this perfect season and you know they were unbeaten. They won the domestic trouble and yet they still didn't win the Champions League and and that is the monkey on their back. They have to win the Champions League at some point. And for Arsenal who had a horrible start to the domestic campaign, bring in Rene Sleggers on a permanent deal halfway through the season and then just go and beat Barcelona who beat Chelsea um in in the semi-finals of the Champions League. It was kind of a like, all right, now balls in your gore Chelsea. Let's see what you can do. Um, but for Arsenal, they haven't won a title, God, since 2019, a domestic title, sorry. Um, and that's that's a big, again, like you say, monkey on their back. >> The London City Lionesses with Michelle Kang, are they going to be the kind of the next big WSL expansion project, do you think? >> I think they already are, to be honest. Um, some of the names that they have been able to entice over to the WSL this summers and is absolutely jaw-dropping, incredible. And and today we're sort of recording on a Thursday morning. um transfer deadline ends tonight. Um and they are linked to even more players and and one of those players from reports out in France is Grace Gayoro from PSG and I think that would be the absolute signing of the summer for for London City Lioness's. Um the word that's usually associated with them is disrupting and disruptor. Um depending on who you ask, Michelle Kang is either the most brilliant thing in women's sport or she is the bane of your existence because she is forcing you to do things you didn't want to have to do. So Michelle Kang being the the owner of the club who also owns Lyon and the uh American side Washington Spirit. >> Yeah. So currently in the women's game, the regulations and rules around multi club ownership aren't exactly there. Uh we actually spoke on the Athletic FC podcast to Nikki Det around about this and she had mentioned that it comes down to the fact that it's still a startup women's football. So they don't want to necessarily put too many ropes and hurdles around. So then maybe people don't want to invest. But at the same time, if you look at the men's game, multi club ownership is causing a lot of problems. So, it feels like it'd probably be better to put in regulations earlier than later. Um, I feel like being proactive in the space is much better than being reactive. Um, but at the moment, Michelle Kang is sort of the the woman who is trying to lasso quite a lot of clubs together and and she's doing quite a good job of it. >> So, the last two sides have come in. They're they're newly they're the new side in WSL this season. And the last two uh sides coming into the division both went down again in Crystal Palace and Bristol City. Line City line S's have an interesting start because they're actually away to Arsenal this Saturday lunchtime at the Emirates. What do you think about their prospects of of really making a splash? >> I think I mean in terms of a baptism I mean this is this is incredible for them and I think as well London City Lionesses want to go to Arsenal at the Emirates. I mean, in terms of marketing and commercial value, that's incredible. But I personally, I think for me, they are not going to be a team that goes down this season. I can't see them being like Crystal Palace, who went up and went straight back down. Um, you know, Bristol City up, straight back down. And I don't think they're going to be that way. They've invested smartly. They've got a really, really good manager. Um and I think the investments that they have made it's not just I mean you've got quite a lot of veteran players who know how to play but you've also got quite a lot of young players as well. Tea Goldie Frey Godfrey um both of them are great young Lionesses who have come through. So there is a level of we're being sort of pragmatic about the present. Let's get players who can play but there is they are also looking at the future. Um for me Leicester City are the ones that that really need to get their ducks in a row. Um they just sacked their manager about a week or two ago. Um there are reports going around that they're trying to hide Matt hire Matt Beard, former Liverpool who just signed a uh contract with Burnley who are in the third tier about a month ago. He's now been put on 3 month Gardening leave. Um and they've signed about two players as of now. I think there's trail start to bring in about two or three um before the end of tonight. So I think keep an eye on Lester cuz it doesn't look too pretty at the moment. >> Okay. When does the transfer window end? >> 11:00 p.m. tonight. So I've got 12 hours. >> Oh, criy. Everton have now got Goodison all to themselves and this weekend they got a Mercyside derby. >> Yeah, I mean I I scheduling gods did a great job. Um for those who don't know Brian Senson's record at Anfield, so Brian Senson is the Everton manager. His record at Anfield is phenomenal. He's either one he's never lost at Anfield. Um he's sort of um the bane of Liverpool's existence when it comes to that. Um, and Liverpool had actually failed to score a single goal at Anfield Liverpool women because they kept hosting Everton and Everton wouldn't let them score. So, they finally just stopped letting Everton play at Anfield. They're like, "Right, we need to get someone else in here so we can finally score." Um, but Everton are really exciting this summer, mostly because they've just signed, I think, nine players in total. They broke their club transfer record for Ruby Mace from Leicester yesterday. Um, and there's a lot of excitement around there because for the last couple years, the women's team has sort of existed in a form of survival, but in the last six months since the new ownership have come in, they've they've definitely sort of embraced the women's team as an opportunity. Um, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're one of the clubs that end up getting some outside investment soon. >> All right, Megan, where are you going to be going this weekend? >> So, I'm going down to London today and I will be there for Chelsea and Manchester City tomorrow. I will be at the London City Linuses and Arsenal game the next day and then back to Liverpool and I will be there for the Mercyside derby. >> Wow. Where can we hear about all of that >> on the Athletic? You can go and read all of our fun stuff. Um it won't just be me writing. Um Art Rock will be writing about Arsenal. Um Carish Jones who was an intern and is now full-time with us. She'll be writing about some Chelsea stuff as well. Um I'm sure Charlotte will be around um to write anything and everything about Manchester United. So, loads of content people can get their teeth stuck into this weekend. >> Excellent. And hopefully you'll be joining us as well to keep us updated, too. Megan, thank you so much for joining us today. >> You're welcome. Thanks for having me. >> What do you want to talk about, Natalie, before you got to head off? >> South American, >> but it's not interesting anymore. >> No, don't say that. It was just an emotional, you know, Latins. Yes. >> Are you heading off to interview somebody now? >> No, but interviews to to come in next week. >> Very exciting one. um interviewing Mariska for a tactical friend that uh that we're we're having this this season. So, >> Daniel, you having a quiet weekend? I'm going on holiday on Sunday to So, yes, I'm going to have a great time. I had a question for Natalie about Brazil, though. >> Yes. >> Mario had a an absolute nightmare on his Brazil debut as I understand. maybe in the last international break or the one before is he still considered like the answer at central center half for the next 5 years whatever. >> Yeah, Murilo it's it's an interesting one because he got called up a few times and he made his debut in that awful game against Argentina the the 4-1 that we lost and we want to erase from our memories. Uh but but that game was very representative of everything that was going on wrong with Brazil. And when you link that to Muriel starting that match, it it it is it is a cor a very unfair correlation, but a lot of fans make this this link between both things. Uh so yeah it's it's bad for Murillo because you know uh there are a lot of fans who are misjudging him but I I I wouldn't say that he because Carlo Chelotti he he brings a a fresh vision of things and I'm absolutely positive that he's monitoring Murilu uh that he's not influenced by all the noise. This is the good thing about having a a guy like like him in charge of the national team because there's so much pressure and every time I I speak to Brazilians who play for the national team, they always say the same thing. The amount of pressure that you have to deal when you are there is ridiculous. And when you have a guy like Angelotti leading the team, he can absorb a lot of this pressure. So maybe that will benefit people like uh players like Murilo uh who wasn't in the in this uh in this list. Uh yes, he wasn't on on this list, but I'm I'm expecting him to to feature soon. >> What's the stupidest question that Angelott has been asked so far? In the sense that like when there's a foreign manager in England, they always ask them some nonsense about have you seen this or do you know about this? I mean, surely he's had the equivalent in Brazil. >> Yeah. You know, if you watch Brazilians, uh, Brazil's press conferences, they're they're very lengthy questions. It's it's really interesting. And he's been very good in immersing himself in Brazil and in Brazilian football cuz, you know, he's going to all the grounds. He's calling up more players that play in Brazil, which is always something that the fans really appreciate. But but yeah, I I I can't think of anything, but I can I the only thing that I can think of, Duncan, is like the amount of pictures that they they released with him in touristic places, you know, like just to Yes. Yes. Just to to make this relationship work, you know, between And he's he's giving his press conferences in Portuguese already. >> Nice. Is he living in in Brazil? >> Yes, he's living in Rio. Yeah, >> I mean Portuguese is very much Italian adjacent and Spanish adjacent. So, >> but it's not the same language. >> For me, it is. >> Oh, James, I'm so offended by that. >> Just different hand gestures. >> Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just have to get the hand gestures. >> No, no, I'm joking. It's a completely different uh Yeah, >> it is different. >> It's not so different. >> It is different. And and I think it's very nice that he really tries he he's making a proper effort to give like half an hour press conferences all in Portuguese and sometimes he mixes uh the the languages which is very normal but >> cute. >> Yeah, it's nice. Yeah, we're we're in a honeymoon phase with him. So >> Oh, that's so nice. >> Yes, it is. I don't know if I mentioned but there are >> three teams that can qualify. There are uh three teams already qualified. Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador. and Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia are fighting for a spot >> and they could sort it out this weekend. >> Yes. And they can Yes. And Venezuela basically out of the 10 uh only Chile is is out of the picture. Venezuela can qualify for the first time uh to the World Cup. So yeah. >> All right, Natalie, you got to go and so have you listener probably. So we'll wrap it up there for this totally football show. Many thanks Natalie for coming in.
