**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Philosophy of Freedom and Fearlessness

***"You live and then you die. There's no such thing as your death in your life. You stop experiencing life once you die. So you have to ask yourself: Is it worth living a life full of fear of death? Or is it much more enjoyable to forget about this and live your life in a way that makes you immune to this fear?"***

The foundation of Durov's worldview stems from experiencing the stark contrast between societies with and without freedom at age four, when his family moved from the Soviet Union to northern Italy. Even as a young child, the difference was visceral—the abundance of toys, ice cream varieties, and cartoons represented something deeper than material wealth. It demonstrated that freedom enables not just consumption but contribution to society's richness.

This early experience crystallized into a core principle: **freedom matters more than money**. The practical implementation of this philosophy requires confronting humanity's two greatest enemies of freedom: **fear and greed**. Durov's approach to fear is methodical and rational—by imagining the worst possible outcome and becoming comfortable with it, fear loses its power. This isn't about being reckless; it's about recognizing that we are biological beings hardcoded to fear death, yet we can consciously override this programming through rational thought.

The contemplation of mortality serves a dual purpose. First, it removes the paralysis that fear creates. Second, it makes every moment more precious. By remembering that death exists and could come any day, each day gains significance. This isn't morbid pessimism but rather a framework for living fully. The stoic acceptance of mortality paradoxically enables deeper engagement with life.

**The principle extends beyond personal philosophy into business decisions.** When facing pressure from governments, intelligence agencies, or business interests, the question becomes: what can they really do? The worst case is death, but if one has already made peace with mortality, then threats lose their leverage. This isn't theoretical—Durov has faced actual life-threatening situations and emerged with his principles intact, even strengthened.

## 2. Stoic Lifestyle and Substance Abstinence

***"When you drink alcohol, your brain cells become paralyzed. They become literally zombies. And then next day, some of your brain cells die and never get to normal. If your brain is this most valuable tool you have in your journey to success and happiness, why would you destroy this tool for short-term pleasure?"***

At age 11, Durov's biochemistry teacher gave him a book called "The Illusion of Paradise" that described the biological and chemical processes occurring when consuming addictive substances. This early education proved transformative. The book explained that alcohol literally paralyzes brain cells, turning them into "zombies," and that after consumption, some brain cells die permanently. For someone who values the mind as their most important tool, this was a decisive argument against alcohol consumption.

The philosophy extends to all addictive substances: tobacco, coffee, pills, and illegal drugs. **The core insight is that short-term pleasure isn't worth sacrificing long-term potential.** This isn't about moral superiority but about rational calculation. Every substance that provides temporary relief or pleasure comes with a cost, and that cost is paid by your future self.

**The social pressure to drink is significant**, particularly in business and social settings. Durov's advice for handling this pressure is straightforward: don't be afraid to be contrarian and set your own rules. If someone feels they need alcohol to socialize, there's an underlying problem—usually fear—that needs to be addressed directly. Whether it's fear of approaching someone attractive or fear of social rejection, the solution is to confront and overcome that fear through practice, not to mask it with alcohol.

The deeper issue is that alcohol and other substances serve as spiritual painkillers. They temporarily suppress problems without solving them. The mind is trying to communicate something valuable through discomfort or anxiety, and flooding it with substances prevents that communication. **The debt must eventually be paid, and it comes with interest.** Better to address the root cause directly.

This extends to a broader philosophy about being different. Humans have an ancient, hardwired fear of being excluded from the tribe, which historically meant death. But in modern society, this fear is irrational. If you do exactly what everyone else does, you have no competitive advantage and cannot become outstanding. **Success requires differentiation**, and that means being comfortable standing apart from the crowd, even in social situations.

## 3. Physical Discipline and Mental Clarity

***"The main muscle you can exercise is the muscle of self-discipline. If you get to train that one, everything else just comes by itself."***

Durov's daily routine begins with 300 push-ups and 300 squats every morning, followed by gym sessions five to six times per week lasting one to two hours. While these exercises may not dramatically change body composition, they serve a more important purpose: **practicing self-discipline**. Most mornings, the desire to do push-ups and squats is absent. Squats are particularly boring—not especially difficult, just tedious. But overcoming that initial reluctance builds the mental muscle that makes everything else easier.

The connection between physical activity and mental performance is direct and measurable. **The efficiency of the brain is limited by how much sugar and oxygen the heart can deliver through blood.** Physical activity makes the lungs more efficient, the heart stronger, and the entire cardiovascular system more capable of supporting intense mental work. This isn't just about health or appearance—it's about productivity, stress resilience, and the ability to think clearly under pressure.

**Swimming serves as both physical training and meditation.** Multi-hour swims across large lakes teach patience and mental endurance. The longest swim Durov completed was 5.5 hours in Finland, during which he got lost. These extended physical challenges create a meditative state while building the kind of patience necessary for long-term projects. When starting a journey that will last hours, there's natural reluctance. But after 10 minutes, then 20, then 30, the rhythm takes over. This teaches the incremental approach to achievement—start small, maintain consistency, and the goal eventually arrives.

**Extreme temperature exposure through banya (sauna) and ice baths** represents another form of discipline training. The heat and cold are often unpleasant in the moment, but the feeling passes quickly. The discomfort lasts only minutes, while the benefits—both physiological and psychological—last for hours and days. This is the inverse of alcohol: temporary suffering for long-term gain, rather than temporary pleasure for long-term harm.

The practical impact on work is immediate. When unable to train, stress becomes noticeable within a day. Physical activity isn't a luxury or hobby—it's a fundamental requirement for running a large company, for making good decisions under pressure, for maintaining the mental clarity needed to innovate and lead.

## 4. Dietary Philosophy and Intermittent Fasting

***"Sugar is addictive. The more you consume sugar, the more you want it. The hungrier you get. So if you want to stay efficient and healthy, why consume processed sugar? You'll just end up snacking all the time."***

The dietary approach is built on simplicity and efficiency. **Processed sugar is eliminated** because it creates an addictive cycle—consumption increases craving, which increases consumption. This leads to constant snacking and energy instability. While not militant about sugar (berries and fruit are acceptable when the body needs them), the principle is clear: processed sugar is unnecessary and counterproductive.

**Red meat was eliminated 20 years ago** due to personal experience—it made Durov feel heavy and sluggish. This isn't a universal prescription but rather an example of listening to one's own body and metabolism. The primary diet consists of seafood and vegetables, which provide necessary calories without the heaviness that interferes with mental clarity.

**Intermittent fasting, typically eating only within a six-hour window**, brings structure to eating habits and eliminates the craving for sugar. When you know you won't be able to snack for 18 hours, consuming sugar becomes self-punishment rather than pleasure. This structure also aligns with the body's natural rhythms and has documented longevity benefits.

The philosophy extends to **complete avoidance of pills and pharmaceutical products** since adulthood. The reasoning is straightforward: pharmaceutical companies are not incentivized to eliminate the root cause of problems. They profit from ongoing treatment, not from cures. A headache, for example, has a cause—dehydration, poor air quality, insufficient sleep, stress. Taking a painkiller mutes the symptom without addressing the cause, allowing the harmful factor to continue its damage.

**The analogy to piloting a helicopter is apt**: if warning lights start blinking and alarms sound, you don't smash the warning system with a hammer. You identify and eliminate the threat. Yet with our bodies, we routinely take pills that silence the warning without fixing the problem. This isn't to say pills are never necessary—antibiotics can be essential for certain infections—but they are vastly overused.

## 5. Digital Minimalism and Information Curation

***"I want to define what is important in my life. I don't want other people or companies or organizations telling me what is important today and what I should be thinking about."***

Despite founding one of the world's largest social networks and messaging apps, Durov maintains an unusual relationship with technology. **He doesn't use a phone except occasionally to test Telegram features.** This isn't about being disconnected—it's about maintaining agency over attention and thought. The phone provides distractions and guides what you look at, effectively outsourcing the decision of what's important to algorithms and other people's agendas.

**Mornings are sacred time for thinking.** Even when allocating 11-12 hours for sleep, actual sleep time is less, leaving hours for lying in bed thinking. Many people hate this and reach for sleeping pills, but these moments produce some of the most valuable ideas. The morning routine—shower, exercise—all happens without a phone. Opening the phone first thing in the morning means becoming a creature told what to think about for the rest of the day.

The principle is simple but profound: **take time to think about what's really important for you and what you want to change in the world.** This doesn't mean complete isolation from information sources, but it requires deliberate curation. Don't be a slave to AI-driven algorithmic feeds that ensure everyone consumes the same information, the same memes, the same news. Instead, proactively set goals and actively search for information relevant to those goals.

**The paradox of connectivity**: the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you become. This seems counterintuitive for someone running a major communication platform, but it's precisely because of understanding communication's power that Durov recognizes its danger. Most information bombardment is irrelevant to success. The entire world can be fascinated by a quarrel between powerful figures, but for 99% of people, it's irrelevant—it won't change their lives, and they can't affect it.

**The internet and social media present drama as if it's the most important thing in the world**, as if the tides of history will turn on today's outrage. But most things won't turn those tides. The challenge is identifying what's timeless—what's happening today that will still be true in 10-20 years. This is nearly impossible on social media, where everyone is outraged about the news of the day, then moves to the next outrage tomorrow.

## 6. Competition and Education Philosophy

***"Competition is key. This is what motivates a lot of teenagers when they're at school. If you remove competition out of the education system, you end up forcing kids to start competing elsewhere—for example, in video games."***

Durov's educational experience at an experimental school in St. Petersburg was formative. At age 11, he entered a program that attempted to squeeze maximum information into teenage brains, focusing on mathematics and foreign languages. Students learned four languages simultaneously (Latin, English, French, German, plus optional Ancient Greek) alongside subjects like biochemistry, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology. **The assumption was that nobody could excel in all subjects**—it was considered impossible. The goal was to push the limits of the human mind and see what happened.

This experience revealed that **mathematics is essential** because it shapes the brain. It teaches logical thinking, breaking big problems into smaller parts, sequencing them correctly, and solving them patiently through iteration. These are exactly the skills needed in programming, project management, and entrepreneurship. Mathematics is one of the few subjects that encourages developing your own thinking rather than repeating others' opinions.

**Competition emerged as a crucial motivator.** Durov initially found school boring and experienced an existential crisis common to teenagers. He decided to attempt the impossible: become the best student and get excellent marks in every subject. This was extraordinarily difficult—even studying constantly left insufficient time for all homework and test preparation. He used breaks between classes and ultimately achieved his goal, which kept him engaged and motivated.

**The modern trend of eliminating competition from education is misguided.** Well-meaning authorities and parents want to reduce stress and anxiety by removing public grading systems and rankings. The intention is to eliminate losers, but the result is also eliminating winners. Children lose interest when there's no competition. Worse, they're unprepared for real life, which involves constant competition for jobs, promotions, and customers. The result is high suicide rates and unemployment in countries that thought eliminating competition was beneficial.

**Humans are biologically wired to compete** and establish understanding of their qualities and talents relative to others. This is how society self-regulates. Countries with education systems based on ruthless competition—China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan—are outperforming European countries that have tried to shield students from competitive stress. The choice is stark: support competition with the understanding that it leads to progress, science, technology, and abundance, or remove competition thinking you can shield future generations from stress, only to create a less competitive economy and society.

## 7. Early Programming and Creation of VK

***"I started to build computer games because I didn't have enough of them. Scarcity forced me to start building them just to play myself. Scarcity leads to creativity."***

Durov began coding at age 10, initially creating video games because he didn't have access to many games or even the internet. **This scarcity proved generative.** Many successful programmers from the Soviet Union and similar environments developed their skills precisely because they lacked access to modern technology and entertainment. Without abundant entertainment options, they weren't distracted and had to create their own.

The first projects were simple two-dimensional turn-based strategy games. When performance wasn't optimal, his brother Nikolai would guide him on optimization. This learning-by-doing approach shaped fundamental coding skills. **One notable project was creating a computer opponent for an infinite-field tic-tac-toe variant** (five-in-a-row) that his classmates played during breaks. Durov wanted to win every single time against very smart classmates—sons and daughters of university professors, math olympiad champions. To guarantee victory, he needed practice against a stronger opponent than himself, so he coded an AI that calculated four moves ahead. When that wasn't enough, his brother helped optimize it. Eventually, Durov trained himself to win consistently, but ironically, this killed the game—classmates lost interest when they couldn't win.

**At St. Petersburg State University, Durov found classes too easy**, so he created a website for students of his faculty. He organized digital versions of all exam answers and lecture notes—revolutionary for 25 years ago. The website included discussion forums, friends lists, photo albums, profiles, and blogs. It expanded from one faculty to the entire university, then to other universities, reaching tens of thousands of users as a student portal.

After graduation, a former classmate who had attended an American university showed Durov Facebook and asked if he was trying to build a Russian version. **Durov hadn't even heard of Facebook.** But seeing it clarified which features to eliminate for scaling to millions of users. **Getting rid of features is as important as adding them.** Existing users will always ask for more complexity, but new users need simplicity.

**VK (V Kontakte, meaning "in touch") was started to solve a personal problem**: staying connected with university classmates after graduation and meeting new people. Durov decided to build it from scratch without third-party libraries or modules, obsessing over every line of code for maximum efficiency. When facing the daunting task of starting such a large project, he called his brother and asked where to begin. The advice was perfect: **"Just build a module to authorize users. Just to log in."** Once you can type in credentials and see a personalized greeting, the path forward becomes clear.

**For almost a year, Durov was the sole employee**—backend engineer, frontend engineer, designer, customer support, and marketing. His girlfriend helped compile databases of Russian schools and universities by sourcing information online and contacting education departments. This comprehensive experience of building every aspect of a social network proved invaluable for understanding what a single person can accomplish and for later managing teams efficiently.

## 8. Technical Architecture and Scaling Philosophy

***"If you have too many employees, 90% of their time will be spent coordinating the small pieces of work they're responsible for between each other. Some won't get enough work to do, and they'll demotivate everybody else by their mere existence."***

VK started with PHP and MySQL on Debian Linux, but scaling quickly required optimization. Memcached was added, Apache servers were replaced with Nginx. Initially, Durov's brother was in Germany and could only occasionally help via phone calls to explain installation procedures. **As VK grew past one million users and a dozen servers, surviving without his brother's input became impossible.** The database had to be split across servers, then tables had to be sharded using criteria that wouldn't break user experience.

**DDoS attacks began as VK became popular**, and interestingly, attacks intensified during negotiation days with potential buyers—a clear pattern of pressure tactics. Fighting these attacks required many sleepless nights developing countermeasures. This was the introduction to bad actors, which would later expand to include politics and geopolitics.

When Nikolai returned from Germany around 2008, he and a friend (another world programming contest champion) **rewrote large portions of the data engines in C and C++** for maximum efficiency. This included the search engine, targeted ads engine, private messaging, and public messages. The result was a site that loaded faster than almost anything else online, including Facebook. When Durov met Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's core team in Silicon Valley in 2009, they were curious how VK loaded faster even in Silicon Valley than Facebook did. **The secret was low-level optimization and custom-built engines rather than relying on standard solutions.**

**This philosophy continues at Telegram with approximately 40 core engineers** (including backend, frontend, designers, and system administrators) managing infrastructure of nearly 100,000 servers distributed across continents and data centers. The key insight: **quantity of employees doesn't translate to quality of product—often it's the opposite.** Too many people spend time coordinating rather than producing. Employees without enough work demotivate others and often create problems that don't exist to justify their existence.

**Forcing teams not to hire more people compels automation.** Managing tens of thousands of servers manually would require thousands of employees. Relying on algorithms makes the system more scalable, efficient, reliable, and resilient to changing geopolitics and technology. Automation also increases security—humans are attack vectors. A distributed system that runs automatically has better security, speed, and resilience than one managed by people.

**The responsibility is enormous**: Telegram is used by over a billion people who open it dozens of times daily. A half-second delay multiplied by dozens of opens by a billion users equals centuries or millennia lost for humanity. **Careless developers can introduce inefficiencies that are difficult to track down** because code doesn't announce it could be faster. Every developer must be a craftsman, constantly asking if things can be done more efficiently and simply. This is the art form of programming.

**Firing an engineer can sometimes increase productivity.** With two Android engineers struggling to keep pace, the instinct is to hire a third. But if one engineer is falling behind, complaining, and not assuming responsibility, firing that person can solve the problem—suddenly the remaining engineer is more productive than both were together. The problematic engineer created more issues than they solved. This is counterintuitive but real.

## 9. Hiring Philosophy and Team Building

***"I would only hire a person if I'm ultimately certain it's the best option. If you hire somebody who is maybe a little bit distracted or inexperienced, you may end up with inefficiencies in your codebase that result in tens of millions of dollars of losses."***

Telegram's hiring process centers on **coding competitions and contests**. This aligns with the philosophy that competition leads to progress. To select the most qualified people for specific tasks, what's better than a competition where everyone who wants to join can demonstrate their skills? Winners can be selected, and if there's insufficient data, the contest repeats with another task. Over time, patterns emerge—someone who competed in 10 contests since age 14, winning eight of them, demonstrating consistency across JavaScript, Android Java, and C++, is clearly exceptional.

**Many hires have never worked at big companies**, which is valuable because big companies teach people to shift responsibility. In large organizations, nobody fully understands who gets credit or blame for projects. At Telegram, it's clear. **Competitions provide the closest experience to actual Telegram work.** For example, implementing a tricky animation and redesign for the Android profile page: the open-source Android app allows anyone to work with the code. The contest not only selects the best person but also produces the best solution to the problem, saving development time.

**Telegram's large social media presence among engineers and designers** makes promoting contests easy. There's always a thriving community around these competitions. **The ideal employee is already a Telegram user** with deep understanding of what Telegram represents. Why hire someone from LinkedIn who worked at Google, is used to receiving salary for minimal work, shifts responsibility, sits in endless meetings, and has limited understanding of Telegram? It's nonsensical.

**The selectivity results in slow hiring but exceptional quality.** Team meetings reveal people discussing cutting-edge features with rapid idea generation, prototyping, and implementation. This explains the fast rate of innovation—many features that competitors take years to implement (if ever) are developed quickly at Telegram.

**Working with B players is demotivating for A players.** Everyone can tell if a colleague is competent. When someone asks wrong questions and lags behind, A players feel unable to realize their full potential. Often the issue isn't laziness but **inability to focus on one task for extended periods**—not everyone has this ability. For those who do, working alongside someone distracted is insulting.

**The hiring bar is extremely high because careless developers introduce inefficiencies** that propagate throughout the codebase. Other developers won't know things could be faster—they'll assume it has to be that way. Every developer building any component must constantly ask if it can be done more efficiently and simply. This is the responsibility and the art form.

## 10. Telegram's Encryption and Privacy Architecture

***"We designed Telegram so that no humans, no employees, have any access to private messaging data. No employee can break the system in a way that would allow them to access messages of users."***

Since 2012, when designing Telegram, the goal was ensuring no humans or employees could access private messaging data. **All data on servers is encrypted, with decryption keys split and kept in different legal jurisdictions.** No single government or entity can access the data. Extracting hard drives from any data center yields only encrypted data that is undecipherable.

**Telegram has never shared a single private message with anyone, including governments and intelligence services.** There has never been a leak of data from Telegram—not private messages, not contact lists. The system is designed to make this impossible. Changing it would require rebuilding the system, which won't happen because it would break promises to users. **The principle is fundamental: without the right to privacy, people can't feel fully free and protected.**

**End-to-end encryption was added in 2013 in Secret Chats**, one year and three months ahead of WhatsApp. The Edward Snowden revelations made clear the serious privacy issues. Telegram was already extremely secure, but the goal was ensuring not even Telegram could access user messages. **Making apps open-source on GitHub since 2013** was crucial because people born in Russia don't necessarily inspire trust.

**Secret Chats have limitations**: they don't support very large communities with persistent chat histories, huge one-to-many channels, or bots with lots of incoming messages. Multiple device support becomes tricky, and people can lose shared documents. **This led to a hybrid approach**: users can choose their level of encryption based on use case and requirements. Secret Chats are opt-in for those who want extreme privacy.

**Secret Chats aren't just end-to-end encrypted—they have additional restrictions** that are both feature and limitation. You can't screenshot them or forward any document or message, which isn't necessary for work communication with teams on projects. It became clear different needs exist, and combining both in one chat type loses utility. **Telegram uses Telegram to build Telegram**—no other collaboration tools. When trying to use Secret Chats for sharing large documents and getting work done, it wasn't adapted for it. But for the truly paranoid who don't even trust Telegram and only trust code, Secret Chats are the best option and the most secure means of communication available.

**Telegram is the only popular messaging app with open-source reproducible builds for both Android and iOS.** This is crucial for verification. Apps like WhatsApp have never been open-source, so you don't know what they're doing or how they encrypt messages. **Reproducible builds allow verification that the App Store version corresponds exactly to the GitHub source code.** This transparency is essential for trust and for the claim that Telegram's Secret Chats are the most secure communication method available.

**The entire software stack is built internally from scratch**—not just encryption but everything running on servers. Hardware and software are all done internally, reducing the attack surface. Snowden's revelations taught that open-source tools, modules, and libraries used by everyone often have flaws and security issues that create vulnerabilities. **Building from scratch also ensures maximum efficiency.** But this requires exceptional talent—the team had to recreate database engines, web servers, and entire programming languages. The backend API programming language is entirely built by the team.

## 11. Arrest in France and Kafkaesque Legal Proceedings

***"I arrived in France last year in August just for a short two-day trip and then I see a dozen armed policemen greeting me and asking me to follow them. They read me a list of something like 15 serious crimes that I'm accused of, which was mind-boggling."***

In August of the previous year, Durov arrived in France for a short two-day trip. A dozen armed policemen greeted him at the airport and read a list of approximately 15 serious crimes he was accused of—all allegedly committed by Telegram users, with the claim that he should be responsible. **This was unprecedented—no country, not even authoritarian ones, had done this to any tech leader at this scale.** The economic message sent to the business and tech community is devastating.

**He spent almost four days in police custody** in a small room with no windows, just a narrow concrete bed. During questioning about how Telegram operates (most of which is public information), he was struck by the limited understanding—even lack of understanding—about how technology, encryption, and social media work among those who initiated the investigation.

**The situation is darkly poetic and Kafkaesque**: a tech founder of a platform where a billion people communicate, confined to concrete with no pillow for days, no windows. It recalls Franz Kafka's "The Trial," where a person is arrested for no reason anyone can explain and becomes stuck in a judicial system where nobody—neither the arrested person nor any individual member of the system—fully understands what's happening. Eventually, the person is mentally broken by the system's absurdity.

**If this were a good-faith attempt to fix an issue, there were many ways to reach out to Telegram or Durov personally**, voice concerns, and solve alleged problems conventionally and diplomatically, the way every other country solves problems with Telegram. **France has an "investigative judge" role** uncommon elsewhere—not a trial but an investigation. The judge acts more like a prosecutor, making appeals harder. Restrictions on travel take a long time to appeal.

**The investigation itself should never have been started.** It's an absurd and harmful way of addressing the complicated issue of regulating social media. Objections and appeals were filed, but no hearing date has been given for the appeal because the process is painfully slow—not just for Durov but for everyone, suggesting the system is broken at multiple levels. Other entrepreneurs have shared horror stories about French investigations where businesses were paralyzed by unnecessary actions of investigative judges that proved unjustified and biased. Justice might eventually come from higher courts, but enormous time and energy are lost.

**Initially, Durov couldn't leave France for months.** Now he can travel to Dubai (where Telegram is headquartered) but nowhere else. The experience of those four days in custody—stuck, unable to communicate with important people, not knowing what's happening in the world regarding yourself—reinforced the value of freedom. **The more pressure applied, the more resilient and defiant Durov becomes.** There have been attempts to use his situation to pressure him into blocking channels in other countries and changing how Telegram works. He refused every time and publicly disclosed these attempts.

## 12. French Intelligence Pressure and Political Censorship

***"I was asked to restrict what I see as restriction of freedom of speech in Romania. They asked me whether I would be shutting down or ready to shut down channels on Telegram that supported the conservative candidate or protest against the pro-European candidates."***

While stuck in France, unable to leave for months, Durov was offered a meeting with the head of state foreign intelligence services through a well-known tech entrepreneur. **The meeting involved a request to restrict freedom of speech in Romania.** Romania was preparing for new presidential elections after previous results were cancelled. The French government didn't support the conservative candidate and asked if Durov would shut down Telegram channels supporting the conservative candidate or protesting against pro-European candidates.

**The response was clear**: if there's no violation of Telegram's rules (which prohibit calls to violence), this can't be done. It would be political censorship. Telegram has protected freedom of speech in many countries worldwide, including Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. **"We're not going to start engaging in censorship in Europe, no matter who is asking us."** Durov told the intelligence chief directly: "If you think that because I'm stuck here, you can tell me what to do, you're very wrong. I would rather do the opposite every time."

**A debate about the morality ensued**, and then Durov disclosed the entire conversation publicly because he never signed an NDA and never signs NDAs with such people—he wants to tell the world what's going on. It's shocking that the French government would try to take advantage of this situation to reach political or geopolitical goals. **This is an attempt to humiliate Durov personally and millions of Telegram users collectively.**

**Before Romania, there was Moldova.** In September or October, Durov was approached through an intermediary and asked to take down channels in Moldova due to an upcoming election and fears of interference. A list of channels and bots was provided. Some violated Telegram's rules and were taken down. Then a second list with dozens of channels arrived. **Most had no solid foundation for banning—they were people expressing political views** that Durov might not agree with but that they have the right to express. Telegram refused.

**Interestingly, after banning the few channels that violated rules, the French intelligence services communicated through their contact that they had spoken to Durov's investigative judge and "told the judge good things" about him.** This was confusing and shocking—these two matters have nothing in common. Why would anyone talk to an investigative judge about Moldova when the investigation concerns whether Telegram did enough to remove illegal content in France?

**This raised deep suspicion.** It happened after blocking a few rule-violating channels but before refusing to block the long list of channels that were fine—people expressing political views. That was the moment of realization that more might be going on than initially thought. Initially, it seemed like confusion about how technology works, but after Moldova, suspicion grew about systematic attempts.

**By the time the intelligence chief met to ask about Romania and silencing conservative voices, Durov was already wary.** Ironically, Telegram also received a request from French police to take down a far-left protester channel in France. Telegram refused—peaceful protesters, regardless of whether they lean right or left. **During COVID, Telegram protected activists organizing Black Lives Matter events and protesters against lockdowns.** Telegram protects everybody as long as they don't cross lines into calling for violence or inciting damage to public property. **It's a fundamental right to assemble.**

## 13. Fighting Censorship Globally

***"We would rather lose one market or two markets or pretty much all of the markets. I don't care that much. It won't affect me. It won't affect my lifestyle in any way. I will still be doing my push-ups."***

In 2018, Telegram had approximately 200 million users and was becoming increasingly popular in places like Iran and Russia, where people sometimes have something to hide from governments. **In Iran, people used Telegram to protest against the government** with huge channels organizing protests. The government couldn't keep up and decided to ban Telegram. People kept using it through VPNs. The government invested heavily in creating homegrown messaging apps, with several teams competing for the title of national Iranian messaging app. **All the apps failed. People still preferred Telegram.**

Iran banned Telegram but not WhatsApp (or unbanned WhatsApp soon after). **Starting in late 2017, Russia demanded Telegram hand over encryption keys**, thinking such things existed that would allow reading messages of every Telegram user or at least every Russian user. Telegram explained it was impossible. Russia proceeded with a ban in spring 2018.

**The response was prepared.** Telegram developed technology to rotate IP addresses, replacing them with new ones every time the censor blocked existing addresses. This was completely automated with millions of IP addresses available. **A movement called "Digital Resistance" was created** where system administrators and engineers worldwide (inside and outside Russia) could set up proxy servers and IP addresses for Telegram to bypass censorship. Millions of dollars were spent on this.

**The Russian censor went overboard**, banning IP addresses and huge subnets, which caused parts of the country's infrastructure to go down. People couldn't pay for groceries in supermarkets because the censor blocked too many IP addresses, affecting unrelated services. Russian social networks, media, and banks were affected. The censor had to become more selective.

**The biggest resistance came from Apple.** For at least four weeks, Apple didn't allow Telegram updates in the App Store, saying Telegram had to reach an agreement with Russia first. Telegram refused. Apple said they would allow updates worldwide except Russia. **Telegram didn't want to do that—it would mean abandoning the Russian market and removing the ability of protesters and people who want to talk to have a voice.**

Protests in defense of Telegram, privacy, and freedom of speech were organized in Moscow in 2018, with people flying paper airplanes (Telegram's logo). **Durov published a statement that Apple sided with the censor**, which was picked up by The New York Times with pictures of protesters. Apple was criticized.

**For more than a month, Telegram couldn't update.** A new iOS version made old Telegram versions obsolete, causing features to stop working. Users worldwide (not just Russia) experienced issues. By Friday at 6 PM, Durov decided: if Apple doesn't allow the update, remove Telegram from the Russian App Store to proceed globally. The rest of the world is more important. **Magically, 15 minutes before the deadline, Apple approved the update.** The hide-and-seek game with the censor continued through Digital Resistance.

**Iran required a different approach.** Using IP addresses would be too expensive and might violate sanctions regimes. Instead, **an economic incentive was created for people setting up proxy servers.** Any Iranian engineer could set up a proxy server, distribute its address among Iranian users, and whoever connected through the proxy would see a pinned ad placed by the system administrator. This monetization created a market where **Iranians fixed their own problem.** Telegram is still banned in Iran today, but probably 50 million people use it. **People find a way around.**

## 14. Assassination Attempt Through Poisoning

***"I felt pain all over my body. I tried to get up and go to the bathroom, but while I was going there, I felt that functions of my body started to switch off. First the eyesight, then hearing. Then I had difficulty breathing. Everything accompanied by very acute pain. I thought, 'This is it.'"***

In spring 2018, during the period of raising funds for TON (a blockchain project) while multiple countries were trying to ban Telegram, **Durov experienced what appears to have been a poisoning attempt.** He never talked about this publicly because he didn't want people to freak out, particularly at a time when the company needed to project stability.

**Durov never falls ill—he believes he has perfect health.** He very rarely has headaches or bad coughs and doesn't take pills because he doesn't need them. This was the only instance in his life when he thought he was dying. He came home to his rented townhouse, which had a weird neighbor who had left something around the door. **One hour later, while in bed living alone, he felt very bad—pain all over his body.**

Trying to get up and go to the bathroom, **body functions started switching off: first eyesight, then hearing, then difficulty breathing.** Everything was accompanied by acute pain—heart, stomach, blood vessels. It was difficult to explain, but one thing was certain: this was the end. He couldn't breathe, couldn't see anything, and it was extremely painful. **He thought, "I've had a good life. I managed to accomplish a few things."** Then he collapsed on the floor but doesn't remember it because pain covered everything.

**He found himself on the floor the next day when it was already bright.** He couldn't stand up and was extremely weak. Looking at his arms and body, **blood vessels were broken all over his body**—something that had never happened before. He couldn't walk for two weeks after and stayed at his place, deciding not to tell most of his team because he didn't want them to worry.

**This experience didn't make him more afraid—if anything, he felt even more free after.** It wasn't the first time he thought he was going to die (there was a previous experience related to his work). After surviving something like this, **you feel like you're living on bonus time.** In a way, you died long ago, and every new day is a gift, a bonus. The first instance was in December 2011 during huge protests in Moscow over election integrity. The government demanded VK take down opposition groups used to organize protests. Durov very publicly refused, mocking the prosecutor by posting a scan of the demand next to a photo of a dog in a hoodie with its tongue out, saying it was his official response.

**Armed policemen tried to get into his apartment.** He asked himself if he made the right choice and concluded he did. He asked what would logically follow and realized they would probably put him in prison. He asked himself what he would do about it and told himself **he would starve himself to death.** Many men are ready to die for other people or principles they strongly believe in—Snowden and Assange are examples.

**At that moment, he realized there was no way to communicate securely.** He needed to tell his brother what was going on without betraying him. In 2011, WhatsApp existed (launched 2009) but had zero encryption—all messages were plain text in transit, accessible to system administrators and carriers. **It was only after Telegram started pushing for encryption that other apps suddenly remembered privacy was in their DNA.** Durov told himself: if I survive this, I'm definitely launching a secure messaging app.

## 15. Business Model and Path to Profitability

***"Money has never been the primary goal. When I sold the remaining share of my first company, I reinvested the vast majority of everything in Telegram. Telegram is an operation that is losing money for me personally. I never extracted more from Telegram than I invested in it."***

Durov owns 100% of Telegram with no shareholders—extremely unique for a major tech company. He has invested hundreds of millions of his own money and takes a salary of one-third of one dollar. **2024 was the first year Telegram was profitable.** The company has left enormous amounts of money on the table by sticking to principles—not doing advertisement based on user private data (which every social media company does) and not implementing a newsfeed (the most addictive and engagement-inducing aspect of social media that farms drama and damages the human mind at scale).

**Innovation was required to reach profitability without dubious business activities exploiting personal data.** One idea explored was a subscription model, but only for additional features. All existing features would remain free, with business-related tools or advanced user tools requiring payment of $4-5 per month. This was unprecedented and not considered viable for messaging apps.

**Premium subscriptions launched in 2022 now have over 15 million paid subscribers**, generating more than half a billion dollars in recurring revenue this year and growing fast. This required significant innovation—**over 50 different features were included in the premium package.** Making an app already more powerful than any other messaging app even more useful so people would pay for extras wasn't easy and took enormous effort. Features are constantly added, and every addition must avoid cluttering the app—they're invisible until needed.

**Ads are context-based, not targeted.** Telegram leaves probably 80% of value on the table by refusing to use personal messaging data, contact data, metadata, or activity data to target ads. It's sad this exploitation became synonymous with the internet industry, but Telegram is happy to have achieved profitability despite this.

**Blockchain-based technologies are being experimented with extensively.** Telegram is the first app allowing people to directly own usernames and digital identities using smart contracts and NFTs, removing Telegram from the picture. **Telegram cannot confiscate your username—it's impossible.** The ecosystem includes a thriving mini-app platform with millions of developers launching bots and applications. Many people make millions of dollars on the Telegram platform.

**In-app purchase mechanisms provided by Apple and Google** enable third-party mini-app developers (essentially deeply integrated websites) to receive payments from users. This was the first attempt of this kind on both iOS and Android at this scale. **Telegram extracts a very low 5% commission** from these transactions—not greedy, wanting people to succeed in building tools for users. Many apps bring users, making Telegram more successful and relevant. Third-party developers are needed.

**TON (The Open Network) blockchain** was initially developed in 2018-2019 because existing blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) weren't scalable enough for hundreds of millions of users—they would become congested. Durov asked his brother if they could create an inherently scalable blockchain that splits into smaller "shardchains" no matter how many users or transactions exist. After a few days of thought, the answer was yes, but it wouldn't be easy. They succeeded in developing the technology, but **the SEC was unhappy with how the TON fundraise was conducted, forcing abandonment of the project.** The open-source community took over, and the project launched without direct involvement as "The Open Network."

**TON is thriving now.** Blockchain-based tokenized Telegram usernames and accounts are all based on TON and its smart contracts. It's the only way for third-party developers and creators to withdraw funds earned through revenue-sharing programs (50/50 split of ad revenues with channel owners). It's the only way to transact on Telegram—buying ads requires using TON. New launches like Telegram Gifts (reinvented, socially relevant NFTs integrated into a billion-user ecosystem but available on-chain and transferable) are based on TON. **As a result, TON has become the largest or second-largest blockchain in terms of daily NFT trading volumes.**

## 16. Design Philosophy and User Experience

***"If you do the animation, if you throw the animation first and then the messages move closer to each other, it doesn't feel right. It feels too long, too imposing. So what you want to do is you want the message to disappear while the messages around it go closer to each other to fill the resulting gap."***

Telegram's design philosophy obsesses over every small detail that counts to achieve a user experience where, after using Telegram regularly for a few weeks, **going back to any other messaging app feels like a serious downgrade.** The moving gradient background of every Telegram chat is something most people don't consciously notice, but they can feel it—there's a pleasant feeling when reading a chat. The gradient contributes to that feeling.

**Creating that feeling efficiently is incredibly challenging.** Countless algorithms could render the gradient inefficiently. Doing it efficiently but not beautifully can result in noticeable lines. Certain randomness must be introduced. The gradient alone isn't enough—it's too plain. A pattern overlay is needed, but it must be simple enough not to distract from content yet entertaining enough to create good feelings. Questions arise: what objects to include, how the pattern works, pixel-based or vector-based? **Vector-based is chosen for infinite scalability and high quality.**

**For the default pattern and background based on four colors** (not two), which constantly shift, Durov probably looked through several thousand variations because it's such an important decision—it's the default background (though customizable with your own four colors). **The choice relies on deeply hardcoded biological properties of the human mind.** Which color—blue, yellow, green? Each has different meaning in our brains. What objects—something from childhood, nature, or creating different moods? This is just one detail of the app.

**When sending a message, the input field slowly morphs into the actual message.** This must work regardless of message contents—different widths, media, link previews, other elements changing the message bubble. Countless scenarios must work perfectly, even with 4,000-character messages. All platforms (iOS, Android), all old devices, all outdated operating systems, all hardware combinations must be tested. **Telegram works on tablets, and the iOS version works on iPad**, which Durov loves. Everything can be really big, consuming lots of screen space, triggering more computational resources for rendering.

**The message evaporation animation (Thanos snap effect)** breaks messages into tens of thousands of particles that disappear like dust in the wind. It looks great but was extremely hard to make, particularly on Android. **It's pure art.** But animations can't distract from communication—they must be invisible in a way, creating feeling without distraction. The deletion effect requires even more challenges: if the animation plays first, then surrounding messages move closer, it feels too long and imposing. **The message must disappear while surrounding messages move closer to fill the gap simultaneously.** This involves redrawing the entire screen on top of very complicated animation, considering all kinds of messages before and after, on all devices, operating systems, tablets, phones, desktops.

**Once accomplished, it gives immense pride because nobody else is doing this.** Maybe nobody cares, maybe nobody notices, but there's something wrong about neglecting such things. Every day, tens of millions of people delete messages. What experience do they get? **Does it inspire them, make their heart sing, fill them with joy, lighten their mood even by 0.001%?** Or is it just basic? If we can bring value and joy to people's lives through subtle details, we must invest time in it.

**Stickers launched three years and eight months ahead of WhatsApp**, but WhatsApp's first version used regular GIFs or WebM videos, not vector graphics. **Telegram uses vector animations—each sticker is only several kilobytes (maximum 20-30 KB) but has 180 frames running at 60 FPS on all devices.** This was crazily difficult—nobody tried anything like this before. The result: fluid animations, nice user experience, instant loading because stickers are lightweight, instant movement.

**Finding designers able to create vector-based stickers required competitions.** Assembling a team of artist-engineers capable of this unique art form wasn't easy. This allowed revolution in stickers, then animated emoji that can be added into messages (custom animated emoji). **Telegram is probably still the only platform allowing this**—you can include 100 animated emoji in a message, they'll all animate and move, and your device won't crash. It's probably unnecessary and crazy, but **true quality is created at the intersection of art and engineering.**

## 17. TON Blockchain and Telegram Gifts

***"We only launched Telegram Gifts half a year ago, and now as a result, TON has become the largest or second-largest blockchain in terms of daily NFT trading volumes."***

TON (The Open Network) is a Layer 1 blockchain technology initially developed by Telegram in 2018-2019. **The need arose because existing blockchains weren't scalable enough** for hundreds of millions of Telegram users—Bitcoin and Ethereum would become congested. Durov asked his brother Nikolai if they could create an inherently scalable blockchain that splits into smaller "shardchains" regardless of user or transaction volume. After consideration, Nikolai said yes, but it wouldn't be easy.

**Development succeeded, but the SEC's unhappiness with the TON fundraise forced project abandonment.** Fortunately, because Telegram constantly conducted contests for third-party developers, a thriving community existed around TON. The open-source community took over, launching the project without direct Telegram involvement as "The Open Network" (previously "Telegram Open Network").

**The project is thriving.** Blockchain-based tokenized Telegram usernames and accounts are all based on TON and its smart contracts. **It's the only way for third-party developers and creators to withdraw funds** earned through revenue-sharing programs (e.g., 50/50 split of ad revenues with channel owners). It's the only way to transact on Telegram—buying ads requires using TON.

**Telegram Gifts represent reinvented, socially relevant NFTs** integrated into a billion-user ecosystem while remaining available on-chain, transferable, and directly owned. They're based on TON. **Launched only half a year ago, Telegram Gifts made TON the largest or second-largest blockchain in daily NFT trading volumes.**

**The first major celebrity collaboration was with Snoop Dogg.** Durov is a big fan, so when approached to do something together, he suggested launching Snoop-related gifts. **Within 30 minutes, $12 million worth of gifts were sold.** Many high-profile influencers are now requesting collaborations.

**Each gift is a beautiful piece of art** encapsulating certain memes and aspects of the celebrity that everyone knows—cultural icons they represent. The incredible detail of individual gifts is possible because they're vector-based and scalable. Each gift references points in the artist's creative biography and has countless versions—**over 50 distinctive versions of each were created.** Each individual piece is unique with unique background and icon.

**This reinvents old-school NFTs**, which weren't socially relevant (where do you demonstrate them?) and were often ugly, not based on sophisticated technology. **Telegram Gifts appear next to your name as part of your digital identity**, and you can create collections displayed on your profile page. The aesthetic is beautiful and pleasing while being technologically accurate in references to the specific artist's biography—**a mixture of art and technology that's quite rare.**

**The reception was surprising.** Early collections sold each piece at around $5. The minimum price of any items in these collections is currently around $10,000 and keeps rising. **People love these gifts**—they can congratulate someone close with something valuable and beautiful. Some people make businesses reselling gifts. One person earned several million dollars in a few months buying and selling gifts. Another earned $12 million from mini-apps last year. Several people earned $10 million or $3 million in just months, sometimes single-handedly or with teams of two or three people. **Hearing stories of people building businesses on Telegram makes Durov incredibly proud.**

## 18. Sperm Donation and Legacy Planning

***"At a certain point in my life about 15 years ago, I decided that it was a good idea to be a sperm donor. I can't say I'm incredibly proud of that, but I think it was the right thing to do."***

There's confusion over how many biological children Durov has—often said to be over 100. **The truthful answer is he doesn't really know** because about 15 years ago, he decided to be a sperm donor. Initially, a friend asked for help because he and his wife experienced health issues preventing natural conception. They didn't want random anonymous genetic material—they wanted someone they knew and respected to be the biological father.

**Durov's initial reaction was disbelief—it sounded ridiculous.** But he realized it was a serious issue, and they weren't the only couple struggling. Eventually, he was persuaded to do more. He can't say he's incredibly proud of it, but **he thinks it was the right thing to do**, particularly at a time when he thought he probably didn't have much time left on the planet as things were getting trickier. If he could help couples have babies, why not?

**More recently, when working on his will, he realized he shouldn't distinguish between naturally conceived children and biological children he's never seen.** As long as they can establish shared DNA someday (maybe in 30 years), **they must be entitled to a share of his estate after he's gone.** This made a lot of noise in the news—people get excited by such news. He received many messages from people claiming to be his kids and requests to adopt them. The memes were priceless.

**He doesn't see anything wrong with it—if anything, more people should donate sperm.** The bold financial decision was treating all children equally. Interestingly, **they don't receive any money for the first few decades of their life.** The reasoning: **overabundance paralyzes motivation and willpower.** It's extremely harmful, particularly for young boys, to grow up in an environment where they can be proud of their father's achievements and wealth rather than their own. This removes incentive to develop skills, study, and work.

**If they're going to have this money, it should come when they're already adults.** It's still risky, but one reason for dividing huge wealth among 100+ people is that it won't be too much for each descendant. However, calculations show it's still many millions of dollars per child, so it may not help too much in preventing the problems of abundance.

## 19. Mouse Paradise Experiment and Dangers of Abundance

***"We have evolved to overcome scarcity almost by definition. There's never been such thing as infinite amount of food or entertainment in our lives before. Now we seem as a species to lose our ability to identify purpose in a world where you have everything and everything loses its meaning."***

The Mouse Paradise Experiment (Universe 25), conducted by ethologist John B. Calhoun in the 1960s and early 1970s, provided a few hundred mice with unlimited food, water, nesting, no predators, stable temperatures, and frequent cleaning—**the definition of abundance as far as mice go.** Initially, the population doubled and grew quickly. But then it leveled off, and negative social phenomena emerged: **mothers neglected or killed their young, violent attacks and hypersexual activity became widespread, and "beautiful ones" (largely inactive, well-groomed mice) withdrew, refusing to mate or interact.**

**Reproduction rates crashed, social dysfunction spread to the next generation, and the population plummeted steadily to zero** despite ongoing resource abundance. The last mice died surrounded by untouched food and water. **The deep wisdom is that scarcity, constraints, and non-abundance seem essential for flourishing**—a counterintuitive notion.

**This is true for mice and probably true for humans.** We evolved to overcome scarcity almost by definition—there's never been infinite food or entertainment in our lives before. Now we seem to lose our ability to identify purpose in a world where we have everything and everything loses its meaning. **Restrictions are important, but they should come from within—self-restriction rather than external restriction to create purpose and meaning.**

**Durov was lucky in a counterintuitive way because he grew up poor.** He didn't have money as a teenager, wore the same secondhand jacket for years, his father wouldn't receive salary for months because the Russian state was almost bankrupt, and his mom juggled two jobs. It wasn't easy, but **it created purpose, meaning, and priorities. It allowed focus on things that mattered and development of character and intellectual abilities.** If they had everything, why do anything?

**The mice suffered irreversible societal collapse—not an accident.** This experiment has been repeated countless times. At a certain point, **social dysfunction and erosion of social roles become contagious, and society gradually degrades into a chaotic collection of individuals unable to care for or produce the next generation, leading to extinction.**

**This is fascinating because we're creating technologies—AI proposes this to future generations as a problem to solve.** AI may well create abundance. Whether AI or other technologies increase quality of life and decrease suffering, as we reach toward abundance, **the fabric connecting us rooted in our biology developed by evolution might create a real challenge.** We must find the right balance between chaos and order, between self-restriction and freedom for creativity.

## 20. Lessons from Father and Leading by Example

***"You shouldn't give the wrong example to the people around you and in particular to your kids because you can do the right thing nine times out of 10, but you make a mistake once and they will instantly copy it."***

Durov's father recently celebrated his 80th birthday, and they had a conversation where his father gave life advice. One key lesson: **not to just speak of principles but to live them, to lead by example.** Durov is incredibly lucky to have his father, who wrote countless books on ancient Rome and Roman literature and dozens of scientific papers. **He always remembers his father working**—typing books and articles on an old-school typewriter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was relentless.

**The example he set was priceless.** Some people mistakenly think they can instill right principles in future generations or children by saying things to them. **But kids are smart—they discount words and look at actions.** Observing their father was a big lesson by itself. It wasn't necessary for him to say anything.

**His father was incredibly patient and emotionally resilient.** Durov's mother (a great, incredibly smart, highly educated woman) would sometimes test his father's patience—there's an evolutionary explanation for why women sometimes do that. **He demonstrated incredible patience all the time.**

**His father told him recently that you shouldn't give the wrong example** to people around you, particularly your kids, because you can do the right thing nine times out of ten, but make a mistake once, and they'll instantly copy it. **If you're telling your kids not to use a smartphone but you're using one all the time** and coming up with sophisticated explanations why they shouldn't, it won't land—it's bound to fail. **You lead by example.**

**Numerous lessons include staying positive, looking at the bright side, never despairing, and being honest.** His father told him last time they spoke that **AI can have consciousness and be creative, but it cannot have conscience**—it cannot be moral, cannot have deeply rooted principles, cannot have integrity in the way humans understand it.

**Durov loves that he's talking to his 80-year-old father about AGI** and the difference between human spirit, human nature, and what AGI/AI can achieve. **Conscience—the ability to know right from wrong—is the lesson his father gave him.** One of Durov's goals in life is never to disappoint his father.
