DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
Jimbo's joined by Duncan Alexander, Tom Williams and Colin Millar to take stock after a night of pure drama at Blundell Park as Manchester United suffered the indignity of being dumped out of the League Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.

We dial up a Mariners fan - actor, presenter and comedian Lloyd Griffith - and The Athletic's Manchester United reporter Laurie Whitwell to discuss the extraordinary scenes in Cleethorpes as Ruben Amorim's side plumbed new depths.

Then we turn out attention to the weekend's Premier League action - headlined by the small matter of Liverpool v Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. How will Liverpool's defensive chaos match up with Arsenal's more measured approach to these big games?

Elsewhere, can Tottenham continue their eye-catching start to the season under Thomas Frank when they host Bournemouth? Which Man City will we see at Brighton? And just how bad are West Ham ahead of their trip to the City ground on Sunday?

All that plus - age gap passes, m

Totally Football Show today. Winner winner chicken dinner. Grimby Town have Man United on toast in the Carabar Cup. Meanwhile, when you're out in round two to a team from League 2. That's a more him. We ask what's next for United's Underfire boss. Elsewhere, Lord Al Mati. There's new faces in the Champions League, but no Scottish sides after Celtic and Rangers misadventures this week. and we preview Premier League match day three, Liverpool, Arsenal, and with an international break looming, who could soon be packing their bags? It's the Totally Football Show. Thursday the 28th of August, just after a midweek that was not kind to managers who are wedded to their philosophies uh in the Champions League playoffs, disaster for Rangers. Duncan Alexander's here with us. >> Hello. in the Carab Cup for Reuben Amarim and Manchester United. Tom Williams also here with us. >> Hello James. >> And Colin Miller as well. What to say about Wednesday night at Grimby Town. >> Good, wasn't it? >> Extraordinary. >> At first I thought maybe IV and Sky broadcasting the fixture was too much, but if anything, we needed a third broadcaster. So, >> well, let's see what we can add to the picture. Now, if you missed it, Manchester United Football Club, I think we'll add that in this instance. who were only in this round of the Carabai Cup because they finished 15th last season and failed to qualify for Europe went to fourth tier Grimby Town and League 2 Grimby Town who play in League 2 promptly knocked them out after a penalty shootout. It was a proper United lineup as well, Tom. Well, in the sense that it was of course uh the uncontestable 3421 formation, lots of changes to the starting 11, but nevertheless a group of players who should have been able to play with, I was going to say a degree more coherence, multiple degrees of more coherence than they managed. And just a brilliant, brilliant cup tie, biblical reign at the start of the second half. Um and yeah, an absolutely fantastic underdog performance and yet more problems for poor old belleaguered Ruben Amarin. >> Yeah, we mentioned on Sunday Amarim's floor stare of despair during the Fulham draw Wednesday night. Spent the shootout at the end of the game stood not with his staff but alone. Sat on the bench head in hands, shaking quietly. Colin, worrying times. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, as Tom said, the the sort of thunderstorm backdrop to this match kind of made it kind of gave it that cup tie vibe, didn't it, with the epic penalty shootout at the end. And there was so many there's so many moments in that shootout as well that there's so many sort of talking points within it that made it really interesting. >> Well, we'll get on to those because to tell us more about the magnificent Mariners Grimby Town, we're joined now by Grimby fan and former soccer am host Lloyd Griffith. Lloyd, hello. >> Oh, good morning. How are you? >> Yeah, I'm very well. Are you outside a train station? >> I am outside the train station at Cleobs, which uh is where Grimby actually play. Um yeah, I'm jumping on a train about 15 minutes to go back to to London. If I'm being brutally honest, I didn't think that I would need to do the media rounds this morning. I thought it'd be a close shop. You know what I mean? We got thumped for the last time. I can have a lie, maybe a couple of pints. I've been up since 7:00 doing Radio 4, five live. You know, it's it's it's a lovely story as you just alluded to. Like it's a proper underdog victory and the whole town is buzzing this morning. People wearing their shirts, car horns going off. It's it's a lovely atmosphere. >> Everywhere you look, it's winner winner chicken dinner as the the famous motto of Grimsby Town run. >> It is one of the famous mottown. I mean uh it's one of our mottos. It's been around since 1878 actually. That motto >> fish not enough for you, is it? >> Look, it's all about um protein >> and you got your just desserts uh against Man United Lloyd. Extraordinary action. So you were on holiday in Malta and cut your holidays short to get back for the game. Almost didn't make it. >> Yeah. It was it was it was a situation where I mean I I didn't necessarily have the second round of the Carib Cup in my diary. Um so when me and my partner decided to go to Malta, it wasn't something that I needed to really factor in. And then when you get drawn at home to Manchester United isn't something you have to factor into a relationship. It's like how do I brooch? can I come back to Grimby for this? And so, bless her, she uh let me well, I say let me, I mean, you know, we're, you know, she's she's a lovely lady. Um, but as in she was like, "Yeah, fine. Let's cut our holiday short." So, I came back um via Manchester. She went back to Gatwick and yeah, a friend of mine picked me up and, you know, we haven't played each other since 1948. It's, you know, we spent a lot of time in in the top flight um of English football, but we just never played Manchester United since 1948. So, um, it was, uh, it was a game I just wasn't wasn't going to miss. >> Can you believe what you witnessed, Lloyd? The going two up the thinking you had a third and that shootout that was epic. What was it 20 minutes long? >> Yeah, 20 minutes long. I mean, it did really have everything. I mean, you say you had the biblical storm in the second half like a lot of the lads that and and I sit with my mom in the upper um, sorry, the upper Ramston's home furnishings stand um, as it's called this year. Um and the lad in front of us, he works at the dock and um he got an alert from one of his mates on a boat be like there's a flash storm coming. I was like what? And then we were following it following this storm and then it was just it was great. I mean we were two nil up at Halime and we said at halftime look no matter what happens obviously going to have to make changes cuz they're losing to Grimby Town. Whatever happens we've had this 45 minutes and we we ran them off the park. Like there's no denying it. I'm not sure if you saw the whole game, but we absolutely dominated Premier League Manchester United for a full 60 minutes and it was lovely. Obviously, they brought on Bruno Fernandez and you know, it swung back into their kind of like favor and then to go to penalties, you know, the scoreboard says 12-11. So, you know, it does look like we won 1211 after 95 minutes if you look at the scoreboard. But yeah, it's um I I've never seen in life penalties go on for that long. from Christy Pim, the hero, the Grimby down goalkeeper who told Natalie Jedra afterwards that he's actually a Man United fan and saved that well Kuna's second penalty because it went round of course the the shootout. What a what a what a moment like the um extraordinary pitch invasion. What a joyous encapsulation of just pure sporting joy that was. >> Yeah, and it was it was it was a moment where it did just keep going on and we we we weren't sure how it was going to end. Then I think you know when when when we got to like the second round of penalties is like look if if we go out here we've held our heads up high and also I have to say like probably quite difficult for Man United to do their research on Grimby Town penalty takers when Henry Brown bless him I think has played five senior games for Manchester United and hasn't taken a penalty in his you know professional career that how is an earner doing homework for that. So um look if Manchester United want Christy Pim I don't work for the club but I'm sure I can broker that deal. 35 million quid is yours. Um, but it was it was amazing. Then then the pitch invasion. I mean, it was it was it was everything you want in a in in a cup tie. Um, and I I still the dust hasn't really settled. I'm talking about it and, you know, doing various interviews. But I think when I got on the train and just kind of have a little moment, I'll think, "Oh, wow. That actually happened. I'm just going to devour every interview, every highlight package there is going on that train. It's ah, it's one for the ages." >> Magnificent. Lloyd, you've got a train coming up and about seven interviews to do before that. So, we'll let you go and maybe holidays permitting, we'll speak to you after the third round against Sheffield Wednesday. >> I am not putting any holidays into my diary for that week. Um, if I am, I I will be going to Sheffield on my holiday. So, um, where actually weirdly my other half is from, so it might actually work out in my favor this time around. >> All right. >> So, um, but yeah, thanks for having me and um, up the Mariners. >> Magnificent. Thank you so much, Lloyd. Have a great trip. >> Cheers. >> Cheers, mate. Thank you, >> Lloyd Griffith, who was uh, certainly in a good mood this this Thursday morning.  a hoop >> indeed. So that pitch invasion really was I think a beauty especially because it was on a greasy pitch. So you have people tumbling left, right and center and such was the mood of goodnatured pitch invasion. >> It was so good naturatured that did you see the TV director >> to see for once rather than scenes the commentator instantly condemns. Right. Good joy not not bad joy. There was one young waif who approached a TV camera only to be shouldered out the way by a young fellow who wanted to try a knee slide on national television. It failed, but then the director so so was the mood of of Bonomi that the director just stayed on and said, "Have another go." And he got his moment. >> Knees slide followed by a Steven Gerard style camera snog. So ticking off multiple professional footballer celebrations. Well done that man. >> And Lloyd was saying about the the shootout and that they're feeling that whatever happens, we've done ourselves proud. It was really noticeable how the faces the faces of tension even when Man United were ahead in the shootout that you looked on the Grimsy Town bench and the manager was smiling and chuckling the players were grinning rofully at times but grinning anyway whereas you you again you looked on Man United's bench and it was just a pit of despair. the body language throughout the throughout the shootout and throughout much of the match was completely different and I think the way I mean obviously if you're if you're a fan in that stadium you're a Grimy Town fan I mean this is this that was a night that you're never going to forget that that you're always going to have that no matter what happens the rest of the season from the years that are going to come by you're always going to have those moments and you're never going to forget it and that's obviously obviously what makes football so special for a lot of people when you're following a team week in week out and you get those moments obviously the flip side of it is probably the much bigger story in the went away. >> Wow. >> Um and obviously James you mentioned the ribbon amar and body language uh during the shootout but his interview after the match was >> was I thought extraordinary. What did he say? Um he said that you know he said to multiple uh media outlets I thought the players spoke really loudly today and then he said something has to change and you're not going to change 22 players again. >> Lori Whitwell was also in Clethor for the match and he joins us now. Hey Lori. >> Hi guys. How you doing? >> Very very well. Lori, the opening two games of the Premier League season haven't been kind to Manchester United, but this, how would you describe this? >> Yeah, and a dear uh yeah, unprecedented. It was kind of wild to be in this stadium and witnessing uh this event, you know, the rain pouring down. There's so many different aspects to it to kind of unpick, but I I think you're right there in terms of Ruben Amarin's statements after the game being the most important kind of most uh relevant to what happens next because it certainly seemed to me that he was hinting at at least talks about his future if not even one step further and potentially him offering his position because he's touched on that before where the last season we reported on the Athletic at the time and then he spoke to us in Chicago about that situation saying that you know it more about him than the club in terms of whether it would continue or not. Now maybe that's him speaking with the emotion of having witnessed that game and certainly he is a manager who feels a lot during the game and then afterwards um and maybe you know in the coming days he'll calm down and sort of be more reflective if that is indeed what he was hinting at but he was given opportunity to clarify and and you kind of kept it fairly cryptic. So, um, yeah, but it kind of feels like a pretty significant event for Manchester United, a historic event, and and where that leaves Ruben Amarind and this team and this club and this regime, uh, I don't really know. >> But you certainly wouldn't rule out a change coming potentially in the international break that's coming up after this weekend. >> Yeah, I I think everything's option, everything's open at the moment, you know, because of the way that Amarin was speaking. I think he could have diffused the situation, said, listen, it's a really bad night. Maybe he felt he had to be so strong because it was such a bad occasion. But I feel that him speaking on those terms does bring it into the realms of possibility. Let's see. You know, previously when he's done this, um the club have, you know, persuaded him not to and and kind of backed him, you know, with signings and kind of support, but um yeah, I feel like, you know, maybe it's different this time. Maybe it's not, you know, initial signings that I'm getting would be surprised perhaps if he does depart, but um I think we're in the realms of at least talking about it right now. >> Right. Sometimes managers can say that kind of thing as almost as a challenge either to the club or to the players, but everything about his body language just not just on Wednesday night, but throughout this this start of the season suggest that he's deeply unhappy to be in charge of that team. Ruben Amarim certainly gets fingers pointed at him over his uh tactical inflexibility, but he wasn't the only one uh who shoulders the blame for Wednesday's defeat. I was going to say Andre Onana might not be feeling too happy with his return to the first team. >> No. Yeah, obviously that was the big talking point from the start of the season who would be in goal. Alai Bayindi was selected by Ruben Amarin and Ronaldo wasn't even in the squad for the Arsenal game back on the bench at Fulham and now starting his first game getting his first minutes of the season and yeah it was a disaster wasn't it? I mean the first goal letting it slip through his hands and then it looked like he was trying to atone for the for the second goal sort of getting in the mix on the players and yeah it's a difficult situation maybe for a goalkeeper to uh to totally um be powerful on but yeah to to to look that bad against um you know league to opposition I think is is yeah a daming and diamond really of where United are at with the goalkeepers and at least he scored his penalty shall we say that because then the penalty shootouts you know he had that one save that was a really good save but And for me, he just kept diving really strongly to his left, you know, repeatedly. And even then, the ones that he got his hand to, he wasn't strong enough on. I mean, I guess penalties are a bit of a hostage to fortune, but it didn't fill you with confidence. So, yeah, I mean, that's another area that they're going to have to look at, and they are obviously, you know, in talks with Antwerp for Senate Lammonds, the the 23-y old goalkeeper. Um, but it's a it's a big situation to come in if they do pull that deal off. um you know to to then a young lad that has had one full season at Antwor to kind of come into this you know I say unprecedented atmosphere >> talking of the shootout Lori uh what do we make of Cesco being the final outfield player to take one that seems a bit odd for a big new number nine signing right >> have you not got a stat for us there on on the the the last time a you know 70 odd million pound signing was the 10th penalty taker the last outfield penalty taker in a shootout on his first appearance um got to be got to be a unique occasion that as well Right. Yeah. I mean, I'm going to steal another stat from my colleague Mark Critley who said that apparently he's converted 11 of his 11 penalties uh that he's taken in in regulation football. So, for him to be it's not like he he doesn't take penalties. Um I I guess were they trying to protect him a little bit in case he did miss and then became the story? Um but I think really you should be having a striker take a penalty earlier than that. I mean to be fair, you know, United Harry Magguire who as a central defender is actually really good at penalties. Diego Dalow as well is is converted in penalty shootouts before but I'd probably put Cesco ahead of Matias Dick right and I know Dick scored but you're sort of thinking surely the guy that you spent all this money on should be higher up the order but yeah it was another curious anomaly of of a night of many anomalies >> it was another of the players who United have spent a lot of money on this summer who uh missed then his second penalty to seal Grimby's passage to the next round it's Burnley at Old Trafford this weekend Lori they couldn't could they >> well I thought that coming to Grimby um you know on my drive over here uh long old drive I was over in Anglesia on a family holiday and I thought I need I need to get to Grimsy just in case something happens and I'm currently here in Clethorps hearing the sea seagulls chirp right next to Blund Park actually um and so yeah I thought that couldn't happen it did so I'm not wring anything off with this Manchester United team now um yeah in a weird way I kind of feel like they would prefer a big team to go up against in the next game because they could get themselves up for it I kind of worry that Burnley at home at Old Trafford. He sort of might be another one of these, I don't know, lethargic performances. That was what Amaram was really uh agitated about last night. The fact that they didn't, you know, start the game with intensity. He he was really on it from from the kickoff, you know, kind of trying to instruct them where to be, which again you can maybe get into in terms of is that the best thing for this group of players, having a head coach that is so uh particular about positioning at this particular stage. But uh yeah, I mean Burnley obviously coming off the back of a good win um in their second game, you know, in the Premier League season. So, you know, they look like they've got a little bit about them at least. You know, United have to win this game really. I mean, maybe it's still becomes a footnote in in the wider picture, but I certainly think that, you know, it would be an absolute, you know, cataclysmic start to the season if they were to lose this one. >> Burnley beat Derby 2-1 at Turf Moore on Tuesday in the Caribbe Cup. You got to head off Lauria. Are you heading back to Anglesy now? >> I am indeed. Yes. 4hour drive awaits me. point out Angles to Cleops back to Anglesy is one of the greatest sort of journeys anyone's ever made in this country I think >> really in terms of what seafront >> pure west to east back to west >> west to east yeah it's the most it's ridiculous when the draw was made and I realized I was already going to be away on this holiday I just thought I've never been to Grimby before I'm never probably going to watch a match at Blund Park you know with United certainly being there it had all this ingredients for this occasion and and as it transpired obviously not for positive reasons for United but it was a spectacle to be there. So, I'm glad I made the journey. I've got some energy just about for the trip back, although sort of 4 hours sleep for fuel. I might need a couple of Red Bulls on the way. >> Lori, we're so glad that you went along and many, many thanks for joining us today. >> Thanks so much for having me, guys. Cheers. >> Kira Maguire putting up an interesting chart. Did you see this on social media on Thursday morning? Grimby versus Man United financial comparisons. Uh you can pick out loads of things in the percentage difference column that he's put, but I I personally like total squad cost, which Man United's is 1.27 billion and a bit. Uh Grimby's is a bit and the percentage difference is 483 451%. >> Big old percentage. >> It certainly is. I don't want to go uh you know full little England but I do sometimes think that overseas managers underestimate the strength of the pyramid in England and because Aaron kept saying after the game this is a fourth division team which in Port >> which one was he referring to >> very fairy fair league 2 is a strong league and yeah I think compared to a country like Portugal or you know Holland or someone like that these teams can are you know I think they surprise managers sometimes but I think all through the game his his body language as as Colin said was >> just weird like he didn't watch the penalty shootout. He had his tactics board during extra time which he was oh not not extra he had his tactics board later on in the game which he was shuffling around but I mean I don't understand what what was that what was he doing felt potentially like the precise moment at which he became a meme and that is never a good moment for any manager and I think the tactics board is is key because it strikes at the heart of the problem and the big problem for Amarim is that he's looking through the wrong end of the telescope the questions he should be asking are how do I make this team better? How do I fit these players into the positions where they will be able to play their best football? But the only question he seems to be asking is how do I fit these players into my preferred 3421 formation? You take the case of Kobe Manu for example, probably the most talented footballer to have come through the United Academy since Marcus Rashford. now looks like he's going to have to leave against his his own will pretty much if he wants to get first team football somewhere. The problem that Amarim has created for himself is that he's decided that Fernandez and and Mayu cannot play alongside each other in the midfield too. But because he's signed ao and uh Kuna in the window, Fernandez has to drop deeper. a slightly more experienced manager or a less dogmatic manager would think, well, Fernandez kind of needs two pairs of legs alongside him. I'll pick Mayu and someone else, you know, Ugati or Casemiro or whoever. But because it has to be 3421, Mayu is basically going to be forced out of the club, a club that he loves, a club where he is adored by the fans, having shown he's good enough purely because of this tactical straight jacket that the manager has decided to fit himself in. Unless, as we were hinting, there is a change on that front over the next day or two, week or two, Colin. >> Yeah. Well, well, this is this is a point I think does need to be made is that you're now talking about Amarim's future and how long is that going to last, but Manchester United have what at the time of recording four, five days left of the transfer window and they're desperate to sell players that specifically is down to the system that Amarim has the players that he does and doesn't want. And not just that, but as as Tom said, I mean, those players include Alejandro Granacho, Kobe Manu, players who came through the academy. And when we talk about Manchester United and the the attachment they have to the youth system and the players that come through and the players that do mean something to the club and I know that there's extenduating circumstances and a case- by case basis but fundamentally they've been trying to sell both of those players since January because they don't fit Amarim system. So if they're going to if Amar's going to leave and there's going to be a new system would all of a sudden they want those players again. I mean this is this is come probably the worst possible moment for Manchester United as a club in deciding what is going to happen. Not just in the next week, but in the next in the next seasons coming ahead. >> Worst possible moment so far. I think you >> match day three of the Premier League kicks off Saturday lunchtime. Chelsea against Fulham. That'll be fun. 3:00 games are Wolves against Everton. Spurs Bournemouth. Manchester United Burnley and Sunderland Brenford who are having their first top flight meeting since May 1947. 5:30 on Saturday, Leadeds take on Newcastle. Brighton Man City is the is one of the two o'clock games on Sunday. The other being Nottingham Forest against West Ham where there's also a significant degree of pressure on the manager Graeme Potter at 4:30 on Sunday. Last season's top two Liverpool and Arsenal face off at Anfield and that's followed by a 7:00 game. It's Aston Villa against Crystal Palace. Why Duncan? >> Why indeed? >> The suits say it's because of Palace's sudden involvement in the Conference League. They have to stick it on a Sunday night. >> Well, we saw this invented as a concept last season with teams playing on Thursday night and finding out that they can suddenly move games to Sunday at 7:00. It's not fun for anyone, is it? >> It's a very co era match thought, isn't it? But that was that was the match thought that Aston Villa whenever they beat Liverpool 72 was a late Sunday match. So, let's not let's not write off the Villa Park 7:00. >> I mean, Villa Park does I mean you mentioned Project Restart. I mean, obviously the Hawkeye occlusion was at Villa Park. So, it's got some heritage. Hawkeye occlusion. >> Good. Good. >> What the Wikipedia page is called. I believe >> remind us about the Hawkeye occlusion. >> Well, there were too many people on the goal line. So although uh Sheffield United should have scored, >> Hawkeye would just kind of shrugged and went >> exploded. Sorry. >> If if Big Sam was still Premier League managing, he would have tacticked that up and installed a certain number of defenders on the goal line for any chance. just well headlining that set of fixtures without doubt is Liverpool against Arsenal. Last season's top two. Both clashes last season ended 2-2. This is actually the Premier League fixture that's provided the most goals in the last decade. 78 in 20 matches, which is what sort of three and a half a game. Uh Liverpool on Monday certainly doing their best to suggest that kind of goalc scoring activity will continue because they once again conceded a couple of goals for the fourth game in a row in fact in their trip to Newcastle. Once again they got away with it but against a 10-man Newcastle in Newcastle with no strikers. The positives were few and far between. I do think these are the two strongest teams in the league. I think that ultimately it's it's going to go headtohead with for the title. But I do think what's so interesting about this clash isn't just that. the sort of stylistic differences and we've just seen that already in the couple of opening games that Liverpool are just so open defensively and we we've always obviously spoke about the amount of money they've invested and Arsenal have as well of course in the window but Liverpool have invested it in attack-minded players front footed players and that includes both fullbacks obviously Mos Kirz and Jeremy Friong and I think Kirz has really struggled to to adapt because obviously he he did so well at Bournemouth >> but that's in a slightly different system and in a slightly different dynamic whereas when you're at Liverpool and obviously you've obviously They've had Andy Robertson in that position for years sort of bombing down. But you also have to have that sort of defensive discipline and positional awareness as well. And I think that just takes a bit of time especially for defenders to bed in with new teammates into a new system and with new expectations as well of exactly what's required of you. And I think that that has sort of maybe exposed a little bit of Ibrahim Kate's sort of vulnerabilities as well. I think he's he's struggled in the opening couple of matches. Virgil van Djk who obviously signed a new contract last season. don't think he's been out of form particularly, but I think when you've got to then cover a lot of space when you're when you're into the the stage of the career that he is in, that also becomes a slight issue. And I just think Liverpool have been too open. I mean, that's they're conceding two goals per game. And if you're going to win the title, you just cannot do that. That has to stop. Um, and then Arsenal of course is the sort of other end of the scale, aren't they? and that how much control they have and how much they try to make sure that they're not open at the back and that they always have that cover there and that they're always I wouldn't say safety first, but they're certainly they're certainly set up in a way not to lose these games. And if you look at their record against the the big six as it were and I know it's a bit of an arbitrary measurement, but that goes they're undefeated uh in the last 22 matches back to April 2023. They've won 13 of those. So they're very very strong in these matches. Now that the other members of the big six have all won trophies in that period, but in some ways not losing is the biggest trophy of all, >> isn't it though? It's 13 years actually since Arsenal for all their record against the big clubs. Have actually won at Anfield. That was when Brendan Rogers was in charge on Murzy's side. This time they go in with some very exciting new arrivals. No uh Bukayo Saka. Not sure what the other injury news is, but could be seeing a gunner's debut forever. is >> I think the loss of Saka is important for this fixture because as Colin points out Kirkus has looked very uh unsure. I would have if I think if Sack had been fit then I would have thought Robertson would come in for this match. But I mean on the other side I thought Shersai was brilliant at right back at Newcastle on uh on Monday night. So that is a positive given the the other injuries Liverpool have. But yeah I mean as a the one thing Arsenal have struggled with is breaking down deep blocks. They're not really going to face one in this game. So they kind of don't need as much for this game. As is like your your lock pick for when they're facing a deep Brenford block at the Emirates really. But um given the injuries, I think he might play a role definitely. I mean obviously the other is young Rio against young Max. If either of them make it right >> is the lad who scored the hundth minute winner away at St. James's Park. >> Youngest score in Liverpool's history. only the fourth youngest scorer in Premier League history behind Rooney Milner and the youngest James Vaughn for Everton. Widest gap in age between a passer and goalcorer in Premier League history. It was Mo Salah >> ripled age of 33 teeing up 16-year-old Rio Angamoa. >> But which pairing >> Yeah. >> did those two supplant in the record books? Duncan can't answer because he probably wrote the tweet that I read got this information from. >> Was James Milner involved? It was not, but it was the same club. >> But which James Mono club? >> Sorry, the same club. Liverpool. >> All right. Okay. Do >> you want it now or should we leave it for the end of the show? >> Yeah. Leave it for the end of the show. >> Ironic that MSA got the assist. >> Because the the definitive act in the buildup to that goal was Dominic Sabosli's absolutely magnificent dummy. Does he get an assist for it? Does he get any does he get anything at all? Nothing. He just gets empty praise. >> How's he going to put that on his stats spreadsheet? You don't know if he he was about to shoot and then a bee went near him and he jumped like that and it went through. We we you know can't cover that. >> Oh, is that it? Excellent. All right. Well, I look forward to the answer to that stat question later on. Arsenal so dangerous from corners. The numbers say three of their six goals this season have been from corners taken by Declan Rice. In fact, he's taken three corners this season and they've scored from all of them. >> Incredible. >> Kind of doing with corners what he did with free kicks last season. >> Nice. He takes them, they go in. What a valuable asset to have. What do you think, Liverpool Arsenal? Is this huge? Is it massive for the title race? >> It's one of those like very exciting early season fixtures. >> Is this a day when you can't win the Premier League title, but you can lose. It's not. It's neither of those things. It's neither of those things. >> If you ask me, I think the fixture computer has gone too hard too early this season. Really, >> the first few weeks there's been an absolute big games. We are going to reach some point in October when it's going to be like quite bleak. >> Burnley Brenford again. >> I enjoy all the fixtures so it doesn't affect me but there are some out there who will be you know >> key part of this as well that rewind one year and Arsenal had all these really difficult away fixtures early on and a really strong record in them and winning one nil and 2-1 and oh this is this is the mark of champions and this this shows that they're that they're that they're that they've got what it takes this year and ultimately it was the other games they they sort of stumbled in. So would it really be a surprise if they put in a a sort of strong or controlled performance here and got at least a draw >> and then in a couple of weeks time maybe slipped up in a game that you might maybe expect them to win in. So yeah, I I don't think this game's going to be definitive in any way. But I think it's just going to be really interesting to to see the the clash styles and who's going to be able to adapt it that little bit better. Should be a lot of fun to watch. That's 4:30 on Sunday afternoon. The other games featuring the teams at the top of the table. Well, Chelsea are taking on Fulham Saturday lunch as we mentioned. Spurs are up against Bournemouth and Manchester City head to Brighton. Manchester City beaten of course by Spurs last weekend. Brighton were involved in the Carabai Cup second round. They went to the Kazam Stadium and uh beat Oxford. >> Struggling Oxford. Yeah, >> struggling Oxford 6-nil. They gave up quite a lot of chances though. Not sure what the xG was, but Jason Steel, who was back between the posts, right, had quite a busy I'm sure they don't care, but just in case any Oxford United fans are screaming at their >> right >> smart speakers. I thought I' thought I'd mention that. >> Duncan's not having it. I can tell by his face. >> Three stands, six girls. Do the ratio. >> Bruce Charlie observes that in view of Brighton's clash with Man City, Pep Guardiola is actually old enough to be Herzel's dad. He's there's 22 years of age difference. Tom, you'll enjoy that. Weird to think of Pep. I still think of him as being younger. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Maybe that's just me. Eh, >> one of the joys of premature balding, James, is that you you you age much less slowly. >> Is that Well, you No, >> that's an embarrassed pause. >> No, you you you age very quickly. >> You do your aging. >> You do get your aging out of the way. >> Get it out of the way. Lose your hair. Oh, no. My hair's gone bald. But then, oh, actually, >> welcome to my head as a reducer. >> Actually, all right. >> Literally reducer. But Pep Guardiola hasn't he doesn't Okay. His beard's getting grayer. >> Yeah. But in a stylish fashion this season, he dresses young. >> Dresses young. >> Dresses young. Anyway, uh the actual youngster, Fabian Hutz, >> younger than the Big Breakfast. >> He's yet to lose a game in oh two two clashes with Manchester City. and and in this game last year, City had the lead three times and then across the two games and obviously they didn't win either of the matches. >> And I do think that for Manchester City, there was a massive overreaction generally to that opening day game against Wolves. M I mean obviously they they won 4-0 and it's like you saw all the things that are good about them but that's exactly what we saw in the sort of last 10 12 games of last season against teams you sort of think they should beat and when they go out and they just look so good when they're afforded that time on the ball and they're not really threatened defensively but then the flip side of that was Tottenham last week and also when you kind of look back over the past sort of couple of games across a couple of tournaments stretching back at the earlier this year of course but the FA Cup final against Palace and how how they were so how they struggled to assert their authority in that obviously the club world cup as well they had that exit >> and they've had so many they've had so much change whereas if you look at Brighton Brighton who who we are all sort of accustomed to having this massive turnover of players they've only really got one new signing in their starting 11 from last season that's Maxim Dooper and the left back whereas City have all have made all these different changes obviously trying to to evolve a little bit and trying to refresh the squad but I think for this particular fixture you kind of think Brighton have all the quality to kind of exploit those weaknesses in City's team like the kind of weakness in transition and the front footedness. >> We'll see. I mean, this could be one of the most exciting fixtures of the of the weekend. >> Yeah, I mean, City's problems still boil down to the fact they don't have Rodri in their starting 11 and he's on the bench and, you know, maybe this is the game where where Pep ushers him into the I mean, for Brighton, they'll be I guess their fans be clamoring for Stephanos Zimas to come into the team. Obviously saw twice at Oxford. you know, not a high watermark, but it's um he's only 19. Obviously brought in this >> um well, he's on loan, wasn't he last year in the Bundesliga, but he um he looked really good. >> And Brighton's problem so far has been not scoring goals. The one nil up against Fulham on the opening day should have won conceded a stop time equalizer. I saw them at Everton last weekend and before >> Ilmani scores the first goal at the new stadium. Danny Wbeck has missed an absolute sittery as well. >> Also the penalty later on in the game. um kumu mitoma almost got an absolute worldy flick the ball over defender's head volley off the crossbar and this has been the kind of recurring feature and you know city do give up chances if they can kind of you know stick the ball in the net I don't want to press the sample size clon but every year >> allow a nations league once again the enigmatically titled poster who writes in to say to do that for you to finish my sentence uh he They write in to say is there a need for people to wind their collective neck in re the start that Thomas Frank has made at Spurs post the City win. Uh we've all been eulogizing Frank and I think just generally for the excellent start when they went two nothing against PSG. >> I feel like the collective neck has been >> wound wound out in general. I I sort of agree with the >> well let a Nations league once again pick up the story given that Spurs won eight of their first 10 Premier League games under an picked up an unprecedented three Premier League manager of the months awards in a row. I would say spoil sport to you a nation. >> I think that's more of an indictment of the manager of the month uh awarding system to be honest. I mean, >> right, >> I think that when with that start with an it was so unusual and I think the Premier League took 2 months to basically realize like they can't surely be playing this open and then eventually they did and then Spurs decline. So, but we should Yeah, we should point out that two game you wouldn't you wouldn't look at the Boxing Day fixtures and the one in in between New Year and go I'm going to base my whole judgment of a team on these two games. No, but when the start of the season, the map is undrawn and you fill in the blanks with your wildest imagination. Here be Dragons, there be a successful Tottenham team that win and go down. There's teams that lose the first and win the league. It's it's too early, you know. We can see maybe Manchester United aren't aren't going to win the league. We can maybe say that he's gone. He's not big. But uh with with Spurs, I just want to throw in the fact that there was the PSG game and I know that they didn't ultimately get the Super Cup, but it was >> although Nuno West Santo won all three of his first matches and won the manager of the month award and didn't get the chance to win anymore starting the season, >> which just it speaks to just the the impatience of the football fan. >> We want to know. We want to draw our conclusions as hastily as possible and just get rid of this terrible uncertainty. No, but that's why >> and then people get to February and they're like, "No, no, no. We're talking about it because you sit there, you watch a game for 90 minutes and you can't help but think, well, this means something and that team is going to be playing that team and look what they did." And, you know, that's the whole >> Oh, no. It's it's part of it's part of the joy of it. But I think the only thing you can say about Spurs is they've had a good start to the season. Thomas Frank has had a positive impact, but you know, they beat they had ideal opposition on the opening day, a promoted team, Burnley, who looked a little bit >> caught in the headlights. Um and then they won at way city which is what they always do and they played well in the in the Super Cup and Frank is obviously getting his ideas across and you know cudas has started well over Charison's filling in very well for um for Dominic Salanki and Brenard Johnson's in the goals etc etc. It's too early to it's too early to say. >> Well this might be where it all comes unstuck as they welcome Bournemouth uh to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Curious if Frank's Old played Bournemouth midweek. Brenford uh they're in the Carabai Cup. It was actually Brenford who won two nil. Bournemouth who said goodbye to a wealth of players over the summer. It's going to be an interesting one. I guess we can draw further conclusions but a long way from concrete ones after that games played the other game wanted to mention here. Chelsea who last Friday who equally last weekend impressed smash out poor West Ham on Friday 51 and then this week followed that up by getting Liam Dilap to do live cubic roots first of all for anyone who didn't see this what what is sorry a cubic square root what is a cubic square root Duncan >> some I mean his dad did long throws he does long division that's all I can boil it down to >> I mean it's a bit beyond that though isn't it they're shouting out 374,953 And he's thinking, is that the wage difference percentage between Man United and Groomsby Town? But it actually doesn't. It just comes out immediately with the cubic square root. >> Multiple numbers. >> They ask him how. And every time they say correct, he goes, he nods like, "Yeah, I know." >> And at the end, black and white. >> At the end, he's asked, "Oh, what? How did you do that? How'd you do that?" And he just goes, "Clever, isn't it?" And fair enough. >> It is, but that's clever in that very specific way. >> Is it as good as Sunderland's Luke O'Ne um juggling the ball while doing a Rubik's cube? I think that's better. >> I mean, they're both impressive. >> I'm just fascinated by what leads a mind. How does a mind pass those numbers? Because it's obviously it's clear to clear as day. He doesn't have to do calculations. It's just you can just draw a line through that number and that's the answer. >> Guess your dad's outside endlessly practicing his long throws. You've got to fill those afternoons somehow. >> He had to fold a lot of towels as a youngster. So, you got to think of something. >> I His dad must have had an innate understanding of parabola. I would suggest so maybe there is >> mistake. >> It's in Tony Person's short foreign signing phase and Tonshai. >> Right. Okay. Anyway, if you haven't seen the clip or if you have and you just want to be impressed again. Seek it out. It's on Chelsea's social media account and it is amazing. Oh, on the subject of Chelsea against Fulham, uh, prepare the steak and get the kindling ready because we've got a heretic writing in. CG says, "Are Chelsea better without Palmer?" Is CG saying what everyone's thinking? >> No. >> No. We don't know if Cole Palmer is going to be fit for this one. It may not matter because they've got Xiao Pedro who's got four goals in four games. Lim Deap's clever. So is Marco Silva who has gone to his bench in both of Fulham's games so far and found a goalc scoring substitute. Uh oh, by the way, Fulham won this fixture last season. That was their first win at Stanford Bridge in 45 years. I mean, there are many other things we could say about this game, but perhaps let's wait for it to happen and then draw conclusions. It's Thursday, listen, as we record this, and later on today, they're going to do the draw for the Champions League phase uh with seven new teams >> entering the mix courtesy of the Champions League playoffs, which they had the second legs of Tuesday, Wednesday. In amongst the PSGs, the Man cities, Liverpool's ins and Barcelonas, we're going to have the northernmost team in Champions League history. Well, Bodo stroke glimpmed. They put up storm grats. And also the easternmost team in Champions League history, Karat Al- Mati, who knocked out Celtic on penalties after two goalless draws. Listener Steven Taylor points out that Karat Al Mati are closer to Tokyo than Newcastle, who will undoubtedly draw them. We shall see. There is a there's a look on the Wikipedia page for the season's Champions League and there is a map showing where all the teams are and Kirat is so eastern most that on the map it just says Kaiat and it's pointing off the map and then it says in brackets not on map >> closed brackets. >> Well, they're on the map now after those >> Oh, they put themselves on the map. >> Yeah. and Poss FC of Cyprus who also booked their place midweek. Not featuring in the Champions League group stage or league phase rather will be Jose Mour Mourinho and his Fernabash side who got beaten by his old club Benfica and there are no Scottish teams whatsoever after Celtics draw and exit with Al Mati Kyra Al Mati and also the very next day after Rangers went to Bruge looking to turn around a 3-1 first leg defeat and didn't quite do it >> narrow 6-nil uh reverse >> right 6 nil. >> Wouldn't it be fun if Rangers and Celtic played each other this weekend? >> Well, Duncan, you're in luck. >> Oh, what? >> It is It is the old firm game this weekend. They did have a player sent off after 8 minutes, but the way that their team collapsed and eventually uh went out 9-1 on aggregate, which I believe is the third worst aggregate defeat in Champions League history, has set alarm bells. The alarm bells that weren't already ringing, they're ringing now because Russell Martins had 10 games in charge, won only three of them and well, if it doesn't go well for him in the old firm game this weekend, one wonders, new owners, new manager, so you never know. >> Yeah, it's obviously been a really really difficult week for Scottish football in in Europe. And I think I actually think what you're talking about all the new teams that are in the Champions League um league phase and I think that kind of shows that there is a a triumph of how UFA have have kind of not manufactured to draw but you you have in in these in these tournaments you have like a champions path and then a path for the rest of us. That's why you get teams like Benfica and Fenbache. >> So it's almost like a nation's league for clubs. >> I think it gives it gives an opportunity for nations like Kazakhstan, like Cyprus, like Norway the opportunity to to to reach those stages of competition. I mean, Kairad aren't the first Kazakhstani club. It was Astana who've been the flagship team. They were in the group stages 10 years ago. And I think one of the one of the things is is for teams like that when Aana were in the Champions group phase. They didn't lose any of their three home matches. I mean, those are really really difficult away matches to go to for for any team. >> It's really cold there as well. >> Very cold. Um very long journey. um hostile atmosphere and the match the match against Celtic actually ended uh at local time on Wednesday morning. So that I mean that must have an impact on you as a player after all that traveling and the sort of time zone differences and trying to acclimatize yourself I guess to that environment. But yeah, I think it's a it's a really it's a really interesting format the way the way things have panned out this year. You're talking about obviously Bodl Glimp being the most northern club in the Champions League, Car being the most eastern. >> It's really cold there as well. >> Yes. Yes, I would imagine. So, I've never been quite that far north into the the Arctic Circle, but yeah, it is it's extraordinary. And the western most club in Europe, uh, Santa Clara from the Azores Islands of Portugal have a chance to get into the Conference League group phases. Um, >> they are, I mean, we were recording this early on Thursday, they're they're two-1 down to Shamrock Rovers of the League of Ireland, >> but again, it's um, geographically, it's a very pleasing uh, draw >> like Lor's Angle Seeds Clethorps journey. We're really maxing out the old >> latitude and longitude of football. >> We're getting plenty of mileage from it. Kahir asks, "Are there any major coefficient repercussions for Scottish clubs in football?" Oo. Is this one of those situations where because they have a better chance of going far deep in the Europa League that could actually work out better or not? >> I think it could potentially. And I think one of the things is Celtic have been really underperforming in Europe for the best part of the few decades. I made the point last season they haven't won a uh they haven't progressed through a knockout round um past the league phase or group phase since 2004 in any European competition. So that's going into the 22nd year of that which is remarkable when you look at Rangers who've actually done quite well in Europe. Obviously have reached the Europa League final. They tend to go quite deep into that competition regularly but domestically Rangers have obviously struggled in comparison. So I think there is an issue there and obviously you've got Aberdine um are still playing in Europe. Hibernian as well going into the Conference League. um playoff games. But yeah, Scott, I think Scottish football in general has an issue because you look at a lot of teams that they're going up against, especially Rangers and Celtic teams who've got comparable budgets. I mean, Club Res budget is similar to Rangers, but they're beating them 9-1 in aggregate. And obviously, there's maybe a coaching factor in there, too, as Rangers fans will point out. But yeah, it's it's not great. And I think Scottish football tends to compare itself to England quite a lot, which is kind of unhelpful because I mean, England's a complete one-off in terms of the the income that it's got for its clubs, but Scott Scottish football needs to have some sort of fundamental issues addressed. >> I mean, if you look at the current uh UEFA rank coefficient rankings, which obviously are subject to change a lot as we go into the season, but Scotland now after this week's results have gone below Cyprus. I mean they should pull that back because um they still got four teams left in Europe and club's got three and yeah as we said one of them is in the Champions League but they are 18th and quite a long way to Collins Point behind England. Right now though let's get back to the Premier League and more Crisis club news. West Ham West Ham followed up last weekend's 5-1 defeat to Chelsea by losing 3-2 away at previously windless Wolves. They were two and up in this game before two goals in three minutes from Jorgen Strand Larsson. Strand Larson who's very much the subject of transfer interest from Newcastle. Uh coming off the bench and in the last 10 minutes with that brace to to get Molyneux rocking. Worryingly for West Ham, Victor Pereira had fielded a much change wolves side, but I think I'm right in saying that Graeme Potter had gone with a strong hammer 11 with certainly Bowen and Pakitar right from the start. >> Few changes, but >> few changes. >> Yeah. >> All right. >> Not wholesale changes. >> Jared with Jared Bone. >> Jared Bone. Yeah. Jared Bone. >> Quite lowkey beef, >> right? Describe it. >> The headlines made it look made it sound worse than actually was. Did he offer a fan? >> There's no cancer. He did not appear to offer a fan outside for >> Did he appear to climb to wish to climb over the advertising hoarding to confront? >> Not not necessarily. So basically the West Ham fans trapes over to sorry the West Ham players trapes over to the away fans at the end of the game and Bowen sort of is the closest to the away supporters who thinned out quite considerably. Um, and I think one of them is giving him a bit of a bit of stick >> and and Bowen kind of remmonstrates and looks like he wants to, you know, get involved in a in a more profound conversation and he's pulled away by his teammates and that was it. And he apologized very quickly on social media. You know, >> everyone's hurting. >> Everyone's hurting. >> Everyone's hurting and you can certainly What are West Ham doing this weekend? They're going to Nottingham Forest. Wolves will be up against Everton who also they're going to be facing in the third round of the Carabai Cup after knocking West Ham out uh this week. So yeah, West Ham against Nottingham Forest, but it's no disgrace to lose away to another Premier League side 3-2, but against the backdrop of Graham Potter's other results, the start of the season and the fact that he's now been in charge for 20 Premier League matches and has won only five of them. Uh, is the clock a ticking there as well? >> West Ham's issues definitely go much deeper than than Graham Potter. Um, but I think that was obvious when he walked through the door there last season that you kind of think is this is this going to be the right club for him? Is is West Ham the right club for any manager aside from maybe David Moyes over the past sort of five or 10 years, you know, when whenever July um sort of sacked several months into the season, oh, you know, look look how much of a disaster was and but you you kind of look at his track record even even at Wolves and he he's actually done quite a good job there. You can see he's trying to implement the style. He's got his own ideas. You didn't see any of that at West Ham. And it's exactly the same. It's exactly the same with Graham Potter. You just don't see any style of play. And looking at West Ham starting 11, only two of their outfield players are younger than 28. And this seems to be a sort of recurring theme of their recruitment that it just seems so scattergun. It seems to be like, oh, let's let's bring in Callum Wilson who's sort of into his early 30s, has had pretty bad injury problems past couple of years, and that's on top of Nicholas Fulcr who they signed last season, who's into his early 30s and has had injury problems the past season. and you sort of just think what is it they're trying to do? What's the overall aim? And they're going into this game against Forest who've obviously made a decent start to the season, but who've obviously got massive question marks over over the future of their own manager for very different reasons. >> Right. Well, yeah, issues indeed. Chris Wood is not under 28, but he is still scoring lots of goals. And bad news for West Ham, they're his favorite opponent. He's got eight goals against them so far. As you mentioned, Forest do have issues of their own. They have not lost a game. and they've not dropped points against the Hammers since Nuno took charge of the club. But there was some doubt last weekend whether he would still be in charge of the club come this fixture that has it all gone quiet on that is has peace broken out at the city ground. >> Well, it feels like it's gone quiet and there hasn't been any news out of the last few days as we record. But then the most explosive provider of news uh with regard to this saga over the last couple of weeks has been Nuno Spirit of Santo himself. I think it will be his pre-match press conference that gives the clearest indication as to where things are. you know whether things have settled down and even prior to the very explosive press conference that preceded the uh Crystal Palace game prior to the opening game against Brenford. He gave a very downbeat, very pessimistic press conference about how unprepared the team was for the season and seemed determined to strike a pretty miserable note and then Forest go and put three past Brenford and you know play pretty well. So yeah, I think I suspect that will I I was going to say that that will be the most keenly anticipated pre-match press conference. We've also got Ruben Amarims to come so perhaps not. West Ham the visitors to Nottingham Forest Wolves who beat them midweek hosting Everton. Wolves are the only team who got no points and no goals in the Premier League this season, but they have got Jorgen Strand Len. Will they be keeping hold of him? We don't know. They have rejected a5 million pound bid from Newcastle this week. Everton, meanwhile, have they now tied up the services of the young and exciting Tyler Dibbling? >> They have. He made his debut last night as a substitute. Um, no, he didn't. He did. Yeah. Yeah. As a replacement for Jack Greish in the two-nil win over Mansfield. >> What we're all hoping is it'll be Greish on one flank and Dibbling doing the dribbling >> and NDI in the middle. I mean, dribblers galore, dribblers delight. >> It should be pointed out that people sort of, you know, think David Moyes is quite a da manager, but he does he does enjoy a sort of dribbly front unit and now he's got one >> and a cross >> and a header. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. All right. Wolves Everton, that's Saturday 3:00. Don't try and watch it unless you're outside the UK or you're at Molyneu. >> Yep. Those are your options. So, prepare yourself. >> Yeah. 28th of August as we record. listener. 20th of August is a bad day historically for Arsenal fans. On this day, for example, 28th of August 1994, young Robbie Fowler scored what was at that time the fastest hattrick in Premier League history against Arsenal at Anfield. Took him four and a half minutes. uh on this day in 2011 it was the Man United 82 >> the birth of very very much the birth of kind of social media football memeology I'd say to be an Arsenal fan >> etc etc also made people think about Lubra's football team more than any other day in football history >> because >> because it was Arsenal's biggest defeat since they lost to back in the day >> Arsenal was so spooked boot by that 8-2 defeat that they signed in a deadline day splurge. Mikuel Lattetto who's now their manager and P Motors who's now head of their academy, an academy that's furnishing them with a flurry, a falank of uh young football talent. Lovely. >> Didn't they all Wasn't that also the window when they signed a bunch of other really random players? Was it Ben Yun as well? >> That one. And it was generally seen as this very unsuccessful panicky late transfer window >> era where where didn't really sign many players. So Arsenal fans too young from Monaco as well. I think >> they were so eager for any signings and we must remember this was the peak of transfer deadline day when you know in its in its pomp dildo in ear. >> Yeah. Fans would gather behind reporters up and down the country. >> What killed that? Was it co >> um the dildo? security measures for journalists mainly. >> All right. Uh Premier League weekend. Also coming up, we've got Sunderland against Brenford Leadeds hosting Newcastle. And late late Sunday, Villa against Crystal Palace, which has been moved as mentioned because Palace have suddenly found themselves caught up in the Europa Conference League. Now Palace in that competition are in action this Thursday night. They are 1 nil up against Frederick Strat from the first leg, but they're away in Norway, so we'll see what happens. A narrow lead, but they are on a 12 match unbeaten run in all competitions. Uh Oliver Glasner earning plaudits for his progress so far with a probably pretty under strength Palace. What's up with the Villa though? I know they haven't made many signings either. You got your Evan Gason. Is it Gason? >> Evan Gason. >> Yes. Weep. we will it be a guess on game this I don't know but what is up with with with Villa >> well they haven't really signed any players they've lost a lot of the important loan that came in in the second half of last season gave them a bit of a boost um and they've just looked really flat I mean that first game against Newcastle uh at Villa Park that was the game in which I think in April Villa just completely took Newcastle to the cleaners beat them 4-1 I think and Newcastle just got into them and they never got going. Um, and then similarly Toothless in the defeat at Brenford last weekend and the only players they've signed are Evangelon who hasn't started a game yet in the league and Marco Bizot the the backup goalkeeper. I mean, you can't put it all down to, you know, transfers, but I think I mean, it doesn't help with with the mood, but I think the fact that, you know, you you had this new dynamic in the second half of last season that with, you know, uh, Marco Asencio and and Rashford notably leaving has now disappeared and they've not they've not managed to find a new dynamic and, you know, Ollie Watkins has has looked a little bit off it. Morgan Rogers ditto. Um, Bubakar Camera's now injured. Uh so yeah, I think a combination of factors as is so often the case. >> One of the issues with with Villa is that on the opening day of the season and and for the second game too, seven of the 10 outfield players they had were there when Steven Gerard was was manager at the club. Now that's obviously going back quite a while and I think that goes to show quite a few things. But I think there's a general I don't know I don't know if it's a consensus amongst football fans. People see villains, oh that's like a really well-run club who make really savvy signings. But when you look back over the last several windows under Monty, the sporting director, a lot a lot of the signings just haven't worked out at all. A lot of the signings haven't come anywhere near to being the in the first team. You kind of think is are those those players that Emory wanted? Are those players that the club wanted? Obviously, Villa have had all these sort of PSR issues in the past couple of years. It's like they're trying to make all these tradeoffs to to tick sort of financial boxes. obviously sold Jacob Ramsey uh last week to Newcastle and that's another player you think oh he he's sort of fits into their model very well but all of a sudden he's gone is he going to be replaced >> yeah and Evan Cassand has come in but he was he was sort of I think a target for Crystal Palace this summer and they had sort of evaluated the possibility of signing him and then they kind of thought better of it because of the sort of finances financial package and they kind of thought this relatively small sample size um from his time at Nice last season >> I think when you excited about him? No, >> I really like him. He's quite a curious player in that he started off last season at Nice playing through the middle and then ended up playing more off the right, but he's a right-footed player who plays on the right, which makes him quite unusual, but a very inventive player. And I think when he came on at Brenford, he made a real difference. >> He keeps guessing. >> He what? >> He keeps on guessing. >> He keeps him guessing. Sorry. Yes. >> Yeah. Yes, he Well, he does. He does. >> I'm just sat here thinking his name. >> Just firing him out here. Just firing him out. But yeah, he's the kind very much the kind of player who will keep his opponents. Yeah, you can't pronounce it. Yeah, that pun doesn't work in the French accent. So I just Yeah, I'll guess >> I'll abandon that sentence. >> Villa Palace, the Harry and Megan Classico, Sunland Brenford, Black Cat Bees. First topfly meeting between these clubs since May 1947. Woof. 40 vibes this week with Man United and and Grimby's reunion and and now this one. >> Shout out to Sunderland's Ellesia Mayenda who's played so far three 139 minutes in the Premier League out of a potential 180. He's made only three passes completing two of them. This is both the fewest passes and fewest successful passes in a player's first two Premier League starts since OPA started recording these things in 2003. What position does he play? >> Center forward. >> So he just never gets the ball essentially. >> Yeah. Your move, Erling Holland. >> Wow. It's almost 140 minutes and he's he's made three passes. >> Don't need to pass the ball if you're busy sticking it in the net. >> That's probably what he thinks. >> Just, you know, cause a few problems for the defenders. >> Sunland were knocked out of the Carab Cup by League One Huddersfield on penalties by Leo Casteline. Was it both scorers in this game were Chelsea loies in just like the latest indication of Chelsea's tentacular spread over the whole of football. Right. >> But Leo Casteline who scored the Huddersfield goal. Absolute beauty. >> 90s Premier League icon Stuart Casteline. >> Is he really? >> Mhm. >> There you go. So between them the Castle family and Chelsea Football Club have basically got control of of English football. >> Wow. It's in safe hands. What was the goal? What What was so special about the goal, Tom? I >> think it was a cross came in from the right, cleared to the edge of the area, and Castleanine kind of runs onto it. He's kind of in the sort of inside right like half space. He just hits it, laces on the volley, top right corner, billowing net. >> Love it. >> Home fans silenced. >> Same picture. >> Magnificent. >> Sunderland Brenford could be a very set piece match, couldn't it? Obviously Keith Andrews, the former set piece coach in Sunderland who put such an emphasis on scoring from from set pieces too. And I think this this round of fixtures is actually I think it's a really good round of fixtures in the sense of really good matchups like really interesting storylines. Sunderland and Brenford probably two really strong examples of how the kind of narratives flip so quickly in the early weeks of the season after the first match day and Sunderland got that massive win over West Ham and all this positivity and then they go and slump >> one side versus two games >> whereas Brenford and all the sort of doubts of is Keith Andrews actually a manager to begin with and then that really poor forest performance and then they go and beat Aston Villa 1 nil and then the league league cup win >> and you sort of think all of a sudden there's it's completely changed and and you're still in August. So, yeah, this game will be really interesting and um I do think that stylistically it might not be one for the purists, but uh yeah, it or it might be one for the purist >> or it might not be. >> I think whoever wins this game stays up. >> It's a big shout from Duncan. >> Not the first one he's made, nor I suspect the last. The other game taking place this weekend is leads Newcastle. uh leads against a depleted Newcastle because Tonali, Joelington, and Sha are all out injured and Anthony Gordon is now suspended post Monday night's defeat to Liverpool. >> Yeah. Cough rake. >> Calf raking. >> Red card. Yeah. >> If we're talking about depleted teams, they don't come much more depleted than Sheffield Wednesday at the moment. um who essentially played what was a sort of youth team almost against against leads midweek >> uh and leadeds were relatively strong and brought on a lot of their big guns in the second half couldn't get it done and lost on penalties and I I actually saw the the sort of closing stages of this game and Daniel um sorry Dominic Cal Leuen um had a series of really point blank misses and then he skyed his penalty in in the shootout >> and again it goes to sort of show that, you know, leads his early kind of positivity around that Everton game and then you go and lose 5-nil at Arsenal. Okay, it's it's away at Arsenal and then that that match mid week. So again, this this feels almost like a big match for them that if this doesn't go well and you sort of think >> all of a sudden there might be question marks over Daniel Farer the guy that's going to that can keep them up and and have they had a good window or not. So yeah, it's all early conclusions, isn't it? But these these games are all really good markers for it. >> I mean Cavaloon had an xG of 1.4 four in that game and Sheffield Wednesday had an xG of 0.15. So, and he >> plus the squandered shootout penalty. >> Yeah. And he had to come out. It's if if early into your career, you have to come out on social media and almost apologize for performance. It's >> not great. Mark Kerry was suggesting on Sunday that XG >> is a misleading statistic when applied to a single game, but only really comes to it into its own when applied over a bigger sample. >> That is true. >> Okay. But Duncan's drunk on the power of it. That's why he knows he he knows he shouldn't. But >> it's like when they built the Death Star. You shouldn't use it for certain things, but if you got it, they've got that just there. You know, >> it's hard not to, isn't it? >> Order on. >> I would say that's it for today's show, our preview of the Premier League weekend and much more. But there's still one uh matter still outstanding. Tom Williams, just remind us first of all what the question was. So, in Liverpool's 3-2 win at Newcastle on Monday, uh a new record was set for the largest gap in age between an assist provider and goal scorer. >> Uh when 33-year-old Mo Salah set up 16-year-old Rio and Gamoha for the winner and my question was >> whose record did they beat? And it was set by two former Liverpool players, >> right? >> And the answer is >> Oh, does anybody know Colin Duncan producer Charlie? >> No, no, Charlie's not allowed. No, Charlie is allowed. Come on. Here comes Bruce and Charlie. >> Guess John Barnes and Michael Owen >> is incorrect. >> I mean, I know the answer. >> So, that's why you're not allowed to answer. >> Why do you know the answer? >> Cuz cuz of someone I know who came up with the very good statistic that Tom Williams has stolen for his own. >> All right. Who's Should we credit the person who who came? >> Yeah. This is um Michael Reed, who is a Opton, a Liverpool specialist. Right. If you want if you like Liverpool if you like Liverpool data and stats, then you should follow him on uh on social media. >> All right. And his shiny laptop. >> The correct answer is of course Gary Mallister and a young Steven Gerard >> in the early naughties at some point. >> Thank you for that, Tom. And so much more. And thank you as well to Colin Miller and Duncan Alexander, to Lloyd Griffith and Lorie Whitwwell, too. Also to Jake and producer Charlie in the booth and you listener, we will have a totally extra for you on Saturday. Again, this is our kind of weekend special show where we just chat about some stuff. Duncan, we recorded this earlier in the week. yourself, myself, Junior Luron and Michael Cox who in between getting a dining table delivered, >> helped us with a bit of a deep dive into the enigmatic career of Nicola Anelka. Was he Lulk as so many posited? Is he simply misunderstood as his own Netflix special suggests? Suggests very strongly in fact. Why not join us to see our conclusions and some dining room table delivery banter uh that's in totally extra and then of course on Sunday night late late Sunday night. Thanks Premier League fixtures.
