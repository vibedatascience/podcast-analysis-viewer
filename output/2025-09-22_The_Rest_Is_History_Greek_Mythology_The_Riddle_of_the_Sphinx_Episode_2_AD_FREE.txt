What is the story behind the writing of Oedipus, the notorious king of Thebes who murdered his father and unwittingly married his mother? Was it based on a real historical event? What are Oedipus’ cursed mythic origins in Thebes? Who was Sophocles, the legendary Greek playwright? Why was the play a product of 5th century Athens; its rivalries with other greek city states such as Thebes, a raging plague, and the tyrant Pericles? What horrifying events unfold in Oedipus? It is the greatest tragedy of all time? And, how did it later come to influence Sigmund Freud’s unnerving interpretation of the deepest desires of the subconscious….?

Join Tom and Dominic as they discuss one of the most famous Greek myths of all time: Oedipus; unravelling this disturbing tragedy, delving into its meaning today, and exploring the historical context behind it all.
