**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Historical Shift in US-Pakistan Relations

***"Pakistan and the United States have had this relationship that going back decades has had very high highs and low lows that you can't even imagine"***

The US-Pakistan relationship reached its lowest point after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, when Pakistan faced sanctions despite helping defeat the Soviet Union. The relationship deteriorated further due to **American frustration over Pakistan's alleged double game in Afghanistan**, with accusations that the Haqqani Network operated as a "veritable arm of the ISI," contributing to US soldier deaths. Pakistan's reputation as a "problem child" extended beyond terrorism to economic instability, nuclear proliferation, and missile development programs.

Simultaneously, the United States made a **long-term strategic bet on India as a counterbalance to China**. Building trust with India, which harbored historical mistrust from Cold War-era US-Pakistan cooperation, became easier by demonstrating a reassessment of Pakistan ties. This approach proved effective for years, with Washington growing frustrated with Pakistan's unchanging political landscape - Zardari remains president, Nawaz Sharif maintains relevance, and while army chiefs rotate, the military's ideology persists unchanged.

## 2. America's Geopolitical Reassessment Driving Pakistan Engagement

***"The United States in West Asia has three core objectives: keep an eye on Iran and its influence, find a pathway in the Middle East to create a new security architecture, and keep terror groups in check in Afghanistan and Central Asia"***

The Trump administration's engagement with Pakistan stems from broader geopolitical calculations rather than personality-driven decisions. **Pakistan proves crucial across all three US objectives in West Asia**. The administration prioritizes bringing perpetrators of the Abbey Gate bombing to justice - an attack in Kabul during the US withdrawal that killed multiple soldiers. Pakistan delivered on this priority, building trust with the new administration, contrasting sharply with their missile tests during Biden's inauguration.

Pakistan's **strategic importance extends to counterterrorism cooperation**, demonstrated in foiling the ISIS-Khorasan inspired attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Austria. The country's extensive land border with Iran provides leverage for squeezing Iranian diesel smuggling operations that fund terrorism and facilitate illicit weapons flows. In the evolving Middle Eastern security architecture, while Pakistan won't join Abraham Accords 2.0 soon, it plays a crucial role as a **trusted adviser to both Turkey and Saudi Arabia**. Syrian intelligence delegations have already visited Pakistan to rekindle ties, leveraging Pakistan's historical role in training air forces across Syria, Jordan, and Iraq.

## 3. Critical Minerals and Chinese Containment Strategy

***"In Reko Diq mine, it's one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold mines left on earth"***

The Reko Diq mine represents a **pivotal test case for US-Pakistan cooperation on critical minerals**. After years of international arbitration, Barrick Gold, a Canadian company, resumed operations under the previous army chief and Imran Khan's settlement. American policymakers fear Chinese takeover of this asset, which could lead to infrastructure development linking to Gwadar port and eventual Chinese naval presence - a scenario both Washington and Islamabad claim to oppose.

Pakistan has signaled openness to Western investment through **Ambassador Blume's unprecedented speech in Gwadar**, emphasizing commercial opportunities for all nations. The International Finance Corporation and World Bank announced financing packages, while Barrick secured a $400 million contract for mining equipment from Komatsu, with **three of four production factories located in Republican-controlled American states**, opening potential DFC financing opportunities. The Asian Development Bank shows interest in logistics infrastructure, and Barrick's CEO confirmed pursuit of a **G7 financing package**, demonstrating Pakistan's commitment to Western partnership over Chinese monopolization.

## 4. Operation Sindur and Military Capability Reassessment

***"When the Pakistanis were able to stall that Indian attack on that first night and claim multiple jets - 6 as the Pakistanis often refer - that meant this near-bankrupt country still has the wherewithal and technological capabilities"***

Operation Sindur fundamentally altered Washington's assessment of South Asian military dynamics. **Establishing air dominance represents the quintessential sign of major power capability**, as demonstrated in conflicts from Azerbaijan-Armenia to Israel-Iran. Pakistan's ability to stall India's initial attack, with Western sources reporting two to three or more Indian jet losses, proved that despite economic dysfunction and political chaos, Pakistan maintains effective combat capabilities including doctrine and human resources beyond mere equipment.

The conflict triggered a **reassessment of India's capacity as a net security provider** in the Indo-Pacific. If India remains bogged down in the Himalayas - whether on the Line of Control with Pakistan or Line of Actual Control with China - it cannot invest adequately in maritime capabilities essential for the US vision. The United States must now invest substantially more than anticipated in Indian capabilities to achieve desired regional security outcomes. This realization drives American encouragement for India-Pakistan normalization, as Secretary Rubio's tweets indicate, creating friction in US-India relations but reflecting Washington's interest in freeing India from continental entanglements.

## 5. China-Pakistan Military Collaboration During Conflict

***"Yes it's Chinese equipment and technology - the PL-15s, the domestic variant not the export one - but the pilots were Pakistani, the interconnectivity of systems was Pakistani"***

India's Chief of Defense Staff claimed India fought two adversaries simultaneously during the conflict - Pakistan and China - citing intelligence sharing and GPS tracking collaboration. Pakistan maintains that while they operate Chinese Beidou systems providing GPS tracking and satellite imagery, **the software investments, sensor integration, doctrine development, and pilot training represent indigenous Pakistani capabilities**.

The conflict served as a **coming-out party for Chinese aircraft and missiles**, but human resources and systems integration remained Pakistani. Post-conflict developments support this assessment: the Pakistan Air Force chief's first trip was to the United States, Turkey began sending cadets to Pakistani air force academies, and Middle Eastern nations discuss defensive air maneuvers with Pakistan. These developments suggest recognition of Pakistani tactical capabilities beyond mere Chinese equipment operation.

## 6. Pakistan's Engagement Willingness and Normalization Obstacles

***"When Galwan was heating up and the Chinese and Indians were exchanging blows, the Pakistanis gave India a ceasefire at the Line of Control - that ceasefire still holds to this day"***

Pakistan's military establishment, including former army chief General Bajwa who expressed regret about not exploring openings with India, demonstrates genuine interest in normalization. During the Galwan crisis, **Pakistan offered a ceasefire to avoid exploiting India's two-front vulnerability**, interpreting subsequent proxy activities in Balochistan and assassination campaigns against Lashkar-e-Taiba members as Indian exploitation of perceived weakness.

The **Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan**, targeting families of soldiers weeks before Pulwama, exemplifies Pakistan's narrative of reciprocal proxy warfare. Pakistan attributes this to the Balochistan Liberation Army, which they claim operates as an Indian proxy. Both nations remain locked in a dynamic where Pakistan insists on discussing all issues including terrorism (encompassing Balochistan and Pakhtunkhwa), trade, confidence-building measures, and Kashmir, while India maintains preconditions that Pakistan views as non-starters.

## 7. US Mediation in India-Pakistan Relations

***"The United States has to now start looking inwards to its domestic needs and the needs of the western hemisphere and therefore cannot continue to be drawn into conflicts that suck its energy out"***

The Trump administration's worldview encompasses building a **post-neoliberal global order**, evidenced by mediation efforts between Azerbaijan-Armenia, pursuit of Abraham Accords 2.0, and eventual Russia-Ukraine negotiations. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, with their periodic skirmishes threatening nuclear escalation, represent an unacceptable drain on American resources when the US needs both countries addressing specific regional security requirements.

The administration seeks not Kashmir resolution but **establishment of new rules of engagement enabling dialogue**. This approach allows each nation to focus on American priorities while unlocking development potential in Indian Punjab, Pakistani Punjab, the Kashmirs, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar - regions that cannot progress under current tensions. India cannot effectively access Central Asian markets, while Pakistan faces trade and energy integration challenges. **Only integration of India's Hindi heartland with Pakistan's central and northern provinces can unlock regional development potential**.

## 8. General Munir's Washington Visit and Strategic Messaging

***"The most interesting thing I heard post-visit was that they would always say he didn't have an ask - the Pakistanis always have asks"***

General Munir's June White House visit marked a **strategic shift in Pakistani diplomatic approach** - presenting partnership rather than requests. Pakistan's core messages focused on counterterrorism cooperation as a shared threat, with General Kurilla of CENTCOM (who received a Pakistani medal before retirement) playing a key role. Pakistan emphasized economic investment opportunities in critical minerals and technology sectors, seeking integration with American ecosystems.

Most significantly, Pakistan requested **de-hyphenation from India** - examining US-Pakistan relations bilaterally rather than through New Delhi's prism. Pakistan accepts India's strategic importance to American interests while seeking treatment as a bilateral partner evaluated on its own merits. The visit coincided with strikes on Iran, with Pakistan clearly opposing Iranian nuclear weapons development and viewing Iran as a **revisionist power creating regional challenges**. Pakistan signaled alignment with Gulf countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, in pursuing Middle Eastern peace, leveraging historical security partnerships including treaties with Saudi Arabia and longstanding cooperation with Iraq, Syria, and Jordan.

## 9. Regional Implications of US South Asia Policy

***"All of the smaller powers including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal have a position that they want to guard against Indian regional hegemony"***

An India-centric US policy risks pushing smaller South Asian nations toward China as a counterbalance to perceived Indian hegemony. When the United States subordinates its interests to Indian preferences regionally, **smaller powers seek alternative partnerships**, and China offers compelling tools including capital, technology, electric vehicles, solar panels, and financing.

The pathway forward requires American engagement with all regional countries on their individual merits while encouraging India-Pakistan dialogue. Without normalization, **proxy activities in Balochistan threaten American geoeconomic and security interests**, while Kashmir tensions prevent India from focusing on maritime priorities. Continued regional fragmentation keeps South Asia poor, disconnected, and vulnerable to climate disasters, perpetually requiring American crisis intervention. The United States must bet on both Islamabad and New Delhi, recognizing that this shift represents a permanent feature of the emerging world order rather than a temporary Trump administration quirk.
