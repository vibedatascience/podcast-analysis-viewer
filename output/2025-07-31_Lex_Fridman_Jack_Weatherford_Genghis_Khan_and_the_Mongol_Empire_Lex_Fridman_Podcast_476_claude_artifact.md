**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Origins: Kidnapping and Childhood Trauma

***"The story of Genghis Khan, like the story of all of us, it doesn't begin at birth. The story begins long before birth, and sometimes it can be many generations before."***

The foundation of Genghis Khan's life story begins with an act of violence that would reverberate through generations. His father Yesugei, while hunting with his falcon, spotted a young bride named Hoelun traveling with her husband across Mongol territory. Women drove carts in Mongol society, as they owned the houses (gers) and household equipment. Yesugei gathered his two brothers and pursued the couple. When the husband realized he was being chased, he attempted to lead the pursuers away, but Hoelun made a calculated decision. She told her husband to flee and save his own life, urging him to find another wife and name her Hoelun in her memory. As one of the brothers told her when she began screaming after her husband disappeared over the ridge: it didn't matter if she shook the waters out of the river or shook the mountains with her screaming - she would never see that man again.

This kidnapping created an unusual family structure. Yesugei already had a wife named Sochigel with one son, and later another. Hoelun became essentially a second, non-legal wife. When Temujin was born, his father wasn't even present - he was off fighting the Tatars. During this campaign, Yesugei killed a man named Temujin Uge, meaning "Person of Iron" in Turkic. Upon returning to find he had a new son, he named the child after the man he had just killed. This was hardly an auspicious beginning for someone who would become the greatest conqueror in history.

The childhood that followed was marked by repeated abandonment and struggle. When Temujin was quite young, perhaps four or five years old, his parents moved camp and somehow forgot him entirely. He was left behind until the Taichiud people found him and kept him for a while before he was eventually reunited with his family. There was never any indication of a strong relationship between father and son. When Temujin was eight years old, his father decided to take him to find a wife - which in Mongolian terms meant giving the boy to that family to be raised and trained before marriage. Yesugei didn't take Behter, the son from his other wife, suggesting something about Temujin's status in the family.

On the journey, they stopped at a family where Yesugei saw a girl named Borte, about nine years old. According to "The Secret History," there was instant connection - fire in his eyes and fire in her eyes. Temujin wanted to stay with that family, so his father left him there. On the way home, Yesugei saw a drinking party and decided to join, hiding his identity. They were Tatars, and they figured out who he was and poisoned him. He managed to ride home but died within days.

## 2. Mother Hoelun's Survival and Family Abandonment

***"Mother Hoelun pulled her hat down over her head, she took her black stick, and she ran up and down the banks of the river digging out roots to feed the gullet of her brood."***

After Yesugei's death, someone from the family came to retrieve Temujin from Borte's family. They made it through the winter, but when spring came and the clan prepared to move to new camp, everything changed. During the ceremony for the ancestors, Hoelun was not told about it. When she arrived angry at being excluded, the old women made clear her status: "You're the one for whom we do not have to call. We will feed you if you come, but we do not have to take care of you." As a captive woman, she was not considered a real wife in their view.

When the clan packed up to move, they took Hoelun's animals. She jumped on the one horse she still had, grabbed her husband's banner (which contained his soul, his sulde), and raced around the people. The clan camped for one night, then waited until dark and took off. When a friend of the family tried to stop them, they killed him. Eight-year-old Temujin cried, but there was nothing he could do. The family was left on the steppe to die - four children (possibly five), Sochigel with two children, all abandoned.

Mother Hoelun's response demonstrated extraordinary resilience and determination. She fed the family through the winter by digging up roots along the riverbanks, finding whatever she could. Even at this young age, Temujin began helping, collecting fish and doing small tasks to feed the family. She saved every single child through what should have been an impossible situation.

The trauma continued. Temujin was later kidnapped by the Taichiud people and essentially re-enslaved. They put him in a kang - a wooden yoke like an ox would wear, trapping his arms and head. Every night he was taken to a different ger to be guarded by that family. During a celebration when most people were drinking, he was left with a boy who wasn't very smart. Temujin managed to use the kang itself as a weapon, turning it quickly to hit the boy in the head and knock him out. This became one of the first lessons for the Mongols: **anything that moves is a weapon**. This principle would prove invaluable for generations.

He escaped into the river to hide, still trapped in the kang, while people searched for him in the darkness. They gave up, planning to return the next day, but he knew one family he thought he could trust. At great risk to themselves - they were a captive family of the Taichiud - they sawed off the kang, burned it in their fire, and gave him food to escape. He then had to find his family again.

## 3. The Anda Relationship with Jamukha

***"They swore that they would be there forever to protect each other, to help each other in every moment."***

The relationship between Temujin and Jamukha represents one of the most complex and significant bonds in Genghis Khan's life. Jamukha was a boy about the same age as Temujin whose family had winter camp close to where Mother Hoelun lived with her children. Both boys claimed descent from the same woman about four or five generations earlier - an Uriankhai woman who herself was kidnapped. Jamukha descended from her through the child she was pregnant with at the moment of kidnapping, while Temujin descended through the new kidnapper, Bodonchar, his ancestor. As the Mongols would say, they came "from the same womb."

Their backgrounds were similar yet different. Both lost their fathers very early, but Jamukha also lost his mother and grew up in his grandfather's household with several wives - essentially raised by old women. He had no siblings, unlike Temujin's house full of siblings. This created a certain emotional deprivation despite better material circumstances than Temujin's family.

The two boys met playing on the ice during winter. In Mongolia, winter temperatures can reach 50 degrees below zero (where Celsius and Fahrenheit converge). When you slide something across the ice, it glides like silk for long distances. If you put your ear to the ice, you hear a celestial sound unlike anything on earth - like angels singing under the ice. In this magical setting, when they were about 10 or 11 years old, they decided to become **anda** - more than friends. There are several types of friendship in Mongolian (nokor being a regular friend), but anda is a friendship beyond friendship, something for life. They swore to protect each other forever and exchanged knuckle bones from roebucks (deer). These bones were used in games and for forecasting the future.

A couple years later, they renewed their vows. This time, as slightly older boys with bows and arrows, they exchanged arrows. Jamukha took horn from a two-year-old calf, whittled it down, and drilled a hole to make a whistling arrow. These arrows served multiple purposes - for signals between people and for directing animals during hunts by sending the arrow in the opposite direction to make the animal move.

When Temujin needed help rescuing Borte after her kidnapping, Ong Khan (who had been lord over Temujin's father) agreed to send troops but said Jamukha should also come. Jamukha raised troops and joined the expedition. However, his approach showed both loyalty and concerning traits. He gave a long, fierce speech about jumping through the smoke hole of the gers and killing everyone - men, women, and children - destroying the Merkit people forever. He was critical of elder people when Ong Khan's forces arrived late, lecturing them about Mongol promises and punctuality. He was very aggressive but very helpful.

## 4. The Kidnapping and Rescue of Borte

***"Life is not worth living without Borte. He has found something good in this life. And if he has to die trying to get her back, he will die trying to get her back."***

At age 16, Temujin's life transformed when Borte, the girl he had met when he was eight and she was nine, came with her mother to marry him. For a 16-year-old boy who had suffered every imaginable indignity, suddenly having someone who loved him was everything. It wasn't just his mother running around getting food and trying to feed five children plus the other wife and her two children - he had somebody who loved him. There was excitement, fire in the eyes. But it only lasted a few months.

Early one morning, an old lady visiting them named Kokochin (granny Kokochin) felt vibrations in the earth while sleeping on the floor of the ger. She knew horsemen were coming and roused the family. Mother Hoelun took charge. She put all her children on horses, took the baby girl Temulin in her own lap, and had one extra horse. But she wouldn't take Borte. She knew men were coming in the dark for a woman - they knew this family of outcasts had acquired a wife. She left Sochigel, granny Kokochin (who had her own cart), and Borte. They piled into granny's cart with only an ox to pull it, so they didn't get far before the attackers arrived. But Mother Hoelun was right - she got her children to the mountain, to Burkhan Khaldun, because the men were focused on the cart.

Mother Hoelun saved her family, but at tremendous cost. Temujin realized he had obeyed his mother but lost the most important thing in his life. This was the defining moment. The story began with his mother's kidnapping, but now with his wife's kidnapping, what would he do? Would he resign himself to it? Look for another wife? He decided life was not worth living without Borte. If he had to die trying to get her back, he would die trying.

He went to Ong Khan with a gift - the sable coat that Borte's mother had brought for Mother Hoelun at the marriage. Ong Khan agreed to send troops and told him to ask Jamukha as well. The three forces set out - troops from Ong Khan (though he himself was too old to go), Jamukha with his troops, and basically just Temujin with his brothers. They traveled through extremely rough territory up the Selenga River toward Lake Baikal to find the Merkit people.

They came in at night under a full moon. Some Merkit men were out hunting sables and raced back to warn the camp. Borte had no idea who was coming - she didn't want to be kidnapped again. She, grandmother Kokochin, and Sochigel were loaded into a cart to escape. Temujin came in searching for her, calling her name. She heard his voice, jumped off the cart, and ran to him. He grabbed and embraced her, then said clearly: "This is the goal. This is why we are here. We don't need anything else."

This was his first full military engagement. Borte was pregnant when they returned, which became a huge issue that lasted forever. His own sons later rebelled and called the first child "a Merkit bastard." But Genghis Khan defended his wife viciously, telling his sons: "You were not there. You do not know who loved who and who did not. You did not see the sky turning around. You did not see the stars falling. You did not see the earth turn over. You don't know what was happening. And if I say he is my son, he is my son. Who are you to say otherwise? You were not there. You come from the same warm womb, and if your mother could hear your words, her warm womb would turn to cold stone."

## 5. The Killing of Behter and Family Dynamics

***"A deer shot with words cannot be loaded on a horse. A deer shot with words cannot be eaten."***

The killing of Behter represents one of the most significant but least known episodes in Genghis Khan's early life. This event is completely absent from Persian and Chinese chronicles - it only appears in "The Secret History of the Mongols." Behter was the older son of Sochigel, and in Mongolian society, the older brother has complete authority over younger siblings. They must refer to him with a special pronoun "ta" while he uses "chi" for them - a formal hierarchy. His word is law; he is the father in the absence of the father.

It was quite common that if a man died and his brothers didn't marry his widow, and if he had a son by another wife, she would become that son's wife when he passed through puberty. So it would have been normal for Behter eventually to marry Mother Hoelun. Whether this happened or Temujin was trying to prevent it is unclear, but either way, Behter was both the older brother and potentially the stepfather. Behter was ordering Temujin around and taking things like fish or birds that Temujin had caught - perfectly acceptable in the Mongol hierarchy.

But Temujin would not stand for it. He and his next brother Qasar decided to kill Behter. They took sewing needles from their mother to use for fishing, and the record puts some blame on a fish incident, though the situation was clearly more complicated. They shot Behter with arrows and killed him.

The aftermath reveals fascinating family dynamics. Sochigel, Behter's mother, said nothing recorded. She and her younger son Belgutei stayed with the family and didn't leave. But Mother Hoelun was outraged. She screamed and gave the longest tirade imaginable: "You'll never have anybody in your life except your own shadow." She went on and on about how he was worse than everything terrible she could name. She was extremely distressed, while Sochigel's reaction (if any) isn't recorded.

The episode shows Temujin was capable of doing anything necessary to resolve what he saw as a problem. Behter was a problem; he resolved it at a very young age. But Behter's younger brother Belgutei joined the raid to rescue Borte and stayed loyal to Temujin his entire life. This demonstrates both the complexity of family relationships and Temujin's ability to inspire loyalty even after such violence.

## 6. Mongol Horsemanship and Military Foundation

***"The Mongol and the horse are inseparable. They live together, they know each other with every twitch of the muscle."***

The relationship between Mongols and horses formed the foundation of their military dominance. Horses were not just transportation but an extension of the rider's body and spirit. The Mongol language reflects this intimacy with an extraordinary vocabulary for horses - countless words for colors alone, far beyond simple terms like "brown." Words exist for smooth versus varied coloring, texture variations, and combinations that English cannot capture. Classifications extend to sex (including three categories with geldings), age, and reproductive status for females.

From absolute birth, Mongols were on horses. By three years old, children rode alone. When the official statue of Genghis Khan was built for the 800th anniversary, organizers had to consider how to present him to the world. They chose the Lincoln Memorial as the model - he sits as the great lawgiver in front of the Mongolian Parliament. But there's another well-known statue showing him on horseback without weapons, just riding in the countryside, which better captures the Mongol spirit.

In the 1990s, all jockeys for races had to be under six years old. Some were as young as three, racing without saddles because they couldn't use them yet. They just stayed on the horse while the trained horse did what it needed to do. Through this, they learned the horse and became one - not just one rider with one horse, but one rider with several horses. Herders typically had five horses for battle, and this ability to switch between horses was crucial for military operations.

The training was comprehensive and began early. Young Mongols learned to stand on horses while riding, then jousted with each other to see who could knock the other off. When their legs grew long enough for stirrups, they learned to shoot arrows and lasso on horseback. They made targets from leather pouches dangling from poles so they would blow in the wind, practicing hitting them from horseback at varying distances and speeds. These childhood games proved invaluable to horsemanship later in life.

Horses were defended against wolves, foxes, and in some areas even tigers. Mongols became excellent archers with composite bows far more powerful than those of sedentary peoples. The composite recurved bow, combined with the thumb draw technique that worked while bouncing on a horse, allowed accurate shooting at 200 meters or more while riding at speeds up to 60 kilometers per hour. The timing was crucial - shooting at the moment when all four of the horse's feet were off the ground during the gallop.

The spiritual connection was profound. Mongols would wipe sweat and dust off their horses and wipe it onto their own foreheads - the most sacred part of the body where the soul resides. They used small crops with slight whips at the end to hit the horse's rump, but never anything else. They were horrified at Western people using metal spurs in the stomach or metal bits that could harm the horse's head. Harming a horse's head was considered a capital crime.

Horses were religiously important. Fermented horse milk (airag) was used in ceremonies, with mothers throwing some to each of the four directions to start the day. The flags (sulde) were made from horse hair from their own horses, and in battle, horses would return to their source because they knew the smell of their flag - other members of their own herd.

## 7. Military Organization and the Decimal System

***"The army was extremely good in warfare, but small. He never got probably above 100,000, at the most 110,000. Your whole army has to be as finely tuned as each rider, each bow, and each horse."***

Genghis Khan's military genius lay not just in the weapons and horsemanship but in organization and strategy. The army that conquered the world would fit in a modern American stadium - perhaps 100,000 to 110,000 men at most. When facing China with millions in its army, Russia, the Middle East, Persia, and Afghanistan, this small force had to be as finely tuned as each individual rider, bow, and horse. The army itself became the super weapon.

The foundation was extreme loyalty. Genghis Khan's kinsmen had deserted him, his anda relationship was questionable, but all the others he found were common people - herders or hunters - who were loyal and never revolted or betrayed him. He organized using the decimal system. The smallest unit was the **aravt** - the squad of 10 men. The head of that squad had total control, but the men knew they would protect each other and had to come back with every member. No one was left behind. If you submitted to the orders of the man in the aravt, you knew he was risking his own life for you, and your brothers on the left and right were risking their lives for you.

Each man had five horses, a bow, and as many arrows as possible. They retrieved arrows after battle and could use enemy arrows - a great advantage in Russia where Russians couldn't use Mongolian arrows but Mongols could use Russian arrows. Every soldier had to carry needle and thread to sew torn garments, pieces of skin, or wounds. They carried dry dairy products (aarul) - dried curd that could keep for years. Put in a flask of water while riding all day, it would turn into thick protein. Mongols could easily go three to five days without building a fire.

The army was organized into left wing (East), right wing (West), and center (gol) - the moving center that was Genghis Khan's bodyguard and unit. Usually there was a vanguard and rear guard. The vanguard might go out as much as two years in advance to clear the land, run people away, and scare them so grass was left for the army. They never marched in a line one following another like other armies. They always went in long lines spread out in wings so each horse was on its own parallel path.

Genghis Khan used the best people and was willing to train them extensively. He never punished them for what happened. When Shigi Qutuqu (the supreme judge who wrote "The Secret History") lost a battle in Afghanistan - very unusual for Mongols - Genghis Khan went to the battlefield with him and said, "Okay, let's look it over, and you explain to me what you did, and then we will talk about it." He was thoughtful in training people around him. They knew they wouldn't be punished. It wasn't like countries where generals get executed for losing. Genghis Khan knew every general would try 100%, and if they retreated to save Mongol lives, he respected that.

**Promotion was based purely on merit.** This revolutionary idea, combined with the innovative approach to military tactics, created a feedback loop. People learning from mistakes and constantly improving were the ones promoted to positions of power. They inspired everyone else to do the same. If every action was judged based on excellence, repeated iteration in war created an increasingly powerful army.

## 8. Military Tactics and Innovation

***"Anything that moves is a weapon. This is gonna go on for generations. Very important for the Mongols. If it moves, it's a weapon."***

The Mongols had a base from steppe warfare - the horse, archery, and how they fit together. But Genghis Khan was very quick to embrace any kind of technology he saw. Sedentary armies and civilizations get stuck in their ways, making things a little faster, bigger, or stronger, but thinking the same way. Genghis Khan had no set way to think.

When he first encountered walled cities around 1209 in Tangut territory (northwestern China), he was a man who had never encountered a wall in his life except felt walls around his tent. But he looked at everything around him and saw the river with channels and moving water. For a Mongol, anything that moves is a potential weapon; anything that doesn't move is a target. Moving water, standing non-moving wall. He ordered men to dig a channel to bring down the Tangut city wall. They didn't know exactly what they were doing, the embankments weren't high enough, and too much water came from the Yellow River, flooding the Mongol camp. But they learned and improved. This strategy worked for the next 50 years, all the way to Baghdad in 1258.

**The feigned retreat** was used continuously and effectively. Mongols didn't fight for honor like Achilles in the Iliad. They fought for victory. There was no shame in retreating to save lives. Genghis Khan himself never fought a battle he thought he could lose, and he won every battle he fought. Retreat became a tactic. They would send in a small group to attack, then act defeated and turn back. But they could still fire backwards (the Parthian shot) and lean down to fire under the horse's neck for protection. They were firing coming and going.

Usually soldiers chasing them would break ranks. If they didn't immediately break ranks, Mongols would throw out loot and valuables. Soldiers usually couldn't resist. They'd come chasing after the Mongols in every direction, reach a certain point, and from behind two hills the Mongol army would come and slaughter them. This tactic worked over and over. It seems obvious in retrospect, but human nature makes people want to run after retreating forces.

Combined with the ability to move at high speeds and encircle, attacking flanks, this created devastating effectiveness. Mongols didn't like roads and would often come from directions nobody expected. The most famous example is Bukhara, where they came across the desert. Nobody had ever attacked across the desert, so when people saw dust coming, they thought it was a caravan. The direction itself was the surprise element.

**Terror was one of the greatest weapons.** Genghis Khan cultivated a reputation of ferocity. He won battles but didn't allow people to write about him. He encouraged refugees. When he conquered a city, he made sure there were plenty of refugees to go to the next city to weaken their food supply and terrorize people with tales of millions killed, steel-chiseled teeth, eating children. This propaganda and mental terrorism weakened the enemy.

## 9. Religious Freedom as Individual Right

***"Every person has the right to choose their religion. No one can stop them, no one can force them. The idea that it belonged to the person - no one in history had ever thought of that."***

Genghis Khan's approach to religious freedom was revolutionary and fundamentally different from modern concepts of religious tolerance. His first campaign outside Mongolia was for the Uyghur people in Western China, who were being ruled by Kuchlug, son of the Naiman King. Kuchlug had been Christian but converted to Buddhism, then outlawed the Muslim religion of his subjects and created oppressive conditions. The Uyghur sent a delegation to Genghis Khan asking him to save them. He sent a detachment that drove Kuchlug from power, caught up with him as he fled toward Pakistan, and killed him.

Then Genghis Khan made the first law he ever made for people outside Mongolia. Up to this point, tribal law focused on issues like kidnapping and sale of women, which he saw caused most feuding among tribes. But he observed that "civilized" people fought a lot over religion. So he made a law that was fundamentally different from institutional religious freedom.

Many forms of religious freedom exist. One allows institutions to do what they want - letting Mormons, Catholics, Jews, and Muslims each operate their organized churches. His law presumed and allowed that, but went further: **"Every person has the right to choose their religion. No one can stop them, no one can force them."** The idea that it was individual choice - that it belonged to the person - no one in history had ever thought of that.

This gave him tremendous support from minorities of many types who flocked to him. It was also practical politically - he recognized the power of having a balance of power between Shiite and Sunni, Christians and Jews. Giving every religion equal rights kept society from fragmenting against him or uniting against him. It was a kind of fragmentation he took advantage of.

He dropped all taxes on religious institutions of all types. The only religion he didn't recognize as a religion was Confucianism. He asked what they did - Taoists could do magic and give people formulas, but what did Confucianists do? People could still be Confucianist, but they didn't get tax-free rights. Eventually this was abused as religions got people to donate property (you can still use and farm it, but it's ours and now you don't pay taxes, just give us money).

Genghis Khan himself remained an animist who worshiped Burkhan Khaldun mountain, where he took refuge several times. He would go to the top, take off his hat and belt, and pray to the sky. Sometimes he would go away to pray about whether to invade certain people, and subjects would wait to hear what God would tell him. But he moved from just the spirit of the mountain to the sky as the one universal spirit everywhere in the world. In Mongolian, the word for sky, heaven, God, and weather are all the same: **tenger** (or Mongke Tenger for "eternal sky" in religious terms).

The sky could embrace all religions. He felt each person knew morality within themselves and could communicate with it - they didn't have to be taught from a book. As his grandson Mongke Khan said to Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Taoists: "You people have your scriptures, and you don't live by them. We have our spirits, and our shamans, and our drums, and we live by them."

## 10. The Role of Women in Mongol Society

***"When you have one million people, you've gotta use every one. The men are fighting, so he left women to administer a lot of things inside the country."***

The role of women in the Mongol Empire was extraordinary for its time and remains remarkable even by modern standards. This wasn't driven by modern ideological feminism but by practical necessity and Genghis Khan's recognition of capability. With only one million people ruling hundreds of millions across China, Russia, and the Middle East, every person had to be used effectively. With men fighting, women administered much of the country, particularly the economy.

Genghis Khan's daughters administered many ancillary Turkic kingdoms around the Mongols - the Ongud, Karluch, and Uyghur. His wives were in charge of administering Mongolia itself and handling the economy. In his wedding speeches to his daughters, he was very clear: "I give these people to you to rule. You have three husbands. You have your honor, you have your nation, and you have the man that I give to you. But the man I give to you goes in the army with me and brings me soldiers. You stay here and rule the people."

When Chinese officials arrived at the court of Alakhai Bekhi (one of his daughters), they didn't know what to think. She was ruling the Tangut area, could read and write, was a supreme judge, and didn't allow any death sentence without her permission. The Chinese didn't record which languages she could read and write, which has puzzled historians.

After Genghis Khan's death, powerful women continued ruling. When Ogedei Khan (his successor) died, his wife Toregene ruled the greatest empire ever ruled by a woman. She stopped all campaigns - there was peace during her time. Women like Toregene were extremely interested in economics and trade, running private corporations called **ortaq**. She recognized peace was better for trade and maintained peaceful conditions.

Sorghaghtani, mother of Kublai Khan, was perhaps the most politically astute. Though her husband Tolui was a drunk who died on campaign, she took over Northern China and began putting it together. She wanted her son Mongke to become Great Khan even though he was fourth son of the fourth son - far from the line of succession. She called a revolution and made it happen, putting Mongke in power in 1251. She was a Christian woman but had a Buddhist nurse for Kublai Khan and brought in Chinese scholars to tutor him. She planned for him to be a great administrator under his older brother.

The importance of women appears throughout "The Secret History of the Mongols." When Genghis Khan was rewarding people for great deeds, two men (Gel and Geb) wanted reward for saving young Tolui's life by killing a Tatar kidnapper with an ax. Genghis Khan said no - Altani saved his life by holding the hand with the knife until they got there to kill him. She was rewarded.

But "The Secret History" has been edited. In section 214, the story of Altani saving Tolui is complete. Section 215 begins: "Now let us reward our daughters" - but the rest is missing, cut out. Most translations render this as "And now let us marry our daughters," which completely changes the meaning. The areas ruled by these women were eventually taken over by their nephews as the women died out (not killed in their lifetime, but as they died, men took over). The record was edited to erase women's power whenever it threatened particular men's authority.

In Mongol court, women were always out front, always sat up front, always visible. This horrified the Chinese (good Confucians), Muslims, and Christians. They were scandalized that women even drank in public. The contrast with other societies was stark - women had real power and weren't hidden away.

## 11. Trade Networks and the Silk Road

***"Since Genghis Khan, there's never been a year without contact between East and West. It was permanent. Once he created it, it was permanent."***

Nomads in general were interested in trade throughout history, often serving as traders carrying goods from one city or oasis to another. The Mongols were extremely interested and dependent on trade since they could create very little in their home country - they couldn't grow much and didn't have technological skills for most crafts. Genghis Khan raised the status of merchants very high, which was particularly problematic in the Chinese world where merchants were considered extremely low.

He created a comprehensive system for trade. Merchants were taxed one time only - whatever the national tax was. They weren't taxed every time they stopped in a new town. He created rest houses or recuperation centers where merchants could get fresh horses, food, and deposit money for paper receipts usable anywhere in the empire. They were guaranteed protection. If they had to pass through dangerous areas, a small squad of men and horses would accompany them.

The Mongols supported trade in an unusual way. When merchants came asking outrageous prices (waiting for Mongols to bargain down), Mongols would say "I'll give you much more than that." Ogedei Khan was asked why he did this by a Muslim financial advisor who told him to stop paying more than people asked. Ogedei Khan replied: "Where's the money gonna go? It's still in my empire, it's gonna come back eventually."

The mere fact that Marco Polo and his uncle and father could cross the whole continent safely, taking two years but never being harassed, coming back with tremendous wealth - this was unprecedented. There's no well-documented case of anyone from China visiting Europe or Europe visiting China before the Mongols. But since Genghis Khan, there has never been a year without contact between East and West. It was permanent once he created it.

The exchange wasn't just goods but ideas on every level - technology, ideologies, beliefs, scientific information, agricultural goods, new crops for new areas. Genghis Khan had genius for knowing what skills people had that would contribute to his empire. Muslims were very good with arithmetic. He conquered the empire of Khorezm (from which we get the word "algorithm" from a mathematician there who invented algorithms). Muslims were using zero, which impressed the Mongols (Chinese were suspicious of it). Numbers were important to herders for keeping track of animals.

Mongols reduced all animals to the number of horses: five cows count as four horses, five sheep or goats count as one horse, four camels count as five horses. They took censuses of everything - one of the first things Genghis Khan did. Every place he went, he demanded a complete census with every house posting outside how many people, animals, occupations. They needed good mathematics for this, and Muslims provided it, becoming financial advisors (though sometimes ruthless in implementing tax policies).

Different groups had different roles. The combination of technologies created innovations. Chinese had gunpowder (mostly for fireworks and primitive hand grenades). Middle Eastern Muslims and Byzantines had naphtha (Greek fire flame throwers). Europeans didn't excel in much technology but could cast bells for churches. Take the bell, turn it on its side, use flame thrower principles and Chinese gunpowder - you have a cannon. By the siege of Baghdad (not in Genghis Khan's lifetime but soon after under his sons and grandsons), they were using primitive forms of cannon and firing rods.

## 12. Kublai Khan and the Conquest of Southern China

***"To conquer South China, Kublai Khan had to come up with new things."***

Kublai Khan was born in 1215, about three months after Genghis Khan conquered Beijing (then capital of the Jin Dynasty of Northern China). He was nobody - the second son of the fourth son of Genghis Khan, with lots of cousins who were real Mongols conquering Russia and burning Kiev. He didn't meet Genghis Khan until about seven years old when his grandfather returned from Central Asia and said "He doesn't look like a Mongol, he looks like his mother's people." His mother was Sorghaghtani from the royal family of the Merkit people.

His mother recognized the difference and treated him differently. Her oldest son was Mongke (later Mongke Khan), and she wanted him to become Great Khan. She called a revolution and made it happen, putting Mongke in power in 1251. Mongke died in 1259 on campaign in China trying to conquer Southern China. Up to this point, Kublai Khan had not distinguished himself. His mother had given him good education with a Buddhist nurse and Chinese scholars, planning for him to be a great administrator under his older brother.

But Mongke insisted on sending him on campaigns. Kublai was overweight, had gout, needed rest - there was always some excuse. Mongke assigned Uriyangkhadai (son of the great general Subutai) to teach him warfare. He wasn't great on the battlefield but was very smart. His territory in Northern China was being run into the dirt by administrators overtaxing and cheating people. His mother pulled his chain and told him to go to his land and take charge. He started learning how to administer.

When Mongke died in 1259, Kublai was on the Yangtze River on a campaign with no success. His youngest brother Ariq Boke was back in Mongolia and was declared Great Khan. But Kublai's wife Chabi sent coded messages telling him to forget Southern China and deal with his brother taking over the empire. Somehow she invigorated him. Even though he didn't have military strategy, he had Northern China with immense resources. He could cut off Mongolia, which was very dependent on Northern China for food. He united with the Golden Horde (they had Northern China and Russia), overthrew Ariq Boke, who was starved into submission by 1262 and taken prisoner. He mysteriously passed away in 1264 while a legal case was being brought against him.

The great objective left was finishing the conquest of China as Genghis Khan said on his deathbed. The Great Wall of Ships protected the Southern Song - a huge navy with ships chained together across harbor mouths. The Mongol system worked perfectly on grassland but by Hungary the grassland gave out, by Poland there were too many farms, by the Indus River it was too hot and humid with bows wilting and horses exhausted.

General Aju (grandson of Subutai) had gone with his father Uriyangkhadai on the conquest of the Red River in Northern Vietnam against the Dai Viet. The Dai Viet moved their army up by boat with elephants on the other side. Uriyangkhadai knew from Burma campaigns that the only way to route elephants was flaming arrows to the feet. He assigned one detachment to burn the boats so the Dai Viet couldn't escape. But those Mongols wanted to join the battle, not burn women's carts (floating carts). They left the boats. The Mongols won the battle but the Dai Viet got on boats and sailed back to Hanoi, evacuated the city, took all food, and disappeared into the delta. The Mongols "conquered" Hanoi but had nothing. They retreated.

Aju saw this and recognized the importance of water and boats. He studied the Yangtze River and every little river around it and the cities. The crucial thing: cities were heavily fortified on the land side where invasion comes from, with weak defenses on the water side protected only by the line of boats. That's where they had to attack. They sent to the Il-Khanate in Persia for engineers to build special trebuchets adapted for boats. They attacked the first city - it fell. They worked their way down the Yangtze River destroying city after city with this navy, with the army moving in after the navy broke through.

## 13. The Failed Invasions of Japan

***"The Mongols basically just did not know what they were doing. You can arrive with a trebuchet and throw grenades at the beach - it's not really gonna do a lot of damage."***

When Kublai Khan was conquering Southern China, he made a strange move: "Let's invade Japan now." Most people ascribe this to various reasons, but there was great logic. He had abolished his grandfather's policy of "Defeat and destroy until they are no more" and replaced it with a mercy policy to try to incorporate defeated people into the army. He had many defectors coming in, and because Mongols prized people with skills, clever people with shipbuilding and engineering were flocking to the Mongols while scholars hung out in Guangzhou doing calligraphy, poetry, and having contests.

There were very good reasons for invading Japan. The main one was to cut off the supply of sulfur needed for gunpowder in South Song. They had lost their sources in Northern China and got it from Japan. Also, if they could trade with Japan, defeated Chinese could potentially flee there, and he didn't want that. There was the idea of "kill the chicken to scare the monkey" - conquer Japan and maybe Southern China would surrender.

It was a total failure. Ships great on rivers and coasts were crossing treacherous water. Mongols didn't know what they were doing. Arriving with a trebuchet to throw grenades at the beach doesn't do much damage - it might scare horses but doesn't destroy cities. Japanese cities were more inland with Samurai on the beach waiting for Mongols to invade.

There was some fighting. The Samurai learned valuable things. They had such ritualized ways like Knights of Europe - coming out in armor lifted by crane onto a horse, riding out to recite genealogy before fighting. Mongols had no use for that - they were there to fight and win. But this was unknown territory. Weather turned against them, though credit should go to the Japanese for defeating them. Mongols weren't well-prepared, ships weren't very good.

In the first invasion, they did get off ships onto the beach with some skirmishes and small battles on land, but couldn't complete them successfully. They couldn't do their usual Mongol thing - they didn't have enough horses. Many tactical things were done incorrectly. It was the first time anyone had tried such a massive invasion.

But Kublai won his objective in a way. He stopped trade, stopped supply, cut off the possibility of the Song Dynasty fleeing to Japan. He ruled those waters and lands. It gave his navy experience with the ocean, and they were ready to move out around Southern China. They were closing in.

The second invasion was even more problematic. Kublai had this huge Song army after becoming the enlightened Mongol who doesn't slaughter. What to do with them? They weren't reliable or safe. He sent some up the Amur River, expeditions into Tibet, but there wasn't enough room or agricultural area for huge military colonies. Most ships were loaded with former Song prisoners not armed but with hoes and farming implements. He wanted to create an agricultural military farm in Japan to help feed Northern China.

The expedition was massive, organized in Mongol principles of left wing and right wing. This didn't work at sea. The left wing was from Korea with Korean ships, the right wing from Southern China with different ships. There was no center point - Genghis Khan always had the gol (center) in command. The two wings argued, didn't cooperate, sabotaged each other. They had the same problems even with lots of grenades. Grenades were exploding and scaring horses - impressive (many silk screens made later showing these battles) - but they lost.

A typhoon was the final destruction of the navy, but Japan had defeated the Mongols. Japanese deserve credit for that victory. While Mongols were away, Japanese developed good strategies knowing how Mongols fought. At night they could fire flaming arrows at ships to set them on fire, doing great damage. Kublai lost the invasion but the soldiers were gone - they drowned. He didn't deliberately kill them off, but the problem was solved. It's one of those ironies of history that's hard to understand.

## 14. The Postal System and Administrative Innovation

***"The yam united everything. People could move back and forth quickly. It could also take the plague out of Southern China into all parts of the world."***

The postal system called **yam** (or **toh**) was one of the most important administrative innovations of the Mongol Empire. It united everything and allowed people to move back and forth quickly across vast distances. This system became so fundamental that the word "yam" is still used for ministries in Russia today, showing the lasting influence even though Russians don't always want to acknowledge Mongol contributions.

The system worked through a network of rest stations where messengers could get fresh horses, food, and shelter. Messages could travel from Mongolia to Hungary in six weeks - an extraordinary speed for the time. This wasn't just for military communications but for trade, diplomacy, and administration. Merchants could deposit money at one location and receive paper receipts usable anywhere in the empire - an early form of banking that facilitated long-distance trade.

The efficiency of the system was remarkable. Every station was stocked and ready. Riders could travel continuously by switching horses, covering vast distances without the delays that plagued other empires. This allowed the Mongol leadership to maintain control over territories spanning from Korea to Hungary, from Siberia to the Middle East.

However, everything good comes with something bad underneath. This great system that united everything could also spread disease. The plague likely traveled along these same routes out of Southern China into all parts of the world. The very efficiency that made the empire strong also made it vulnerable to pandemic disease.

The system also had cultural impacts. It brought together people from different regions, facilitating the exchange of ideas, technologies, and cultural practices. Russian scholars, including Gumilev (though sometimes too romantic in his ideas), have documented extensive Mongol influences in Russia. Many Russian words have Mongol origins - "malchin" (herder) comes from "mal" (animal) and "chin" (person who takes care of animals).

## 15. The End of the Mongol Empire

***"Everything in history, everything that's good comes with something underneath it that's bad. And everything that's bad seems to have something underneath that sometimes works out good in a way."***

Despite Temur Oljeitu Khan (Kublai Khan's grandson) reuniting the Mongol Empire symbolically with all parts declaring loyalty to him, and despite having the greatest navy in the world, the empire eventually fell apart. He instituted a great era changing from conquest to commerce, sending envoys everywhere saying "We're no longer attacking anybody. We want to trade with you. Come to China, bring your goods." This created tremendous exchange all the way to Africa through Hormuz to Somaliland and possibly Kenya.

But the Mongols never adapted well to China and began having problems in different areas. In some parts of the world, they became more like local people. In Central Asia they became Muslim and got absorbed into that world, breaking away from earlier Mongol examples. Russia lingered longer under Mongol domination but got weaker over time, based around the Volga River until they became a tributary minority within a Russian Empire. But the Mongols had left the framework for Empire for Russia.

In 1368, the Mongols had become so weak within China they were overthrown. But they weren't absorbed into China. The Mongols had been there since 1215 to 1368 - they packed up and went back to Mongolia. It was just another seasonal migration. They said "We're still the Yuan Dynasty, we're not giving you the seals, we're not acknowledging the Ming," and they never did throughout the whole Ming Dynasty. They even went down once, captured the Ming Emperor, took him back to Mongolia, and tried to ransom him. The Ming said "We're gonna appoint another emperor," so the Mongols decided the worst thing they could do was give them back the old Emperor. So there were two emperors.

The empire weakened from internal reasons but also external things from nature - the great plague. The plague destroyed the Mongol system. If all these people are ruled by Mongols because they're benefiting from the system, and the system collapses, you don't need the Empire anymore. It just fell apart after 1368.

Most Mongols stayed in Persia, Iran, and Afghanistan. The Hazara People are still descendants from the army there. Some stayed in Russia, but in the time of Catherine the Great in the 1700s, many returned to Mongolia after hundreds of years. They were still Mongols despite centuries of exposure to other cultures. They came back to their tents, squatting around the fire, drinking fermented milk, and eating dried curds.

It was actually difficult because they were a little lazy and weren't so good at doing tasks. It became difficult to support so many people coming home and eating up all the animals. The Mongols in China had been used to just eating - they hadn't been producing much for 150 years.

## 16. "The Secret History of the Mongols"

***"History does not live in books. History does not live in archives, or even libraries. History lives in the people. History lives in the memory of the people, and the culture."***

"The Secret History of the Mongols" is the most important primary source for understanding Genghis Khan and the early Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan allowed nothing to be written about him in his lifetime - people couldn't take notes. He ordered the invention of an alphabet for the Mongol people (adapted from the Uyghur people, often called the Uyghur alphabet), and ordered his children to learn to read and write. But the only thing allowed to be written was law in blue books - nothing about him, campaigns, or military matters.

Shigi Qutuqu, a Tatar boy adopted by Genghis Khan who became supreme judge, recognized this great historic thing would be lost. He compiled the work (possibly with others helping, though it's unclear - Mongols always tell exactly where something happens but not always who contributed). It was written in the year of the mouse, 1228, at a specific location in Mongolia you can still visit today. Genghis Khan had died in 1227.

It begins with what might be myths or might be real history - the marriage of Gray Blue Wolf with Tawny Deer. Some say it's totemic mythology, but Mongols look puzzled and say "He was named Blue Gray Wolf, she was named Tawny Deer. They married." They're very practical about it and think they're real people. The earlier history is genealogy that may or may not be accurate, but by the time you get to Temujin's life, the information is intimate and detailed because Shigi Qutuqu was there, sleeping in the same ger with the people.

The document records intimate moments like Borte sitting up in bed telling her husband what to do. It was secret because it was only for the family, trying to uphold Genghis Khan's prohibition against putting out information about the family. Scholars began to think it didn't exist until the 19th century when a Russian academic working in Beijing discovered a manuscript that was all Chinese characters but made no sense in Chinese. If you pronounced it, it made sense to a Mongolian - it was in code using Chinese characters to record sounds.

Once they found it, they realized some Persian documents had incorporated parts of it already, which was helpful because some Persian sources are very trustworthy. Some of it existed in other Mongolian sources written later. It seemed fairly genuine but wasn't 100% pure - little things had been snipped here and there, words changed. Sometimes they call Temujin "Genghis Khan" when he wasn't Khan yet, or "Khan" (chief) versus "Han" (emperor) - there's a big difference in Mongol.

It wasn't published in English until 1982, though Francis Woodman Cleaves at Harvard translated it in the 1950s. It was supposed to be two volumes - the first volume is the translation, the second volume was going to be notes. The second volume was lost and hasn't been found to this day. Now it's in all languages just about in the world.

The document is crucial because the places are so exact. You can go to Mongolia and visit those places. Genghis Khan would know exactly where he is if he returned - there's no road, sign, building, power line. Just smell the air, feel it, see the animals and plants, and you begin to get a feeling for how he was thinking. You begin to see which direction they came from, the only direction they could come from. His life starts to unfold dramatically.

The text has no scenery, no props - Mongols understand their way of life and don't need to explain anything. They know which way the ger faces, where the sun is. But visiting the places and being with the people is how you learn it. History lives in the people. For example, the episode with Borte's kidnapping - visiting that place and talking to nomads there, they said "It's clear, it was winter." When asked where they read that, they said "No, granny Kokochin was on the ground and could feel the vibrations. Look, this is summertime now. You're not gonna feel any vibrations. The ground here is so soft." Suddenly an important piece came together from a nomad sitting next to his horse. It could only happen in winter, which correlates with other historic factors.

## 17. The Genetic Legacy Debate

***"Where did they get the DNA from Genghis Khan? They don't have one shred of scientific evidence. They found that a bunch of people are connected to one person, but they choose Genghis Khan. There's no evidence that it was from him."***

The 2003 paper "The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols" estimates that 0.5% of the world's male population is direct descendants of Genghis Khan. This finding has become popular but is viewed with skepticism by some historians. The methodology is solid in finding that many people are connected to one person from that time and region, but there's no DNA from Genghis Khan himself to confirm it was him specifically.

The connection could be from 200 years before Genghis Khan or from other Mongol leaders. Genghis Khan's descendants are almost all categorized and recorded - he's the largest conqueror in the world, so children don't just pop up everywhere. He had four wives all the time and had children with two of them, so there aren't a lot of descendants. His brother Qasar had many more children and caused problems later for the Empire by rivaling the power. It could have been one of these other people in charge who was the origin.

In Mongolia today, nobody claims descent from Genghis Khan. The methodology may have found some connection of people, but there's no evidence it's really connected to Genghis Khan specifically. It may be tangentially connected to him. The Hans came through, all the Turks came through - every Turkic nation descended from Mongolia. They all came out of Mongolia.

The implication that troubles some is the assumption this indicates mass rape. But you can't get those kinds of numbers with rape. If you wanted the empire to propagate genes, you would make sure all conquered lands are stable, flourishing, and happy. The paper actually indicates it's better explained by it being of high social status value to be associated with the lineage of Genghis Khan. For many generations, people loved the Great Khan. Given how vast the land was and all the transformational effects on trade and culture, it makes total sense.

The 0.5% is just male descendants. The way genetic trees work with women at each step, the number of descendants could be much larger. There are singular figures like this in history, but none like Genghis Khan. While the science is interesting and fun, attaching it specifically to Genghis Khan's name may be done for publicity and funding rather than scientific accuracy.

## 18. The Unmarked Grave and Legacy

***"Let my body go, let my nation live."***

Genghis Khan said "Let my body go, let my nation live" and chose to be buried in an unmarked grave. The Mongols believed very strongly it should always be that way. Most Khans who followed him were also buried similarly. Chinese emperors were buried in elaborate tombs, but not the Yuan Dynasty. Kublai Khan was buried back with his grandfather in an anonymous grave.

Not everyone was buried there - Guyuk died on campaign toward Russia and was buried out there, as was his father Ogedei. That was more their homeland. But many were buried with Genghis Khan. It's known and not known at the same time. Officially you should not know it, you cannot know it, it should never be disturbed. There will be no tour groups. The people of Mongolia believe he's in a certain place and believe they know where it is, but it's sacred. Nothing can be done - no roads, no buildings, no killing of animals, no chopping of trees. It's holy land dedicated to him and his family.

When asked what Genghis Khan looked like, the portrait was painted 50 years later by somebody who never saw him. If you look at portraits of Kublai Khan and Genghis Khan, they look alike except one's old and one's younger. This was probably because Kublai was trying to establish legitimacy as a real Mongol. But his grandfather said he didn't look like one, and Ogedei Khan and Mongke Khan looked different.

If you want to see the face of Genghis Khan, walk in any ger in Mongolia - the first child you see, that's the face of Genghis Khan. It's his nation. He created that nation. That's his face. He's everywhere. When you have clans still operating in Afghanistan, Russians still using the yam system, there are many aspects of him out there in the world.

The ideas live on. Thomas Jefferson found so much inspiration in the life of Genghis Khan and his books that he bought many copies and gave them to the Library of Congress, Library of Virginia, University of Virginia, and his granddaughter. These ideas live on: religious freedom, protections for women, protections for envoys and ambassadors. We still have not fulfilled them. We do not have religious freedom, we do not have protections for women, we do not have protections for envoys and ambassadors. Rulers do not live as common people, eating the same food, wearing the same clothes, sleeping in the same simple homes.

## 19. Lessons for Modern Warfare

***"Mongol strategy is first you take the countryside. You occupy the countryside and you cut off the city. It cannot live without the countryside."***

The Mongol approach to warfare offers profound lessons for modern military strategy, particularly in contrast to recent American military campaigns. No other power in world history has conquered Russia, China, Persia, Central Asia, Turkey, and Korea. Not Alexander, not the Romans. Nobody will ever do it again - nobody's going to conquer China and Russia and rule both countries.

The Mongol strategy was to take the countryside first. They were country people who thought in terms of countryside. You take the countryside, occupy it, and cut off the city - it cannot live without the countryside. They would come in sometimes two years in advance to clear people out so they would have room and pasture for their horses. They took small towns, then small cities, then finally the big city.

Americans followed the exact opposite strategy in Iraq. They said "We're gonna take Baghdad, bomb Baghdad, have shock and awe, conquer the country from Baghdad." They went in, got trapped in their little green zone, and never conquered Iraq - the strongest army in the world. This worked in Europe in World War II where cities were centers of production for the modern era. But the countryside produces food and supplies water. Cut off water and food from the city, and the city will surrender.

Americans were applying something that worked in Western Europe to conquer Germany but did not work to conquer Iraq, Vietnam, Northern Korea, Cambodia, Laos, or Syria. In Grenada it worked - that's the only successful war in recent American history, lasting a couple hours. Otherwise, America has been chased out of every country, tail between legs.

America dropped more bombs on Cambodia than on Germany. In Germany, you destroy the cities and people surrender - Dresden's gone, Frankfurt, Berlin. In Cambodia you can bomb the countryside forever, kill people (which they did), use chemical warfare (which they did). You can still go to Eastern Cambodia to large areas where you don't hear birds singing because of chemical warfare from American bombs.

Modern warfare is brutal. We paper over it sometimes. In World War II, America had unconditional surrender - you could support or not support the war, argue if it was done right or wrong, but there was clear policy. In Afghanistan, America was "fighting terror," "bringing democracy," "freeing women" - absolute sheer insanity. And killing people. Not only chemical warfare killing people in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, but killing American soldiers. Agent Orange killed American soldiers, including the author's father. But that doesn't count because he didn't die on the battlefield and they didn't mean to kill him.

Agent Orange was designed to kill all vegetation - supposedly a humane way to stop army movement through jungle and stop supplies. It defoliated and wiped out crops so people were starving (literally in Cambodia), animals were killed, deformed children are being born to this day. American soldiers died by the thousands - not immediately on the battlefield but going home with disease, lingering, taking whole families down in emotional trauma of becoming slowly paralyzed and dying. America did that to its own people.

War is hell. In some deep sense, everybody loses no matter the narrative put on top of it. War is acceptable in some situations, but the more controlled it is, the better. The effort isn't to do away with all things that happened under Genghis Khan with brutality, but to measure it against what goes on today in the world today.

## 20. Personal Reflections on Mongolia and Human Nature

***"Almost every day, I'm totally dissatisfied with everything on earth. But then almost every day, I meet somebody, just one person, who gives you some kind of hope."***

Mongolia is a world that for the most part is the same as when Genghis Khan was there. Unlike America (entirely different just a few hundred years ago), London, Moscow, or Constantinople/Istanbul, Mongolia is still Mongolia. It's one of the largest countries in the world in space with the fewest number of people - about 3.3 million spread out, living in their environment in an intimate way.

The first thing about the steppe is you can see forever in every direction - no building, nothing to stop your line of view. It's like being in the ocean. You have extremely open space with wind usually blowing through, extremely fresh coming out of Siberia and the Arctic, sweeping down across Mongolia. Cold as can be sometimes but always fresh. The smell of grass becomes very important. From one year to another, one area may have grass one year and drought the next, so you don't always know. If it's not grass, it's dust.

The waters are mostly pure (though unfortunately there has been pollution from mining in this century). Mongolians define their world by water. Genghis Khan didn't give lands to his sons to rule - he gave waters and people to rule. They don't refer to earth as land but as **dalai** (ocean, the sea). Water is very important. You don't camp by water - if you do, your animals and you will pollute it. They camp about a kilometer back. You take animals to the river to drink, then take them away. You don't bathe in the river - you take water away from the river and bathe away from it. The rules are very strict and clear from the time of Genghis Khan.

It's dangerous to live close to rivers because of flash floods in summertime that could wipe away camps. People live with nature in a way not seen anywhere else in the world. Even today with cell phones, solar panels, and TV in the middle of the steppe, they're living a similar life. Young people may drive motorbikes, but they're still herding cows, yaks, and camels - doing it the Mongol way.

The people take such good care of visitors. When the author's wife had MS and was slowly becoming paralyzed, they lived half the year in Mongolia partly because climate and altitude were better for her situation, but also because of the people. It was a poor country with broken sidewalks and things not working, but going out with her in a wheelchair alone, every bump would have arms picking her up and the wheelchair, lifting her over without making him do it. At the opera with magnificent Soviet stairs, two guys would come from each side and carry her without asking "May I help you?" or waiting for thanks. They just did it and walked away.

Singers would come to warm up the house for his wife. Dancers would come to dance, or people would play the horse head fiddle (**morin khuur**). If he was feeding his wife and anyone saw it, they would immediately take over and start feeding her. Children would always come to her (unlike in America where they're often afraid of someone in a wheelchair). You learn something about people living in a country where you come to a ger and never ask permission to go in - you certainly don't knock on the doorframe (that's hugely offensive, like insulting their hospitality). You walk in, sit down, and they fix food for you.

You can make camp somewhere with your own tent, and within one hour some child will be there with water and milk. The mother sends them over - "There's somebody over there in the forest." They believe they're obligated to take care of one another. Anybody in your area, you take care of them. Individuals give hope - people one by one or a few at a time.

Almost every day brings dissatisfaction with big things in the world, the way young people talk, the way people are. But then you see somebody doing something nice, often something young people do. In Asia they're always bringing things - dried curds, strawberries picked in the forest, pine nuts, milk in various forms, yogurt. Everybody thinks "You gotta eat the yogurt. This is from my grandmother, and all other yogurt in the world is not good. But my grandmother knows how to make the best yogurt ever." Over and over, despite intentions to be in a bad mood, somebody spoils you with these little nice acts that are really very touching.

Human nature shows that individuals can be good even when institutions fail. There's a certain love for individuals and persons but not for people in general, and especially not for institutions. There's great suspicion and mistrust in institutions over and over. Genghis Khan was very good at destroying a lot of institutions or bringing them to heel within his empire.

The long arc of history is full of atrocities as modern humans understand them with the wisdom of time and moral progress. But during each period of history, it was difficult for the majority of people to see where the line between good and evil is. Humans forever like to weave a story in which they are the good guys. Slavery was seen as normal through most of human history. Thomas Jefferson wrote "All men are created equal" (one of the most powerful lines in human history) yet was himself a slave owner - a fascinating case study of contradictions.

The consequences of moral failings can reverberate through decades, even centuries. That is perhaps one of the values of studying history. It is laden with atrocities but also contains people who, while flawed, dare to rise above the moral decrepitude of the day to try to build a foundation of a slightly better future world. As MLK Jr. put it: "The arc of moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."
