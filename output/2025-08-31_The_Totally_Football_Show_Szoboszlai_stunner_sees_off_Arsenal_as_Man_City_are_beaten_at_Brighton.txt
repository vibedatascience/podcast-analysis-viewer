Totally football show today. Premier League match day three. Liverpool Arsenal. Free kish. Free kick means free points for the champions. Did Arteta make classic student error taking too long getting his essay in. Also, Brighton beats City. Bulma's trip up Tottenham. West Ham win at Forest Palace are the Villa killers once again. And we talk about all that stuff, plus film and business, hurt by video, and a song about Newcastle. It's all in this Totally Football Show. Well, there you go. Hello. If you're watching us on YouTube, it's our Sunday night live record of the podcast, which possibly podcast listener, you're checking out on the Monday morning. Whatever it is you're doing, welcome to the show. As we record, it is Sunday the 31st of August and the we in question is this Tim Spears. All right, Tim. >> How's it going, James? >> Yeah, pretty good. Just been watching some football, >> some soccer >> with my friend JJ Bull. >> Hello. >> Hi, JJ. You're going to sing us a song later? >> Yeah. Yes. Good. The whole band's here. >> Excellent. And so at least from uh well on the big screen live from Glasgow is Daniel's story. Hello Daniel. >> Good evening James. How are you? >> Yeah I'm all right. You were in Glasgow for the old firm game on Sunday. How'd that work out for you? >> It was a game that happened. >> It was according to one uh XG Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers the lowest game for XG that they'd ever recorded. 0.33 combined. And >> yeah, if it boy did it feel like that, but also when you're in the stadium, you don't kind of notice that because everybody's just hating each other, which is what you're there for anyway. >> All right. I was sick and tired of everything when I called you last night from Glasgow. There you go. Uh no goals and barely any shots in that game for you there in Glasgow. But there was plenty that happened afterwards Sunday afternoon evening and pretty much night in a packed day of Premier League action. We've just seen Palace's win at Villa. There were away wins for West Ham, home wins for Brighton and Liverpool. Any we'll get on to all of that. We'll probably touch on a little bit transfer deadline day because that's if you're a podcast listener, that's today, isn't it? Monday at 7:00 p.m. right across Europe. The transfer window will slam shut. And it's been one of the biggest ever, Tim. Is that right? Numbers-wise, three billion spent or something. >> Yeah, numbers wise, it's been absolutely insane. >> What can we anticipate happening on Monday? >> Potentially the biggest deal of the whole window is still to happen. >> Do you think it will? Uh it's sort of I think the planets are aligning a little bit >> you know and you sort of factor in the Strand Lawson maybe you know edging towards which then frees up the fact that they can sell him >> right >> um >> for the other guy Mr. Ezak it be it would be the biggest deadline deal well ever obviously with with the money involved but also the stature of it I think. >> Wow. Is it what do you think Daniel? Is it going to happen? I still have absolutely no idea and we record with about what 21 20 hours left of the transfer window. >> All right. >> I still I feel like I'm going to be saying in about 3 weeks time I'm still going to be saying well if we can replace him and that domino falls then maybe he'll get his move. And I've just found the whole thing like really distasteful this year because of the behavior of players who think they can kind of force their way out of a of a contract to another club. And I'm really kind of proud of the clubs that have said, "Well, hang on a minute, mate. You signed a deal without a release clause, so you can shove your gentleman's agreement up your gentleman's agreement." >> Wow, Daniel's story. All right. I love it. Excellent. Let's move on from transfers and talk about things that we do know, things like results. So, Sunday night, Crystal Palace beat Aston Villa 3-0 again. Little bit earlier on on Sunday, Liverpool were one-nil winners against Arsenal thanks to an absolutely stupendous free kick from Dominic Dominic Slobers. In the two two:00 games, Brighton came from a goal behind to beat Man City 2-1. City have now lost two of their first three, while Nottingham Forest West Ham was nil nil until the 84th minute and then was 3-0 to West Ham a very short time afterwards. We'll be finding out why shortly from Tim Spears who was there on Saturday. Bournemouth were one-nil winners at Spurs. Everton had a very fine away win as well. They were 3-2 victors at Wolves. Uh meanwhile, it was at home to Burnley and it did take a stoppage time penalty, but but Manchester United won their first game of the season, 3-2 against the Clarits. Chelsea needed major help from VAR to overcome Fulham. Cruy ruling out Josh King's opener. Not that Josh King, but yeah. And there were controversial scenes at the Stadium of Light two with Brenford's Brown Kit. Newcastle leads ended goalless. Brenford, by the way, losing 2-1 to Sunderland. Leads leads Newcastle. No goals there whatsoever. Uh, Wolves are now bottom of the table. And on top of the table though, Tim Spears are Liverpool after their 1-0il win Sunday evening against Arsel, which is where we begin. Bit of coms, is it Charlie? What would it be? >> Does opposite goal? >> Of course. All right. Well, wasn't the greatest game, but that might just have been the greatest free kick we've ever seen. JJ, what do you think? >> Is it the best free kick I've ever seen? It's very good. That's a too much, I think. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, I'll go with it. Very good. It did. It was the moment that that game needed to make sure that we'd remember it. >> Yes. because apart from that, it was I think really thoroughly boring. I think it's probably very interesting tactically, but I find it so hard to watch because it was so unentertaining. >> Okay. >> That I didn't even really notice. >> You spent a lot of your time trying to compose a song that TV stations could use to promote their Sunday afternoon football games. Daniel, it was an unusual free kick, not least because it was straight down the middle. >> Yeah. On initial viewing, and I think on the first two replays, I thought that David Ryer had dived too late and pushed off not far enough with his foot to make a full dive. And then there was the angle almost from behind Shaw's lies back where you see just the kind of whip and the whip it was like curl without the ball ever slowing down, which is unusual, I guess, >> physically. Um, and yeah, there was nothing he could have done because he he he dives as if the ball was going to be a foot or maybe a foot and a half away from the post and then that late dip just takes it onto the post. I mean, it was you couldn't have placed it any better as Peter Drury was very keen to tell us. >> Yeah, it went up, it went down, it moved across. It was absolutely brilliant. It was from miles out as well, what 30 30 yards out. You've been on your way back from Nottingham, Tim, so I'm not sure if you were able to catch it, but it was a astonishing moment. >> It's also great to see it from the referee's chest chest. >> So good. Right. >> Yeah, that's that's an angle we've never had before. >> Is that where they keep the camera on the referee's chest? >> I presume it's not here. >> It's a circle here. Yeah, >> that's where I would put it. >> Maybe it'd be too disorientated. >> Oh, yeah, cuz he moves his head, doesn't he? Fair enough. He had a great game anyway. Slobs lie uh in the new attacking sort of right back Allah Trent position. There was an amazing ball that he pinged up to I think it was Gakpo in very TAA fashion earlier on in the game. >> Yeah, he's got that in him. Um also there's a few games when he's either played at right back now. He's played a couple now, but uh in other games when they've had a different player playing in the right back slot like Juansa last season, there's often times so would be dropping deeper to be able to offer that like the progression from the back cuz he can ping those balls and then join in. And although he's definitely really definitely meant to be like a central attacking midfielder, he's done the right back stuff very very well. There's a couple of occasions when he was one v one on the side defending did very well. Um, I don't think he'd want to change his position to there, but he I mean he's done very very very well so far. >> Okay. How much was this Arsenal throwing away two points as opposed to sorry three points? No, actually, how much was this an amazing piece of skill from Slobers that you can't legislate for? And how much was it Mikuel Artetta throwing away a game that was there for the gunners by being overly cautious? for example, and I'm paraphrasing a little bit, Gary Neville kind of slamming the Arsenal manager's approach because the gunners take all their risks at the wrong end. What What do you think, Daniel? Daniel, you're right there. >> I Yeah, I think to an extent I think that that was the the criticism Arsenal was in on this occasion slightly driven by the narrative of an absolutely freak free kick. And Arsenal did come into the game without Saka with Erdigard on the bench and with Celiba getting injured after five minutes in their probably their hardest league game of the season. So I do have some sympathy in the isolation of today's game. The problem is that Michartetta is picking up a reputation as somebody who has been quite defensive in some of these games. He's he also two years ago got accused of being kind of bizarrely cavalier in this fixture when Arsenal were two nil up and went for a third and got done 2-2. Uh he hasn't found a balance therefore yet. He has also as Arsenal manager and they weren't particularly good for some of these years but as Arsenal manager he's played 15 games away at Man City and Liverpool in all competitions and hasn't won one yet. And the longer that run continues, as more and more money gets added into this squad, >> um the more that will become an issue. What it does, it really puts pressure on the games that Arsenal were bad in last season, which is breaking down low block teams. Um because yeah, you're already you're not quite at the stage obviously yet of you can't afford to lose games, but it cost you double if you lose at your rivals. >> Absolutely. Arsenal conceding their first goal in this game. Liverpool by contrast keeping their first clean sheet. Tim, again, you didn't catch enough of this probably to comment. >> No, I saw a fair amount. I think I think the thing with Arsenal, it's just it's it's happened too many times now for it not to be a coincidence that that it's a mentality issue and Martetto talks quite a lot about this sort of or hints that this been their time and how and he's got the team and the club to a certain level and now they need to kick on and start winning things. You know, he said this very explicitly in May, and you kind of wonder, has he has he bought in enough winners for them to take that mentality step for them to switch that mentality from being sort of runners up and not winning a thing for 5 years? How do they how do they then morph into champions? You probably go and buy a couple of people who've been there and done it. They haven't really done that. I think they've got the the defense and now probably the attack and the squad depth to be good enough to win the league, right? But you watch them in these big games and they haven't shown that they've got the mentality to be championship. That that would concern me slightly. >> Okay. And Liverpool >> um well the biggest negative from their opening three matches was their defense and to to shore that up and and and win the games a huge plus. They just look seamless to me. You know, they've lost key players as well. Fong was a was a was a big miss today. Um but they just they just carry on regardless. >> Was he a big miss? Who would he come in for at this point? >> I think well that certainly the way that Slots tried to change the team with the attacking fullbacks and you know more direct approach that that was that was the evolution that they were going for this season. So I would have thought he'd be still be playing at right back. I suppose that's what I'm fitting in. >> Okay. All right. Then Aaron writes in hello Aaron says in the past 10 seasons the team that scored the most goals won the league seven times whereas the team that conceded the least goals won the league four times. I'm slightly troubled because you said in the the past 10 seasons and that makes 11 for me. But I take your point which is is the old saying attack wins games, defense wins titles now a myth? Arsenal after all conceded the fewest goals over the last two seasons. Is that now gone? Do you think Daniel? I think what has happened and this is me dodging that question almost completely but I think what has happened is that increasingly big six matches are decided particularly title race matches are decided by incredibly fine margins and I think the criticism of Arsenal is that they have allowed themselves to fall the wrong side of fine margins so often that you begin to question whether uh it's just bad luck or whether there is a slightly different way of playing games like these that could have been more beneficial. You know, we Liverpool defended really well today, but they also came into the match with everybody talking about their defensive wos and their issues and Arsenal basically allowed Liverpool to grow into the game to play the first half pretty much as they wanted, albeit not with attacking very much at which point we expected Arsenal to really try and go at them. And again, Liverpool were able to just kind of grow the impetus over the course of the game. You could sense that in the noise from the crowd that they sense that Liverpool were growing into the match and that they were starting to in the second half starting to put more pressure on. It was a freak goal. But as I say, if you fall the wrong side of those margins too often, people start to ask why. >> So true. Adding to the injury list that you mentioned earlier was uh William Ciba inside five minutes of this game. Not sure how long he'll be out for. We've got the international break coming up of course and a reinforcement arriving in North London in the shape of Pierro Henapier who's coming in from Leverkus and all right good news anyway for Liverpool not just the three points but the back but the fact that not only Arsenal but also Manchester City lost on Sunday. We'll get on to what happened to City next. Check out our new Saturday show, Totally Extra, if you fancy a bit of easy listening. This week, we're grappling with a variety of enigmas, including Nicholas Nicola Enela and why Julian Laurance likes cricket. If you fancy us having a chat about another topic, get your requests in. Next week though, for the international break, we're going to be doing Colombia in the '9s. certain amount to talk about there. Also should mention that on Tuesday we'll have our European edition of the Soie Football Show out with all the continental news including the greatest hattrick anyone's ever seen. JJ >> or Joe Nevs. >> Yeah, maybe. And also Eric Tenhog news. He's had two games at Bakusen. He's already on the verge of getting sacked. Extraordinary. What's all that about? And Jamie Vardy on his way to the Italian league leaders. Find out all the deets on Tuesday or anytime thereafter. That's the magic of podcasts. Now, also on Sunday, loads of other things happened. You had Palace's stirring win at Villa. You had the West Ham victory by the same score lines, 3-0 away at Forest, which Tim will be telling us about in a moment or two. But first of all, what did Brighton do to Man City Sunday lunchtime? tremendous last half hour to this game. Now JJ, you caught the last half hour. Who else actually saw the way this game turned around after Oh, Daniel after Fabian Herzel executed a a a quadruple a substitution and really turned the game and City had had no response. So tell us more. I yeah I wonder if this is a a kind of new trend in the age of deeper squads. And I also think I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here, but at most clubs now there's a a smaller gap between the players in the first team and the players on the bench. You can now use five substitutes. The benches are deeper. So if you are trailing in a game, it feels like a bit of a roll of the dice. But if you're Brighton playing against Manchester City, then a roll of the dice is fine. So you change 40% of your outfield players and immediately the opposition doesn't really know how to cope with everything being different and Brighton it won't work every time but Brighton maximize it perfectly by you know two of the players they brought on scored uh and they just unnerved City. I think there is a weakness in City. I kind of went through all the the stats because it kind of flagged an alarm in my mind since the start of last November. City have in the Champions League and Premier League have lost six games that they've taken the lead in. So they are get atible when they take a lead. In the three league seasons prior to that they hadn't they've done it once. So there is like an issue is issue now with City where they're not able to control games with the lead as much as they can and you can unnerve them but Herz did it absolutely brilliantly. >> Right. What get on? Am I on? Actually I can't hear hear myself. That's weird. Hold on a second. Excuse me. Yes. Right. Okay, there we go. That's better. Um, we'll get on to the reasons for this lack of We'll get on to the reasons for this loss of control for City perhaps in a second or two, but James Milner just remarkable. He was one of the players who came on who scored, converting the penalty. The game basically had seen Erling Holland uh scoring early on his 88th Premier League goal in his 100th Premier League appearance and it looked like that was going to be the story. And then you get the changes made by Herzel. Brighton win a penalty and James Milner steps up, converts becoming in the process the second oldest goalcorer in the Premier League era. Teddy Sheringham still holds the top spot there. But he's not only James Milner the second oldest goalcorer at 39 years and 239 days, but he's also of course still the second youngest goalcorer ever in the Premier League. 16 years and 356 days when he scored his first Premier League goals. There are 23 years between those two scoring strikes. As Colin Miller points out, when he scored his first goal, James Milner, James Trafford, who he scored against, was only two months old. Rajan Grudder, who scored Brighton second, was not even a twinkle in his parents' eyes. Erling Holland was a 2-year-old. and Brighton boss and James Milner's boss Fabian Herzel was only 9 years of age. James Milner everybody and just to say as well since I've been talking for about a minute, may as well keep going. He did the Gioto PlayStation celebration as well in homage to the to the departed friend whose number he now wears because he's changed to the number 20 out of this season. Milner. >> Yeah. Also, James Milner, I'm older than him and this all makes me feel weird >> because you grow up watching footballers and then they always seem like even though they're like you always think footballers are younger than you. >> Yes. >> Um but you al no way you always think the footballers are older than you. You always think like you're looking up to them but then you reach a certain age as we we all discover, right? >> And then suddenly that changes a little bit and it's very odd talking about them because then it changes where your position is, you know? And I think what James Milner was doing at 16 and still now, >> it's incredible >> compared to what I'm doing. >> Well, JJ, we'll talk about what you're doing a little bit later on. You know, everybody's pushing ahead in their own field. I think I feel like James Miller's achievements are better than mine. And I think that's fine to say, but uh he's also like how important he's been at various different massive clubs. like he's had so many different careers like you think like he came broke through at least I think right when he was great there >> was quite important for Newcastle sort of but then you go to like Liverpool really important there Man City as well obviously who he scores against today >> and now you can put him into that Brighton team and hope that he can help get everyone else up to the level it needs to be sets a standard in training right >> you need these players >> yeah and he's still got probably another five years in in Napoli or somewhere like that >> yeah I think so yeah >> just magnificent I it was Um when he stepped up I was nervous for him because he hadn't scored a Premier League goal in six years but Daniel he was so calm. >> Yeah he's a a lovely guy. He is one of the good guys. Um what you see is what you get. He is as JJ says incredibly hardworking. Like none of that is by accident. He is a manager's dream not least a manager who is as you say younger than him and therefore can use him as a kind of disciple on the pitch. he's everything you want. Brighton have been sort of led the way with those sort of players. They did had Adam Lana doing it for a while. Uh and now Milner and I think yeah I think especially in a club where there's quite a lot of transfer churn and the model is to buy develop and sell and bring in again those players just become the glue and Milner is perfect for it. >> Do you remember when he was it was boring James Milner and he used to and then he lended into it and effectively killed it. No one even talks about that now, but for a while there were he would do videos of himself on Twitter and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. And and he's he's universally liked by all of his clubs. You have to mention Aston Villa. JJ left out just for the Aston Villa fans, you know, screen was there. Sorry. >> Um but everybody he's he's completely non-offensive. Everybody just every everybody loves him. >> Well, he was on offense today putting Brighton level. And then Brajan, is it Brajan Gruda? What part of that transfer churn that Daniel mentioned? Scored a a very fine second. sitting who did he sit down? City defender >> 8 Nory sitting Ryan 8 Nory down and the keeper Trafford and giving Brighton the lead criy uh City by the way starting this game with Rodri which was supposed to be the key ingredient for them. In fact I think it's something like 50 matches that they played. a lot of matches anyway that that that he played for City without without them ever losing. Uh, in fact, let me just You know what? I'm going to do that again for the podcast version. City, by the way, did start this game with Rodri, which was supposedly the key thing key thing for them not losing, but lose they did, making this the worst start to a season in Pep Guardiola's career. Criy. Next up for them after the international break, they've got a Manchester derby against the United team that's actually six places above them in the table. That's how dramatic things have got. Is it all that dramatic, Tim, or is it actually just August and they've got a lot of new players? They have got new lot of new players, but they have been planning for this since January when when they they started to put together this this season's team. I think the Club World Cup's probably probably had a bit of an impact on their preparation for the season. And also, yeah, Rody's back, but Krikey, you know, he's going to need a little while to to get up to speed. And midfield was the biggest issue for them last season. But yeah, of course, it's just it's a you know, they they look so good on the opening day, Wolves, and and you think they're back, but then you remember that it's Wolves. >> So, uh so yeah, no, you you definitely be be slightly concerned. Well, Daniel, you mentioned the lack of control and a lot of people pointed to that the fact that that used to be Pep's way of completely steamrolling championships and it's doesn't seem to be there at his command anymore. Why is that? >> I mean, it it's an it feels like an easy answer, but it strikes as at least partly a mental thing. It's sometimes when elite teams things start going wrong, it becomes very hard for them to process that because things have not gone very wrong before. I think that was what certainly was happening at the beginning of last season after the good start. It it felt like one defeat inevitably bred two or three and nobody could really work out how to fix it. And they have also lost their air of invincibility and I think that's probably permanent now for however long Guardiola stays. There were times when teams, non- elite teams, would go into league games against City and and think if we lose two-0 or 3-0, we'll take it and we'll move on to the next. I don't think any club now, and it's a credit to the Premier League, I suppose, but I don't think any club goes into any game and thinks we haven't got a chance here, so we should just roll over and keep the score down. And losing that invincibility when you're already not quite got that belief, yeah, you can get at them. And the I do believe that the more it happens, the more likely it is to happen again. >> All right. Well, Manchester United after the international break of course won that fixture last season. Uh Man United 2 won this weekend. And we'll get on to that game a little bit later. But Tim, first of all, tell us about what happened at the City Ground on Sunday where Nottingham Forest came unstuck against West Ham, Jared Bowen, Paketa, and then Callum Wilson, making it 3-0. Wow. So, what happened around the 80minute mark? >> Well, nothing had happened before then, and I was thinking, what on earth are we going to talk about when I'm in the studio later? It was a real nothing game. Forest had one shot in total in the first half, which the lowest they've had since promoted back to the Premier League. I couldn't work out if West Ham were trying to kill the game and play for nil nil, or if they were just incapable of taking charge of it, but the sort of longer it went on, the more they grew in confidence. Um, and it was sort of tale of the two number 10s, Gibbs White and Pakatar, were both utterly dreadful. I've never seen I can't remember Giz White playing that badly for a long time. It's like he had concrete boots and he was furious with himself. he was jumping on the spot with all the the terrible decisions he was making and Pakatar was just continuously giving the ball away. But yeah, then some the subs changed the game actually. Um Callum Wilson came on, >> right? >> Um I had absolutely no expectations for him to do anything whatsoever. >> Um you know, he hasn't scored for a couple of seasons and he's not been fit for a couple of seasons either. Um but he was great. He was a couple of jinking runs and a couple of good shots and sort of got West Ham going again. >> Right. And Cresentio Somerville. Exactly. >> Okay. >> Yeah. Well, his first appearance since Potter's first match, which I wasn't aware of. He'd been been out for that long, but he sort of >> So, since Potter came in last season. >> Yeah. Yeah. His first game Somerville played, but not since then. Um, and he sort of just takes the ball and drives with it and um Matteas Fernandez, who's making his debut and did really well, he was doing that as well. It gives West Ham something a bit different. They've looked so flat in the open weeks of the season and so on paced, but Somerville and Fernandez and Callum Wilson um just sort of changed the game and they're basically West Ham scored three times in seven minutes. Just just before then it was it was on well I say knife edge a very blunt knife edge but the away end was singing um >> wooden spoon >> the away end was singing Frank Lampard's name which I don't know if that's something they do very often. Um, I've not heard them single, but they were singing in Fran Lamp's name and you'd think, you know, they didn't do that a lot when he was still playing because he moved to Chelsea, but obviously he's doing very well at Coventry and, you know, West Ham heading for another, you know, I guess not a great result. And then, yeah, everything has changed with with three goals in in seven minutes. Um, the whole outlook for them has been completely transformed, >> right? >> And a couple of really interesting points of note. One, Lucas Pakitar reported by The Athletic that he didn't want to play in this game. Okay. >> Amid uh discussions with Aston Villa trying to sign him, um he does play. He scores a second goal, which is penalty. And then his celebration is something I've never seen before. He basically mimics >> um uh turning down a phone call on his phone. >> Yeah. He's got his he's got his uh which finger is that? A finger and a thumb extended to mimic a a flip phone. Talks on it, throws it away. >> Yeah. And then kisses the badge. Right. >> Which is just absolutely hilarious. you know, >> so he's not going anywhere. >> Apparently not. Um, and then Potter with a his personal express it was a bit sort of tend Man United kind of like you you shouldn't after the FA Cup final like you shouldn't you shouldn't doubt me and sort of taking the journalist on a bit. Um, not happy with a culture that criticizes him for three consecutive defeats at all. Talked about the state of the world on three occasions >> saying this is the world that that we live in and he's not happy with it at all. Um and then basically said look at the this is why I'm sat here and with the greatest of respect you guys as in journalists are sat there cuz I I can do the job. I've done it for 15 years and I believe in myself. I was slightly more animated than Gra. It wasn't quite as as sort of you know aggressive perhaps. >> Wow. >> Um >> but yeah really interesting game and then and then Nuno I've never never seen him so angry or use such emotive language. He he said it was shocking truly shocking performance. Um he said everyone was very upset. Uh he couldn't explain it at all and yeah amazing really how it just turns in seven minutes. >> It is extraordinary but I guess that's football isn't it? Yeah. Nuno walking off the pitch with a a face like thunder and it it seemed that things had become a bit more amicable or calmed down a bit between him and the club last week. But where this leaves them with ahead of the big meeting with Marianis I don't know. Daniel probably you've got a view on that as a Forest fan. I just want to give a shout out to Callum Wilson who I had the opportunity to sit alongside a little bit over the summer and what a the sweetest guy really such a nice bloke and as you say it's not been a it's been a while since he scored but the way as he kind of I'm going to call him powered up field for the third goal. He kind of swerves one way and then kind of hauls himself in the other way and then does it two or three times by the end he's hypnotized the defender and through he goes for the header. Boom. Great for him. He was obviously an an underwhelming signing. You can imagine a 33-year-old free agent with a with a bad recent injury history and no goals for two years. Plus the fact that he's made a couple of tongue-in-cheek banteresque comments about West Ham on his podcast Antonio which were picked up and retweeted. You know, West Ham fans unhappy about Cudus leaving and not a great summer of recruitment. So, he's not the last person they want to see, but you know, they were underwhelmed by it. So, great for him to score basically. Although he did he did ruin >> potentially one of the greatest goals I would have ever seen live >> really. >> Jared Bowen the first person that came to mind was Diego Maradona. He goes from one side of the pitch to the other taking on sort of three four players a crazy was sort of John Barnes at the American R kind of that angle right and he's about to put it in and Callum Wilson just gets in the way and tries to shoot and Bowen is furious. He's like what are you doing? >> They have a chuckle >> eventually. Yeah, >> eventually it reminded me of when Michael Owens scores that great goal in the 98 World Cup and Paul Scholes is almost gets in the way because at the end he doesn't know what to do and sort of get out the way of the run. But they were 3-0 up. So >> yeah, I'm sorry you missed out on what would have been a very special moment for you Tim on what's otherwise been a difficult weekend. Daniel, very briefly, uh, does this where does this leave us with, uh, Nuno and Forest? And how comforted are you at least with the draw for the Europa League, which will pit you again. You being Nottingham Forest in this case, pit Nottingham Forest against Malmo in a rematch of the 1979 European Cup final, which Forest won for anyone who's not aware of that. >> Yeah, it's I think that is well that's a very small silver lining today, but it is a it's probably the perfect draw. You've got Bettis away which is big club. You've got Porter at home which is big club. Then you've got winnable home games including Malmo and then you've got short away trips. So that's perfect. But the question inevitably over the course of this international break will be whether Nuno gets there to manage in the competition. And it's just the worst timing for a performance like that. It's comfortably the worst performance of Forest under Nuno since he joined. Um though it reminded me a little bit of the the 1-0il home defeat to Everton last season when they really needed a win and so we're pushing and pushing and pushing and then Maria made a bad mistake and they got broke on to lose 1 nil in the final minute. Um and there is a sense that particularly when they have to break down teams they couldn't do it in preseason. Um the passing is just a little bit too slow. It it feels odd in that really that should be Morgan Gibbs White's best chance to shine when Forest need to break down a team and he's a kind of lock picker but actually I think he struggles most in those sort of games when it's all on him to pick the pass. He tends to sometimes try and do the difficult thing rather than the easy thing well and yeah I mean it was just a shambolic result but but fair play to West Ham because they came with a game plan put a change system from three at the back to four at the back. It looked more solid. They soaked up pressure, barely conceded a shot of note, and then hit Forest at the end, which is pretty much a perfect away performance. >> Absolutely. All right, Sunday night then, another London team, Crystal Palace going away to Aston Villa and notching up a fine 3 victory. It was the first defeat for Villa at home in over a year. Second time in a row though that they've lost 3-0 to Palace who have the wood over them as they say because they did them in the FA Cup semi-finals on their way to lifting the trophy just last season. Was it Mark Gay's last game for Palace? If so, he marked it with an absolutely monstrous goal. Jojo, what was that? >> Uh I didn't know he had that in him, but I like that he did. I said to you earlier, it must be very frustrating if you're a a forward or or if you're a defender and you have what Mark Gayhei had in that ability to hit a ball from just the corner of the 18 yard box, picking it perfectly into the top corner was the only time I've ever seen him take a shot. I think >> when he must watch all his teammates do this all the time and not do it. >> Yeah, >> they should have 11 marquees. >> That would be extraordinary. They may not have any of course by this time tomorrow because Liverpool are circling. Palace apparently have already turned down one bid but who knows if Liverpool might not be uh returning. I mean we we'll find out in 24 hours unless anyone's got any info on that. If not, let's just talk about other things from this game like Marteta. After Kamadada had been brought down by Bizo who was in goal for Villa, Mateta stepped up, scored the penalty and they got booked for kicking us the corner flag which is his goal celebration. Anybody know why this referee decided that he was going to book him for that? >> It's the Premier League's clamp down on fun that they've had this weekend in all the televised games. Ah yeah >> as part of that I think some sort of conspiracy to enjoy to ruin my enjoyment of the games. Don't know why that is though. So we were talking about this earlier as well. He's led kick it at park >> right >> but >> and at Wembley but not now. >> Not now. I don't know. The third goal came from Isma and what happened in that one? Can anyone remind me? >> Long throw. >> Oh the third goal came from Isma as a result of a very long throw. And we also got a little glimpse of Yere Pino. with the new signing as well. He looked lively. >> He's a great player. Yeah. So, he's been um like touted as a wonder kid for a long time. I think he's a V Royale, I think, but no one's ever managed to well either tried to get him or haven't been able to pay the fee. It's meant to be really high. And the fee that Crystal Palace paid, I think it's about 30 something million. That's I mean, from what uh I know of Pino, that is a really good deal. And I think you saw just that one little bit where he took the ball and then dribbled it past a bunch of players and they made the right decision every time not to keep going too long, when to stop, when to pass. But there's also a bit where they had a little breaking play and he went to the manager and there was tactical instructions. I think they were telling him not to go wide then. They should go inside now. And you can see him going like, "Okay, I understand that." So he's going to learn what he's expected of him. And I think uh if he performs anywhere near what I've seen him do in La Liga, he should be really fun. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> He had a bad knee injury a couple of years ago, didn't he? which I think has sort of brought his value down a bit, but it's half the price of Pez, you know, pretty good replacement potentially. >> Hopefully. Yes, >> Tim. If next summer Wolves would be looking for a manager, you'd have Oliver Glassner out of contract at Palace. You'd have Marco Silva at a contract at Craraven Cottage. You'd also have Andoni Rayola now free of his contractual obligations to the Cherries. Which one of those would you pick? >> I mean, we might be looking for a manager in the autumn, let alone next summer. Yeah, but that's when their contracts out >> purely hypothetical. Uh I think Marcus Silva was massively underrated manager. I would probably >> But what Glass is doing at with Palace is amazing. No, >> the players that he's lost, the players he could still lose. >> Yeah, they look they just look so settled. They look ready. It's probably help that they've had the Community Shield and getting prepared for Europe, but they just they just picked up where they left off last season. It' be a real shame if they lose Gay as well. It's going to be impossible to replace at this stage. Well, that seems to be Glastoners's position as well that he'd rather he'd rather the club took the hit of him leaving on a free than see him go now with >> they've already lost 30 million on the 65 that Newcastle offered last summer. >> You know, it's it's it's it's an awful lot of money to a club like Palace. >> Okay. What to make of Villa who are currently second from bottom and the only team in the Premier League yet to score a goal. Daniel, >> I mean they they feel like without wanting to deflect from Forest result today, they feel like the Premier League's random crisis club, you know, every weekend someone is the crisis club. Your job is not to be at Villa are. So, they haven't scored a goal yet this season in the league. They haven't or in any competition because they've only played league games. They've their goalkeeper wasn't in the squad. So we had the manager just repeating the name of the reserve goalkeeper who was starting over and over and over again and turning him into the weekend's protagonist. >> We had a bench >> sorry I was sorry I'm just going to interrupt you Daniel at that point we'll for the podcast version we'll actually play that in >> so I I'll just introduce that. It was quite bizarre. This was ahead of the game in which uh in an interview in which he's asked why no Emmy Martinez and this is how he replied and we should point out that extraordinary and but he's done this kind of thing before. There was a moment at the end of last season when Villa just won at Bournemouth and confirmed their place in some European competition and and the postgame press conference went like this. Unai Emory everybody. Sorry Daniel, you were saying first of all there was uh what was your first point again? >> So I mean first of all they haven't scored a goal yet this season >> in the league. Um secondly yeah there's that bizarre Martinez stuff. I mean I know we've had players not being available and pulling out and it's been a mad summer for that as I've already ranted about once and won't do again. But with Emmy Martin is I mean I've heard some you know there's been some reports of vague Manchester United interests but >> he I mean it doesn't seem enough that you could just pull out the squad so that's obviously bizarre. Emory himself being like that you know was a kind of red flag to me in terms of where his head's at. The bench looked extraordinarily weak. Um, I don't know how many Premier League clubs this weekend had a stronger bell bench than Villas, but I bet it's more than half of the league and they've got Europa League football this season. And it sounds like because of the squad controls that UEFA are imposing after the last two years that Villa are then, you know, in a position where they can't really spend an awful lot of money. >> You know, they were linked heavily with Pakitar and now he's done his kind of NSync star celebration. So, we know that deal's off. And yeah, I just it does feel like it's amazing to me how quickly these things can feel like they're beginning to unravel >> because Villa have been a positive story only for the last two years. And now, yeah, it's quite hard to see where the goals are coming from because there's no obvious creativity there. Morgan Rogers is I don't know if he's dropped form's dropped off a cliff or he's just being double marked because there's nobody else. But they don't really you they could have played for they could have played three games tonight and not look like scoring >> in sync though. Great shout. Emmy Martinez possibly going to Man United. Victor Lindelof apparently heading to Villa Park. That's one uh reinforcement coming in as is a 17-year-old from Abedine JJ by the name of Fletcher Boyd. >> Fletcher Boyd. Yeah. So he's not really managed to get into the team much the last little while but um he's a very tidy young player. He's like an attacking midfielder. Um I don't know if he'd be ready for um the Premier League straight away because he was trying to force his way into the Aberdine team, but uh he said recently that um he uh used to get really nervous before games, but now he feels excited. So he's got past that bit. So that's a good bit. Obviously he's growing into it. Um but he's his a specialty is going to say is poncho. I don't know what that means, but it came to be. What does that mean? Poncho. >> Poncho means Yeah, that's something he likes to do. >> Well, his poncho is that he likes to shoot from distance and >> he can do that pretty well. You can couple of goals you can see him well one goal you can see him score in the Scottish Premiership and and is I read one of these at club program interviews with him and he says that his first memory of football he's asked and he said was I think lobbing the keeper from the halfway line but him doing it at under 10. That was his first first memory. >> Wow. >> of football. >> What am I doing here? He must have thought. >> Yeah. >> Extraordinary. Abedine by the way how's their season going? >> No. Uh it's it's it's on it's underway. >> Okay. bottom of the table. >> Yes. >> Have you scored a goal yet? >> Uh not in Scotland. Well, not in the Premiership, but uh in the Conference League because managed to lose Europa League uh playoff final. Okay. >> Playoff final. We'll just playoff. >> Yeah. So yeah, in the conference league that should be good, but um not going particularly well after all the you'll remember last season got talked about a lot because they did such a good se start the season, but I think they haven't they've only won something like five and 30 or some some mad statistic like that. >> Uh basically the it's very much not going very well for the manager. >> Okay. >> And so it'll be interesting to see what happens in the next little while. >> Yeah. Okay. common story in uh in Scotland, of course. All right, very good. Uh next up, uh should we get on to Saturday's action? Saturday's action. Quick shout out to the one team in the entire football league with a 100% winning record this season. You know who that is, Tim? >> I don't know. >> Middlesbrough. Top of the Championship, four games played, four wins. Now under the tutelage of the former Luton boss Rob Edwards. >> Yeah, I was I was at the Riverside on Saturday lunchtime to beat Sheffield United 1 nil. Uh Sheffield United who are the >> crisis club I suppose of the year. Well >> crisis club owner shenanigans notwithstanding on pitch crisis club Sheffield United. uh they were routinely terrible and Middlesborough were not particularly good but yeah they're flying under Rob Edwards and I'm really pleased for him. I interviewed him last season when he was at Luton. He was kind of really happy to be back in the Championship and hoping to take Luton back to the Premier League and it all kind of deescalated and yeah, it was a pretty rotten season for him. Uh so I'm really glad to see him back and doing well. >> All right, four wins out of four for him. Four defeats out of four for Sheffield United under their manager Ruben Cers. You remember him at Saints? Yeah. Anyway, Rotten for Sheffield United bottom of the table with no points whatsoever. Tim uh Wolves. >> Yeah, >> just give us one to JJ. >> Uh Wolves were involved in one of the most exciting games of the weekend. There were a couple of 3-2 victories on Saturday. Man United at home to Burnley, but Everton away to Wolves. And Everton look, I mean, sexy. David Moyes knows what he's doing. He he gets like good characters in. He gets uh center backs know how to defend. He makes them organized out of possession. Doesn't do too much. He also lets them play. He lets players play. So, you get to see them actually enjoy themselves. You've got Greish being allowed to play. You got J Hall playing positions where he should be actually getting in game. I love Injai. I think he's so much fun to watch. And um and then you got Betto up top there. They signed Tier Barry who I think's done okay so far as well. But those three um in front of uh what I'd say just just a good solid Premier League midfield two of Garner and Gay is all right. That's kind of okay. And they're very much a team that could and should finish around about 13th. But considering what it looked like a while ago and how bad things look to be going like so many players leaving and everything, they're just okay with that. And then Tyler Dibling's coming as well. looks like and another player love watching him as well. So they've got good players he can come in and out with. And >> and when Gridge came in, everyone was saying, well, wouldn't it be great if he was back to something like his form for Villa and I don't know if you would you would call it that, but he's had four assists in two starts. That's crazy. >> Yeah. And just like picking up the ball on your Daniel, sorry, >> I was going to say so it made me kind of warmed to my heart hearing David Moyes talk about him after the game and he just he was asked a question. He sort of thought for a moment and said, "Yeah, the the mad thing is he's better than I thought." And I thought, "It's quite good that like David Moyes, this sort of wizarded old head of the Premier League, can just get a player in Greish and be surprised by his quality having watched, you know, we've all seen so much of Greish, but and then Greish put a post on social media about, you know, just saying like, I'm really loving football again and this is the good stuff, right? I mean, I'm jealous that Everton got him, but he is." >> Yeah. when he when he wants it and when his head's in the right place, he's obviously absolutely magnificent. And I agree with JJ like just having him die, not having to do like sing the theme tune, write the theme tune, do everything himself is such a massive advantage to Everton because he's got all the quality, but if they can kind of refine it so he doesn't have to do everything, he's a star. >> Okay, Tim, are you still staying out of this or you? >> No, no, no, no. Um just uh you talking about Greish there reminded me of of a tweet I saw earlier which really made me laugh of a picture with uh Greish uh sort of hugging the away end at full time and like really you know really nice scenes and someone said uh this is like the before and after uh that you get in an RSPCA or a dogs trust advert kind of sums it up quite nicely really. >> Yeah. Right. Indeed. Not dogs but wolves. Uh Tim Wolves who are bottom of the table. Uh the only team worse than Aston Villa. So there's an interesting kind of West Midlands derby going on at the foot of the Premier League. No points from three games so far under Vid Pereira. Jorgen Strand Last. You going to lose him to Newcastle? >> I'm I'm not feeling very confident. I mean didn't he has been carrying a knock, but the fact he didn't play in this game is not a good sign. Um yeah, it's turning pretty toxic at Molyneu. The the the chant was back the team or sell the club. Very much aimed at the owners. You know, Vital Pereira is not not in any danger certainly from the fans anyway. You know, did a good job last season, but was basically, you know, sleepwalking towards relegation. I think >> we're only in August. >> No, but I'm really concerned about the recruitment. You know, they've you look at their team last year wasn't great, but you know, there were there were sort of about five or six good players who've all gone. So Kuna's gone, Atori is gone, Smido's gone, Strand Larson no longer in the team. And Agadu, who was a bit of a phenomenon in the second half season, his form has completely gone off a cliff. He looks like a different player. So that's sort of half the team gone and replaced by really inferior replacements. You know, they've really struggled with recruitment this summer. A lot of players turn them down. They're sort of down to second, third, fourth, fifth choices in the players that they bought. Um so the basically I feel pretty confident saying that the team is a lot worse than last season. Um and I was was confident that there was a safety net in the form of three promoted teams just judging on what's happened in the last two seasons. Um but it doesn't look to be the case. You know I think they've got 13 points between them the promoted teams already. So that does really concern me and it concerns me that Strand Larson wants to go which, you know, we talk, okay, he's behaved, you know, fine, whatever, came on a score two midweek, but he only joined the club two months ago, right? He signed for Wolves in June and now he's asking the chairman to leave, >> right? And okay, apparently he's done it in a very nice way and maybe he's not going to keep a fuss, but that is not a great sign. I understand completely why he would want to go to one of the biggest clubs in England. Um, so yeah, I'm I'm concerned about that. I'm concerned that Wolves will see what is an incredible profit in two months of buying him for 23 million and selling him for 65 and sell him and obviously with a replacement before the end of Monday. But um I don't know how they can do that. I don't think how don't see how they can bring in a replacement who can guarantee Premier League goals. So, um, but even if he'd played on Saturday, I don't think he would have changed the score line. So, it's all pretty depressing. >> Okay. >> Maybe West Ham could sell Callum Wilson. >> Yeah. Yeah. I'll take >> everyone wins. >> Very nice. Wolampton W is currently bottom of the table. Villa in 19th and Fulham in 18th. So, none of the promoted sides in the bottom three, although we are only three games into the season. So, no picking at the table. Sorry for that. Burnley, one of those promoted sides were beaten 32. Old Trafford on Saturday, one of the 3:00 games. Ruben Amarim, who'd had such a terrible time of it with his Man United side away at Grimby or at least in Cleorps against Grimby on Wednesday, he needed a response. Did this constitute one for you, Daniel? >> Uh, they were really, really good first half. Um they were as good that if they'd have played like that midweek they'd have been three or four up at Halime and they could have been three or four up at halftime against Burnley. Um the second half collapse is obviously pretty worrying. The fact that Alai Bayinder spilled a shot to keep up this record of kind of which Manchester United goalkeeper is going to be at fault for a goal this week competition is bad. Um I did also think that Bernie were really really good second half. I know we kind of have to view everything through the prison of United, but I thought that Josh Cullen and Leslie Aguchuk in midfield as the combination. I thought they were really really good at getting around the pitch at breaking up play and one of them driving forward and the other one passing, but they are not of a level that Manchester United should be at. And the problem is is that central midfielders tend to find, you know, that they are able to make hay against Manchester United's midfield. And that problem hasn't gone away and nor is the goalkeeper problem. They may sign a goalkeeper, I guess. It sounds like on deadline day, but uh no, the problems haven't gone away. It was kind of funny hearing Amarine after the match. Like it's one victory against Burnley is not going to make that man smile. It's fair to say. >> Uh four of his eight Premier League wins have come against promoted sides. Next up though, they are playing Manchester City as mentioned before and as indeed we referenced then Amarim did actually win that game last season. Matias Kuna may not be featuring in that having done something to his hamstring. He was one of the players and Bemo and and Kuna coming in that we mentioned wildly outperformed their xG last season and wellbe still being really affected. Kuna shows signs of maybe regressing a little bit to the to the mean. >> Well, that's I mean that's normal. That's kind of how XG works, right? Is you normally have a you tend to revert to it. If you're really good, you can keep up kind of level and eventually go over again. But yeah, that's kind of the mean. Yeah. >> Yeah, exactly. But then you've got um I mean I think United have undersshot their expected goals this this uh season already. >> Okay. So they should be >> it's well they have been overdue that now for I think about like seven seasons or something like that. Not that they've been under the shooting net for that long, but I mean the whole point is you bring in great players to improve your attack and they do. In fact, one there was one movement early in this game where the ball got pinged all the way across the pitch and Bumo with one touch takes it like kills it and pushes it away from the defenders take a shot. And you can just see like even if the system's not working, you've got all these amazing individuals who can maybe open up a game for them and get them out of trouble. Uh which is not ideal still, but they do have that now. >> Okay. And they're up in ninth place in the top half of the table. Very nice. We should talk about what happened at Tottenham with the brilliant performance from Bournemouth. We should certainly talk about Chelsea against uh Fulham and to an extent we should talk about leads Newcastle but to a lesser extent. But anyway, we'll do all of that next. Big news at Tottenham Hotspur. Last week, the club confirming the signing of Javi Simmons from RB Leipig and then on Saturday demonstrating exactly why they need him with an remarkable performance against Bournemouth. Daniel, first off, Bournemouth were so good in this game and we mentioned Dar Uriola being out of contract at the end of the season, but the performance that he's got out of the a team that had lost so many of its of his first choice players from last season is remarkable. It was a performance that was so good and so dominant that on the back of watching it back, I basically decided that I think Bournemouth can finish in the top six this season because they don't have European football of which nine other clubs do. They're already out of the League Cup because they lost at home to Brenford and to say they lost three of their four central defenders and have changed goalkeeper. the ability to protect them with their high press and cause turnovers and problems. So it doesn't matter is already looks as good if not better than last season. They will concede more goals than last season because the quality of indiv individual defender is not as good but they just look such a composed team for one that lost so many individual parts this summer. They limited to Spurs to I think 0.17 xG in the entire game. But the point is is that they limited Spurs to no shots in the first 50 minutes. And in that time they had created enough chances, enough big chances to have won two or three games. It was the most dominant performance you can imagine by uh a a supposed non- elite team against a supposed big six team. It was just phenomenal. They are everybody did their job perfectly and these are not big money signings. Iola can have any job he wants next summer if Bournemouth keep playing like this. >> Well, the job that he didn't want this summer was Spurs because I think because he wanted to honor his contract down on the South Coast, his team leading the shot count at Halime in this game 10 to zero, which is pretty remarkable stuff, especially against a Spurs team who've been earning plaudits for their performances thus far. comments on the on the athletic from Spurs fans. Matt C saying they played like a bunch of guys who heard how great they were for a week after beating City away. Fictitious Jay answering that by pointing out that Spurs have failed to win the corresponding fixture after beating Man City for nine consecutive in nine for the ninth sorry for nine consecutive matches. And they've also got a horrendous pre- international break run which I think is also nine matches I'm sure I heard yesterday that they haven't won before an international break which is weird. So if you combine those two there was absolutely no chance of winning. >> Well Jay Harris also points out that not only those numbers were pointing to something like this happening against Bournemouth. He uh reminds us that in preseason Spurs basically got all their goals or the majority of their goals from set pieces because of that lack of creativity which is why they brought in Chavy Simmons and it was that lack of creativity that made that really set Bournemouth up to dominate them the way that they did. >> Yeah. And and the early goal which I don't think helped. Um but yeah, obviously that's a position they've been looking to fill all summer. Gibbs White Esa thought they had both through the door. Madison obviously injured as well. Kulleski is out till January I think. So there is a lot of there is a der of creativity there. >> Um Chavy Sivens I think is a fantastic addition but not necessarily going to come and hit the ground running. You know he's had a sort of unusual career history and his his end product was certainly there last season at RB Lifick but you know they need to find his role in the team and then and then work the attack around him. I think I think he's that kind of player. Um but this was alarmingly bad. Daniel mentions XG 0.17. It's their lowest for four years since they lost 3-0 to Palace under Nuno. Um it's just so hard to explain really. They've looked so defensively disciplined um in the last couple of weeks, but they look completely open to continuous counterattacks here from Bournemouth. Um and the whole attack just had a massive off day, but I don't know how you explain that from, you know, two really good competent or three if you count the Super Cup performances to go into five shots from 61% possession, you know, but I guess there was no one to unlock the door. But then you can't say well Chavy Simmons is going to come in and we desperately need him >> right >> I don't know you look at the team it is a bit onedimensional and you know Curtis is the only sort of >> creative spark is really going to do something on on his own in that attack so um concerning but obviously they're they're a massive work work in progress >> right and a manager who's only just arrived some people would describe Shavi Simmons as their biggest signing since Christian Erikson or potentially the most exciting Daniel you have a view on that or JJ >> Yeah I think I think Yeah, let JJ go. >> Um, well, that's uh >> You're underwhelmed, aren't you, JJ? >> I was looking at something else while you're doing that. >> All right. Okay. >> Are you wellemed? >> I am TBC. I think what they do need to do is I think how him and Muhammad Kudu's work together is going to be really interesting. Zavi Seaman strikes me as a guy who wants to get the ball in space and do things quickly. And one of the reasons I think they struggled on Saturday is because Mohamed Cudis didn't seem content with beating one player but tries to beat another and then loses the ball or um he he touched the ball like I think 45 times and only made something like 15 complete passes or something. So it's almost like he just needs to do the simple thing really well and I think because they lack the creativity at the moment he's feeling like he needs to do everything. Like we said about Illan and die actually the hope is that Javi Simmons can be the Greish that means that no one person has to do everything but you have to find a way of that working in tandem and Cudis has to get on board with that and Simmons has to acclimatize. Um TBC I don't know he he's always a player he's one of those players that Seammens that barring the game against England at the Euros always seems to play well in games I don't watch uh and done not well in the games I do. Okay, I've got a stat for you courtesy of producer Charlie. In the last two seasons in the Bundesliga, there were only two players with 100 shots, 100 chances created, and 100 successful dribbles. Those two players were Florian Vertz and Shavy Simmons. Mind you, Floren Vertz hasn't exactly lift things up so far. Philip, anyway, early doors and all sorts of reasons to be optimistic. Now, Chelsea played Fulham on Saturday and they beat them 2-0. But that really wasn't the story. While the game was still goalless, young Josh King scored a fine fine goal that I think everybody, Chelsea players, Fulham players, everyone at the stadium was perplexed to see called back by VAR for essentially what an unpaid parking ticket or something. It was a No, it was a moment in midfield. Tim, do you want to take up the story? >> Well, yeah. Manise sort of does a pirouette to get away from Shalabar and just happens where he tries to put his foot on the floor as as happens when you know what goes up must come down and Shalabar's foot is there, >> right? It was a glorious little kind of zidan turn. >> Yeah. No, it was lovely. It was not a foul. I've not heard anyone say that this was a foul. It was just contact. But this is genuinely, you know, you hear about football going, "Oh, Daniel's making a face. He's not gonna he's not gonna do it. He's not gonna, is he?" >> I I I don't know. It's he's it's contact, but it's not it's not a foul. >> Daniel, >> I Yeah, I I I I don't think the goal should have been disallowed because I think that it was nowhere near a high enough bar for V to get involved and overturn the decision. So, I think that is true. If my player had his foot stepped on in the penalty area, uh I would want a penalty for my team because I think that I I know not every contact is a foul, but when they say not every contact is a foul, I think what they mean is like jostling, right? They don't mean standing on someone's foot. I've seen I don't know. I just feel like I've seen a lot of occasions where someone standing on someone's foot is given as a foul and the player goes, "Ow, that hurt my foot." And the referee gives a free kick. I feel like that's not that weird. And I think the context of the game maybe like non- big 16 taking the lead at home of big 16 maybe played slightly into this kind of >> ah disgrace but >> does it matter that Mun actually had the ball when he was executing the move and Chaloba is trying to take it off him and that's why his foot's in the wrong place. >> Well yeah because yeah that's part of it right because Talib is just there. I mean, I think a good way to look at it is if you're apply to five aside, if you're playing five aside and it happened against you, would you because there's no referee there, would you uh want to file for it? I think you'd probably go, "No, but it would hurt. So, therefore, you might just do it because it doesn't matter." But when you're on the elite leagues with a team of referees watching it, I don't think you can say that's a fail. Well, uh, the Premier League or Pog Maul felt that it was an incorrect decision by V to intervene to the extent that they removed the official in charge from acting on the Liverpool Arsenal game on Sunday evening. >> Yeah. And the Rob Jones in his, you know, what he said to the stadium, it was incorrect information. He he called it a careless challenge. Yeah. >> But it wasn't a challenge. He wasn't challenging anyone. He was just, he was looking the other way and putting his trying to put his foot on the floor. It's not. It was okay. You can maybe argue argue it was careless. >> It was shallow making the >> Yeah, but it was not a challenge by >> M. He was in full control of the ball. If it was on a video game, he would have still had the light above his head when he made the trick. So, it would be his ball. >> There you go. James Baker says, "Fulham fan here. Can the talk not just be about VA, please brackets, we feel robbed, etc. But what can you do?" And instead give a little time to the very fabulous Josh King. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. He's he's he's great. Um I watched him on on the opening day away Brighton and it wasn't his full debut. I think he started one game last season but he just slotted in and just looked so composed on the ball and constantly wanted the ball and uh very positive gets his head up and just drives with it and just was dovetailing beautifully with Uobi and has this real sort of confidence but elegance when he's on the ball and it's a big one for Fulham because they've lost quite a few um stars over the years. Um, uh, Fabio Cavalio springs to mind. They lost Cessnon the first time around. They lost Harvey Elliot. >> They lost. >> No, but like players have come through the academy. >> Um, Matt O'Reilly would be another one. Um, so time and again, you know, they they've obviously got a very good academy and bring talents through, but then they end up losing them. >> Um, and of course they bring bring in, you know, ready-made sort of 30-year-olds. That tends to be their thing. So Fulham fans ab absolutely love him already singing his name and um yeah he's got issues with needs to bulk up a bit and the physical side of the game can pass him by a bit but a huge talent already better than the last Josh King for me >> Daniel >> he he also he's also why I want to get the families and agents of teenage footballers and say like shake them and say you don't have to join a big like a big Premier League club a Chelsea or a Manchester Manchester City or Manchester United orever as soon as possible because he's also able to like grow slightly out of the limelight, right? So if Josh King is development is not going to be from what he is now to the best he's going to be in a in a straight line, but that's fine when you he's he's got a manager Marcus Silva who seems to completely understand how to develop players, young players, and he take him out when he needs to be taken out, give him a rest when he needs a rest. the whole team doesn't have to be carried on his shoulder because there's some massive demand of like we have to make Europe this season otherwise it's a disaster and it's just really nice to see good luck to him. Okay, that's actually like a that's quite a big problem they got in Scotland just now with a lot of players that come through because they can because the quality maybe uh depth you get in the Scottish Premiership players will break into the first team where they get games like that boy going to Aston Villa I think >> so you're more likely I think to become a player in Scotland actually get games and that will grow you more as a person and a footballer like Lewis Ferguson for example went to Aberdine and uh straight away into the first team got games if he'd gone somewhere like an academy when he was younger I very much doubt he'd have got to where he is now starring for Bologna. But the difference you get playing against, you know, professionals who are just their livelihood is going to make you a better player. I think like Lennon Miller is another good example and I think he's just moved to Italy as well. Um I can't remember which club it is. Yeah. Um like phenomenal player, right? So I if he'd gone through the academy system in England would easily have got, you know, gulped up by it and you just don't appear because there there's so many players who are just like you and you can't prove that you can compete on the professional level because you never get a chance to. Excellent. Well, well done and I hope he stays around at Craven Cottage and Chelsea won the game 2-0. Would it have turned out that way had Josh King's goal stood? We just don't know. But we can salute Jia Pedro for making it now five goals in five games. And remark on the fact that Alejandro Garnacho has moved from Man United's bomb squad to Chelsea's rather large squad. Does this make sense? Is this one of those random seeming Chelsea moves? gone out show. >> I think it makes there's a he's clearly incredibly talented and has a massive potential. Uh I think whatever the reasons that Man United didn't want to have him around are probably relevant to his future career and everything. I don't think it's just because of his offers on the pitch. Um but again sort of thing like is he going to break into that team? They just signed Gitons to play in the same side. So where does he go now? they have a better attack in theory for having them there and they've got him for a pretty decent price and Chelsea operate now as a sort of transfer business trading uh window and so you can just bring in players like that and like even if he doesn't play that much next year they can sell him for an extra 20 million what they got and they would get it for him. >> Okay. >> Uh also some breaking news Chelsea of recent agreements to recall their lone striker Mark Gee from Sunderland. >> Is that right? >> That's right. >> Oh my word. Well, Sunundland are up next as we round off today's show with a quick look at the Northeast teams. Sunland were two-1 winners against Brenford on Saturday. Same day saw Newcastle draw. No, actually, no. We going to start with JJ's song here, do you think? >> Would you want to play out with >> play out >> or start part with? >> Okay, >> that for our podcast listeners is the sound of the autumn. sound of JJ B with Why did Alexander Isac do me like that? Came from the heart that one, JJ. >> Uh yeah, I just I tried to embrace the emotion of what those Newcastle fans have been going through. It's very much like a real life breakup, you know? Yeah. >> How could you do that? How'd you do it like that? >> But got get let the emotion out. >> Well, you certainly did. And that's now out as a single. >> That's right. You can get it on Spotify and Apple Music and all the places that I don't know what they are. Or you can buy on vinyl. >> Not that one, but you can buy a record I've made on vinyl. >> Okay. >> You really can. >> And some people have, in fact, which I'm very grateful for and surprised by. >> I'm not surprised. >> No, I'm not. I I think it's uh excellent. That sounds so unconvincing. I'm going to have another go there. All right. YouTube. >> That's good. I want to cut that for myself. My own sizzle reel. >> Oh, really? Okay. Uh, right. It would be surprising if they hadn't, JJ. That's right. And now, oh, Newcastle have made an acquisition. Oh, have they? Have they made an acquisition? I've written this down, but I'm not sure if they have. We're at the wrong end of the show. >> Volmad. Yeah, they have signed. >> Oh, yeah. Of course they have. Thank you so much. Yeah. Now uh now up in the new keys uh up in the northeast Newcastle have made a signing Stokart's Nick Voldemard aka he who must not be named Corman many of our our eyes or many of our the eyes of many of us in the under21 Euros this summer where he was uh top scorer and also because he's really big 6'6 six. So, sounds like an exciting player and possibly filling in for another big striker that Newcastle have had who no longer turns out for them. Uh, we're talking about this because leads Newcastle this Saturday which did not feature Alexander Isac was of very little consequence. Is that right? Anything to report from that match? >> Nothing really. I tried to watch some of it back today to remember I was trying to work out if it really was as boring as I remember it being, but it kind of was. There some some of the highlights you get. you can see what they're trying to do in Newcastle. I think Newcastle maybe were the better team, but I think what you see with Newcastle is that uh this really intense way that Eddie how has them play. Um it that's going to be really hard to sustain all season long. But also, I mean, for the amount of money that they were supposed to have had when these owners came in, they ended up with a front two of Jacob Murphy and Will Oula, which is just not going to do it for me. And so, obviously, they need to bring in these players. Volto stands out because he stands out because he's looks he's he's massive. He's a massive boy, >> right? Um I have watched quite a lot of trying to work out if he's good or not and I cannot decide. Normally I can tell you straight away. >> Yes. >> I get a bit of the Xerxes about him. >> Oh. >> Because he's he's he dribbles really well. Technically very very good. He's got the strength. But just because you are big and can dribble doesn't mean you've got the speed and power to get away with it in the Premier League. So I uh it's a bit of a copout to say. I'll be interested to see what happens to him. I really can't tell. >> No. Okay. Daniel. >> Yeah. He strikes me as a potentially a kind of streaky striker that when things start going well, uh, he might go on a bit of a run, but I think, yeah, I think he's going to be pretty raw in the Premier League. There's there's always a, uh, I think the Bundesliga into the Premier League, they're sort of seen as the two most similar of the big five leagues. And yet, I actually think in terms of translating the skill sets, it's actually probably the hardest jump. Um there's something about particularly Bundesliga attackers I think you know freak Erling Harland notwithstanding uh where there is an acclimatization period and unless Newcastle get a new striker in tomorrow or there is some magic revitalization of the relationship with Alexander Ezak which I don't think there's going to be then he's I mean he's pretty much going to be starting every Newcastle game as a center forward unless Anthony Gordon does it and there are 50 more games potentially Newcastle season. It's a heck of an ask of a a guy who's really only had one successful domestic season, albeit he is absolutely massive and skillful. >> Right. >> Okay. And Newcastle with so many of these extra fixtures because of the Champions League, a Champions League draw which has given them some really intriguing matchups. their first one which sees them at home to Barcelona and their final one which on Wednesday the 28th of January will see them visit the park de France again where they had quite a famous and controversial match last time anyway. Uh finally then today Sunderland beat Brenford 2. That's six points from six now at the stadium of lights at least for the Black Cats. And Tim, you were talking about how it's worrying for the likes of Wolves how well the promoted sides are doing. Sunderland maybe with a slightly easier fixture list, but they are making hay while the sun shines. >> Uh yeah, they have a they have had a yeah a kind start West Ham, Burnley, and Brenford, but I I think you can't take anything away from the way they've started the season. I you it's so hard to tell how they're going to do when you look at a lot of their signings that came in that you know full disclosure I hadn't seen too many too much of them in action before. Um a lot of them have well barely played in their careers anyway sort of you know 20-year-old Dia Congo internationals etc. But yeah um they're already looking like they're going to give this a real go. I think they've done the best recruitment of the three promoted teams. I mean they had eight new players in their 11 on Saturday. Um they basically bought a new team. We have seen that not work in the past. I remember Burnley doing the same. Um but their midfield in particular looks really effective. You know, Diara from Strasborg, I think it's a record signing. Looks very dynamic. And you've got Sadiki is in the sort of engine room role and then Granny Jaca pulling the pulling the strings and just looking like he's you know belongs back in the Premier League again. But not only have they got a decent 11, they got good bench options. You know, Simon Dinger coming off the bench and Eidor scores the winner. So, it looks like their recruitment's been excellent. They haven't been sort of um too sort of I don't know pigheaded in their principles and sticking with only young players. They brought in some good experience players who played lot hundreds of games at the top level. So, yeah, they'll get hammered at some point, I'm sure. Um but they look like they're going to give themselves, you know, a real chance of staying up. >> Excellent. Brenford, their opponents in a chocolate kit, Daniel. Yeah, I mean it's not a nice kit, but I admire them trying something different. It's more outside the box. The thing that annoyed me about Brenford, thus ends terrible segue, um was that so they scored against Forest on the opening weekend, Thiago penalty. Thiago's taken 12 penalties in his career and scored 10 of them. They got a penalty against Sunderland to take the lead. Thiago's on the pitch and they give the penalty to Kevin Shardy who's never taken a penalty at senior football in regular match and he has it saved. And I think that to me just strikes as really poor planning or it's either a stupid decision that the players have taken or poor planning that Thiago is not the guaranteed taker. I didn't understand it at all. Like you don't always pay for those mistakes but Brenford clearly did >> right and paid the price because it was after that that Sunderland turned the game around from a goal down. Thiago had opened the scoring uh late on Enzo. Is it Enzo Lefay? Yeah, Enzo Lefay and then Isidor in the 96th minute. Anyway, wild scenes at the Stadium of Light and uh more where that came from very possibly, but not until after we've had an international break. On Thursday football show will return with a look ahead to the fixtures that await for our various nations. Who have England got Tim? >> Oh cri >> Daniel >> Andor and Serbia away. >> There you go. Wow. Ring Thursday in your diary then because we'll be breaking down Tomatukul's squad for those key fixtures and so much more. Loads of really interesting stuff from the international break. No doubt. But I think that brings us to the end of today's show. Of course, before Thursday, we got that Euro show that I mentioned way back at the start. Don't need to tell you about that again. For now, let me just say to you, Daniel, thank you so much for staying up late in Glasgow uh to give us the benefit of your wisdom. JJ, thank you so much for dropping in. Where can people find your music? >> Oh, it's on all the places, Spotify and Apple or YouTube or Instagram. Everywhere. I'm everywhere. >> JJ Bull, >> that's right. and Tim Spears whose output can be found at the athletic. Good. I'll be here on Tuesday with the Euro crew. Perhaps you'll join us for that. Shout out to Jake and Charlie in the booth and you listener. And now from all of us here, it's goodbye.
