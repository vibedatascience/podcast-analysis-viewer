You ready, Jimbo? Feel I could have used the time more productively. is flip side win big in the derby at turf more Scott Parker bus at Liverpool beat Burnley just at the Emirates Arsenal feeling zuba sonic at the GTech shard is a smooth operator and at the end of the day we're here to take stock of what did at all means on the Totally Football Show Sunday the 14th of September and live for some on YouTube and safely polished up on the podcast platform of your choice. For those in no hurry, it is the Totally Football Show today consisting of Duncan Alexander. >> Hello James. >> All right, Duncan. >> Also here Tom Williams. >> Hello James. >> Hello Tom. And Jay Harris. >> Hey James. Nice to see you, Jay. Tom's been in Paris this weekend, haven't you, Tom? >> I have. Was I rhyme with Jay's surname? >> It was >> so good. You don't even know you're doing it again. I mean, that is that those are the levels we're hitting. Accidental rhymes >> from the off. >> Indeed. So, >> yes, I was. >> Okay. To do the French match of the day, which is called >> Match of Ze, which started out as a highlights program. So it was very much the French version of match of Zday and then it became the vehicle for Canel Plus's coverage of live Premier League games but they liked the name so much that they kept it. >> Magnificent. What were you doing on it yesterday? >> I was doing my usual English football guy role. I was working alongside Olivia Dor, former Everton and Le United legend. Um, and yeah, watching all the games and trying to say insightful things about them >> in French. >> In French, >> what were the French most excited about? >> Um, >> they must have loved yesterday, right? Because there were hardly any goals, which is the sort of, you know, the trade break. They want a break from now. They rely on the Premier League for excitement. So, actually, they were bereft at the the lack of goal action. Um, yeah, I've enjoyed Arsenal's performance. I think, you know, most French people still have a bit of a >> a soft spot for Arsenal. Um, and yeah, and obviously finished off with a with the Chelsea game and the late drama at the GTech. >> Well, yeah, and Jay, you were there to see that. >> Yeah, I was. Um, pretty good performance from Brenford under Keith Andrews. I think that's quite a big uh moment for him. I know they went one nil up, but I think to score so late is is pretty big for him, >> right? I remember you before I think the season got too far underway saying that all those people predicting doom and gloom for the bees this season with their set piece coach wildly out of his depth with with everybody having left people were maybe being a little bit pessimistic and how right you've been proved if that performance was anything to go by. We'll hear more about that game very shortly. >> But Duncan, where were you this weekend? >> I was at home. I was working yesterday, but I was keeping a a roving eye across the whole of football. >> Thank goodness. >> Yeah. >> Did that include Wickham's trip to Petersburg? >> Sadly so. Yes. Yeah. Peter, who hadn't won all season, but now they have. So, what a kind club Wikim. Oh, >> deary me. Uh, results results from Premier League match day four. So Sunday saw the Manchester derby which featured two goals from Erling Holland and another from uh Phil Foden a three-nil victory as mass fans will agree against Manchester United. Earlier on the Sunday Burnley lost 1-0il to Liverpool in the 95th minute. Heartbreaking scenes for Scott Parker and co. Saturday Arsenal was 3-0 winners. Arsenal against Forest. That's the Gladiator opening sequence. Classico. Of course, it was also Angie's debut on the Forest bench, but the second straight game that Forest had lost 3-0 in. And there was a 3-0 win as well for Spurs against the side that beat Forest by that score line last time out, West Ham. Brenford held Chelsea to a 2-2 draw. Newcastle had a 1-0il win against bottom of the table Wallers, while Fulham moved out of the bottom three with their first win of the season, a one-nil victory over Leads. Elsewhere, Bournemouth beat Brighton 2-1 and there were goalless draws for Everton and Villa and Palace and Sunderland. We're going to begin at the Etihad. Uh coms Charlie is it do you think? >> Yeah. 3-0. >> All right. Quite the perform Oh, let me just quite the week for Erling Holland. Five goals for Norway against Muldova midweek and a couple here. Could have had at least one more in Man City's 3-0 victory over Man United. The goals, first of all, pretty special, Tom. Yeah, and in many ways playing Muldova is kind of ideal preparation for Manchester United because in terms of defensive robustness, there are similarities. Uh but yeah, no, I mean three really nice goals. Uh Jeremy Dou playing a key role in the first with that wriggle into the box. Cross gets blocked back to him, puts it back in and then Foden steers the header past Alaba Bayindi and then yeah, Harland a beautiful buildup to the second goal. Little nutmeg. Nico O'Reilly. Phil Foden with like a kind of elastico pass to Dou slips in Harland. Little dink. And then the third goal. I mean, absolute calamity. United cough up possession inside their own half. Harland is released. And you're thinking very briefly, can is there any if we run this simulation a million times, would Harry Magguire ever catch up with Elling Harland? I suspect the answer to that question is no. >> Yeah, the computer definitely says no. I also love goals where the the striker is basically looks offside but he's in his own half so it's just absolute school boy stuff. >> How good was City? How bad were United? >> Um I think I was really disappointed by um Agate. I think he was sort of culpable not just for um a couple of the goals but a couple of other chances that that City had. You know, Tom just mentioned the the nutmeg on from Nico O'Reilly and it's on Ugate and I just think you just don't need to dive in and where Nikico O'Reilly is right on the touch line. Just need to hold your ground and then it's completely out of position. Um I don't think we touched upon the chance where Harland goes round by Andy and hits the post. But that all comes from Agate's just woeful back pass and then Dictis is forced to to try and play a snap pass into midfield gets intercepted. City on the attack and then the Randers chance where he somehow chips the ball wide. When I was watching the replay, I just thought he started in midfield. You can see him making the run and just no one follows him. Um so just it's far too easy to play against man um Man United. The amount of time City just had so much space to run into is ridiculous. That said, they could have been back in the game had Gigi Don Rumor not pulled off a magnificent save on Brian Bremo at where the score line 2-0il would have made it interesting. >> I mean, it was just the most oh yeah, that's why they signed on a rumor thing I've ever seen. It was like, well, that's going in. Oh no, here's the man with the strongest wrists on the planet. And um it I've never seen a goalkeeper congratulated so much after a save as well. Every player came up to him was like, thank you. >> Roy must have been particularly furious about that. Um but yeah, I mean obviously people focused on Don's passing before the game, a couple of slightly shaky moments, but he didn't put anyone into trouble at any point. So yeah, a perfect debut. City only had 45% of possession. You know, they've been moving away from the old Guardiola model slowly but steadily. Playing with four center backs across the back was one indication of that. Signing Erling Harlem was another indication. I think signing Jan Luigi Donnarum is almost the biggest indication of all that. They're not going to bother trying to build up from the back as intricately as they could with Edison because Guardiola is just embracing the chaos. Um, and you know, United did create a decent amount of chances. You know, Donnaruma made that one great save and Brema was actually pretty lively for United. Got in good positions, but this is the new, you know, this is the new Man City. Um, and I think Donnaruma's arrival is is really kind of shows the extent to which Guardiola's thinking has shifted. get it long, hit Harland, let Foden feed off scraps. It sort of works. So I think to be fair to United, the front three were all right. Cesco, his first start in the Premier League and >> I thought, you know, he made a lot of runs a bit like Gawkarez in a couple of Arsenal early Arsenal games. He made a lot of runs and just wasn't seen and he kept like going past Las, you know, is anyone going to see me? But um >> he ran a bit. >> He ran a bit, but his his movement was good. And then Bremo, you know, had that chance that Don was saved, missed a couple late on, very much consolation territory, but he is, you know, a very good player as as Jay well knows. >> He's he's he's lively. And it was also the moment where um Dio sort of fakes the shot, crosses it, and Boomer's like three yards out of goals almost come at him so quickly and Donnaruma makes the save. But I think with >> a mirror chance as well, I think with Emba at least, he was always trying to do something. And there might have been times where he was shooting from too far out, but he was at least trying to give a little bit of impetus. >> Well, last season we saw Bruno Fernandez's kind of lone figure, desperately trying to keep the the the team a float, kind of the the the Jared Bowen figure at Old Trafford. I I wonder if that's going to be a little bit Ryan Bemo's uh role this season as well. Where are we at with the win stats now for Ruben Amarim? Um, so he has won six Premier League matches since he was appointed. >> Out of how many, Tom? >> Out of 31, I think, or something like that. >> And of the six teams he's beaten, four of them are no longer in the Premier, or four of those wins rather came against teams that are no longer in the Premier League. >> Just to add some further unhelpful context, I think one of United's big problems is they do not have a midfield. They have not figured out the midfield configuration. They bought lots of shiny new attackers, some of whom look really good. Um, you know, I think Dorgu looks a better fit at left wing back than some of the other players they've they've tried there. They've got good center backs, but they want to play a style of football that they're you know, Ruben Amarim's choice of center midfielders are not capable of playing it. Ugate being the prime example, but because they've now got um, you know, Abermo and Kuna when he's fit or DO today, Fernandez has to drop deeper. He can't play there. I thought Kobe Mayu did quite well when he came on given that you know he's been >> getting a bit of criticism from his own coach of late but I think that is you know that is the problem area. >> Okay so that's Man United but man City how good were they after their backto-back defeats a thumping for their their neighbors. >> Yeah well it's just I mean this is the kind of the roller coaster pattern with City isn't it since the the rot first set in about a year ago. They play really well like a sit back. Are we wrong to doubt them? and then they go and, you know, lose a game that they shouldn't have lost the very next week. So, I I think you need to judge them against better teams than United. >> They've beaten Wolves and United. All right, fair enough. They've lost to Brighton and Tottenham who look like better teams or better organized teams. >> Well, they have Napoli coming up on Thursday with Kevin De Bruyne returning to the Etihad. will be recording a special extra T football show on Friday actually to comment on that game and the other big game taking place in Thursday's Champions League face uh fixtures which is Newcastle Barcelona. One last stat on this game. This is the 57th Manchester derby in the Premier League. The first one not to see a yellow or red card. >> Now I'm not one to say the game was gone, but >> I imagine Roy Keane >> Yeah. would have something to say about that. All right. Anyone else want to outlast that? Duncan's last. >> He can't out. >> Okay. All right. Also on Sunday and somewhat less eventfully, Liverpool went to Turf Mall and had a very frustrating 94 and a half minutes until until a crazy handball from Hannibal saw all of Burnley's fine defensive work undone. Mo Salah stepped up. I'm not sure who's who saw Tom. Did you see this game? >> Yes. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> Heartbreaking for for Scott Parker. I famously he'd lost 9-0 in his his previous encounter while Bournemouth manager with with Liverpool. But I imagine that this one late goal must have hurt almost as much as those nine. >> Yeah, massively. And you know, Burnley have lost three of their four games so far this season and won the other one at home to Suddenland, but they've been quite unfortunate. They lost three-0 at Spurs on the opening day, but they weren't terrible. You know, >> they lost to United with a last minute >> and they lost to Manchester United and again, you know, you go back to that United game. They're 2-2 going going into stoppage time and Jayen Anthony tugs Amadial's shirt right on the edge of the box. literally the same patch of grass where Hannibal Medbury was standing this afternoon albeit in a different stadium when he inexplicably chose to lift his elbow above his head like that and floor you very significant turf floor. So you know they've been very close to getting creditable results against you know norbe quite a fee man United team and the defending champions. Do you think his manager would have given him a Hannibal lecture after >> entirely possible along with everyone else who was at Turf Moore because they defended pretty well you know prior to that Burnley I mean >> um you know it wasn't like Martin Dravka had the busiest afternoon of his life they were kind of keeping Liverpool at at arms length to an extent and the pressure was mounting and mounting and you kind of thought okay they've you know they've probably they've probably survived here but for the fourth game running Liverpool make the difference late on. Yeah, that was the 44th I think the 44th cross that Liverpool had put in which saw the the Hannibal Ham ball. >> Liverpool had 27 shots. Sounds good, but only four were on target. Um, obviously including the penalty. So, yeah, it looked, you know, Burnley went 541. It was very much not Vincent Company's Burnley, but it that's kind of what promoted teams should do, right, against the champions and yeah, they probably did deserve a point, but didn't get it. >> Wasn't all Hannibal's fault. There was also the red card about 10 minutes before the end. >> Leugu. Yeah. >> Right. >> A second yellow. The first one of which was a a crunching challenge on Mallister's ankle, I think. >> Yes. And he had to go off at Halime. >> Liverpool also subbed Kirk before Halime, which was a rare manager spotting that this player is probably going to get sent off. >> K has been a little bit uh a little bit too enthusiastic since he's joined Liverpool, hasn't he? >> Yeah. The yellow card there was for a um egregious bit of uh theatrics >> and some suggestions that on slot maybe gave him a a piece of his mind as he left the field as well. One hopes so >> he was booked for diving and then he gave away a foul just inside his own half as Bernie were counterattacking and there was little moment of like is he going to get sent off it and he wasn't and I think that's when Slot thought >> yeah need to get him off. So he he did you know he seemed to be explaining himself as Kirquez went off and he you know they seem to be on relatively good terms but he I think of all of I mean all of Liverpool's signings are still finding their feet and most the attention is on Hugo Kitake who started very well Florian Vvers who started quite slowly. I think Kirz has has struggled a little bit. I mean Madueki gave him a real chasing in the Arsenal game. >> Bournemouth did as well on the opening day. Yeah. So, >> so, >> well, one of them we haven't seen yet and that's Alexander Isac. >> Do think the reaction to him not being in the team was bit weird like everyone was like where is he? Why is he not like he didn't have a preseason like again? >> Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, >> the fact that he wasn't on the bench was perhaps >> what people were surprised about. >> Ease him in. >> I guess they just don't need to take any risk with him, >> right? and slots talking about potentially using him on Wednesday when they'll be taking on Atletico Madrid >> in the Champions League. Not at all. >> Sweden are underperforming in the world qualifying group, aren't they? So, their need to throw him on and see if he can do anything is a bit more pressing than Liverpool who've got 100% record. >> That's so true. Busy week, I was going to say, of Champions League, but Duncan. Yeah, I mean obviously fans of teams who aren't Liverpool and who think they might win the league were left dismayed at another late winner from Liverpool. But it occurred to me did when Liverpool won the league in 1990, the following season, 1999. That's how it works. Um they won their first eight league Yeah, they won their first eight league games that season. Everyone was like, "Well, they're clearly just going to do it again." I think they they had a record of 12 wins and two draws from their first 14. Um and then just fell away. So, I mean, you know, we've said this a few times already this season, but we're still it's still very very early and >> it's too early to draw a conclusion. >> Yeah. Yeah. I don't think any of their wins so far have been like the Mark of Champions. >> So, what do you draw from that as a conclusion? >> Well, they're too early to say. >> Yeah. >> Too early. >> Too early to say. >> Ultimately, Dun's lead. >> Ask me after Halloween. >> Put a little reminder in. >> Can I ask you about Arsenal's 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest? >> There you go. Uh for a start, should we temper our enthusiasm for this victory uh in light of the fact that West Ham beat Forest by the same score line last time out? >> Uh I don't think so. I think Arsenal were really impressive. They everything every flaw, if there were flaws that Arsenal had last season, um they kind of solved or had solved in this game. I think um you know the sight last season I think the sight of Saka and Cibbra on the sidelines would have been a real blow but I mean Madawke was brilliant all game. Um EZ really grew into the game particularly good in the second half. Garez scored again. Um you know Zubamey scored twice. He only scored twice all all season last year for Real Sad. So it >> they they were a bit more direct as well. second goal in particular, Cal Califuri knocked it on and Ete just did a brilliant first time cross or part, you know, lateral pass and then Gawk was just where you want a center forward to be and it just felt I think it felt like they've made progress, you know, like they they've now got other ways to score and other ways to win. I think that was the the big thing that cost them in the league last year. It was a beautiful goal from uh Zubamedi. The first, the second, a rare header from him, but the first I think takes a slight nick on its way in. >> I think it goes off Marillo's head. Fair play for even putting your head in the way of that shot to be honest. >> But you could see there was the camera angle behind Zubie Mendi. You could already see the trajectory of the ball. He'd already put an amount of swerve on it and it was I mean it's always annoying when you see a go a goal like that and then you realize it's been deflected. But I suspect I I think it would have gone in anyway. I think it was already >> swerving. >> Will Arteza continue to quietly amass the rail saucad team from 2020? >> It's working so far. The old Marino Zubendi Erdigard. >> Maybe that's why I didn't play on Sunday. >> Odigard going off though in this game and that was the the bad bit of news for us. >> Yeah. But also just to add to what Duncan was saying about Celiba and Saka being out, Declan Rice on the bench, Erdigard hobbling off early on. If that had happened last season, this is exactly the kind of game that Arsenal would have probably struggled in. And I think the goal that Jocker scored, that's exactly the kind of goal he's been uh signed to score and the kind of opposition he's been signed to score against. These are the kind of games Arsenal struggled in last season when they had all the possession and they had to break down, you know, a wellorganized defense. Their record in games against other big teams in recent years is really good. You know, they're able to get points in those games. it was these games that cost them last season and that's yeah just another sign that things appear to be moving in the right direction. >> I think we should um give a bit of credit to Mosca as well. So only his second appearance and um I think what has caught my eye is he's very good at just punching passes in between the lines very quickly. Um he's definitely a bit more confident than that than maybe you'd expect. Um so two games and he's he's performed pretty well. Obviously Duncan mentioned Maduke. That's probably quite a significant moment for him. >> Right. I've deleted all my old old social media posts saying why did Arsenal sign Meki and now I'm typing one out saying why did Chelsea sell him. >> Yeah, it's a really good question but I think he got a standing ovation at the Emirates and as like you alluded to there are a lot of Arsenal fans maybe foolishly signing petitions and saying that they didn't want to sign him in the summer. Um and obviously as Tom mentioned Madke played very well against Kirz at Anfield but that's a way. So for Mekke to have a performance like that in front of the Arsenal fans is probably a really really significant moment for him to sort of say I'm here I can kick on now and yeah why Chelsea got rid of him baffles me because as you mentioned I was at the GTE last night and they had Jamie Gittens and and a couple of other players and I wasn't that impressed by what they were doing. So it didn't make much sense to me. >> I mean the Chelsea model is to sign players and then sell them on. I mean whether you should sell them to one of your main rivals and improve them. >> Sometimes it works. >> I mean sometimes you loan them Sterling and you know it doesn't work as well but then you know that's why I didn't really get the Arsenal fans the ones that signed petitions in the summer like they saw with Havs that you know he left Chelsea with a not a stellar reputation at the end but has been a really important and valuable player. I mean you cannot judge players on well you can judge them on how they play at clubs. That's essentially what we do. But um >> but not until 10 games into the season. >> Well, exactly. But I think yeah, it's really good and like the Mui was so um he was going on his right foot a lot and you know in a way that Saka probably doesn't as much. I think Zack will always cut back on his left and yeah it was really impressive. >> Arsenal's backup right winger for um Saka last season was Raheem Sterling who was ineffective. obviously played Weri a lot who came on in this game and and was quite good and then Waneri got injured because he was playing too often because he was only 17 18 at the time. So I think Madek also probably relieves some of the pressure on Wii and Dalman to sort of be amazing week in week out. >> The Arsenal fans even sang his name yesterday which must be the the quickest turnaround from like petition against his signing graffiti telling the manager that he needs sacking to getting your own song. What what is the Meki song, Tom? >> It wasn't all that inventive, but it was about >> I think it was very player early on in a career at a club when you basically just go for one of the classic June. So, you know, >> yeah, >> or something like that. It was something like that. It's I'm sure they'll come up with a more, you know, inventive specific >> lot to work with >> in terms of syllables, rhymes, >> if you wanted to go more than an English folk route. He's got all five vows in his name which you got to respect. >> Spoiled for choice. >> As for anktoogloo, who had had I think one training session with Nottingham Forest prior to this match, it was suggested to him postgame that it will be a while before we'll see an ball at the city ground. No mate, it will not be weeks. It will be Wednesday. >> And when an makes a prediction, you best listen. >> This is quickly. This is what made me laugh when you said wellorganized defense. I was thinking how many times did I see Spurs have a wellorganized defense last year? Not many. >> The funny thing about Foster yesterday and you know him giving that response was you're like, "Oh, we're still doing this. We are still doing this." I mean, of course, he's not going to have changed since he left Tottenham, but the the desire to to be just slightly more prickly than the question, you know, necessarily invites you to be, that remains very much intact. They they could sorry they I wonder if they're they could be in serious trouble because Ola Ana picked up an injury on international duty first choice I think right back I can't remember I know he's versatile he can play both sides um Marino obviously went off with an ankle knock so obviously Spurs struggled last season when the injuries hit in and Postogloo couldn't rotate and already he's lost a key member of his starting 11 don't know how serious the Marillo knock is and you just think you know all it takes is one more and it's a slippery slope. >> They've got a trip to Swansea in the third round of the Carabal Cup on Wednesday. Arsenal meanwhile will be off in Bil Bao. A trip back to the Bass Country for Mikuel Artetta and indeed all the former Rail Saucy Dadabad boys. That's obviously in the Champions League. That's Tuesday, the early game. Uh we've got an early Tony Football Show European edition. That should be with you Tuesday morning looking ahead to that game. all the match day one fixtures. Liverpool against Atletico Madrid. It'll be big. Spurs against Varal. Chelsea make the trip to Bayern. >> Oo. Newcastle host Barcelona. And as previously mentioned, Man City have Napoli. Napoli who are top of the league in Sydia. A fine 3-1 win against Furantentina on Saturday night which saw Rasmos Hand come on and almost immediately score. the kind of goal that he could never score at Old Trafford. >> There's never been a better time to leave Manchester United and know that your career is immediately going to improve. >> The man he beat of course was de hair on a similar note earlier that day should mention an absolutely extraordinary debt between >> Juventus and in we'll be diving into that uh on Tuesday morning with James Horncastle Lloyd Kelly opening the scoring of what was a sevengoal thriller. some very very special seven goals only eight shots on target by the way >> and both two round brothers on the score sheet >> curiously only one of them celebrated which I was taken about by so Marcus Tram didn't celebrate Ephraim Tran did >> do the little I thought they copy he did point to his >> but he very kind of visibly didn't celebrate beyond just signaling his name his dad was there in a rather smart hat watching on and I wasn't sure if possibly it was kind of out of respect for his dad's Juventus heritage, but it seems a bit strange to take the non-ceelebration not just to your own back catalog, but your your father's. >> Just when you thought non celebrations couldn't get any worse, there's a whole other Pandora's box. It's just >> there's probably a very very good reason when you need him. >> Well, exactly. >> Did we see the picture of uh the ref cam shot of him looking at the TM brothers? It's very good. It they just look non plus but it's quite rare a rare it's a rare benefit of the new ref cam era I'd say or >> Duncan's not there for ref cam Tom >> as in my team ref cam it's a stupid gimmick but every time it happens I'm like oh ref cam I'm going to avoid judgment at least for 10 games >> uh it just looks like something out of a video game it just sort of throws me off slightly >> I find it hard to take seriously and this is also when they give a player a a chestworn camera in the warm up when you see that their arms go in front. It looks like you're in a very >> beautiful early days. >> Early days. >> Chelsea heading to Munich to take on a Bayern team who have won all five of their matches so far with an average goal scored of four per game. Yikes. >> Might be their year in the Bundesliga this season. Might be getting ahead of myself, but >> got a good feeling about Bayern. We'll hear how Chelsea prepared for that trip next on the Totally Football Show. Woof. Quite the evening at the GTech on Saturday. Jay, you were there. >> Yes. >> So 22 between Brenford and Chelsea. The home side opened and closed the scoring. Mhm. >> I mentioned before this whole notion of a, you know, washed up Henderson pitching up there and Keith Andrews way out of his depth and all that, but early signs are that there might be something to this new look Brenford after all. >> Yeah, I was actually quite impressed. I think it made sense for Brenford to sign Henderson because Norard um moved to Arsenal. Um, but I've never really watched Henderson week in week out, especially in the last few years. don't really know what he was going to bring to this team apart from the classic leadership and and shouting a lot. Um but actually even when he's not on the ball, he's just constantly moving around. He's trying to, you know, offer a center back a passing option, a midfielder a passing option. You know, he's playing alongside Yamoyuk, who I think is only 20 years old. He's a very talented player, but you can just tell that he's going to grow and learn off Henderson. Um, and then I think Henderson's very front footed. He will always try and play a first time cross or whip something into the box. And his assist for Charlotte's goal was fantastic. And and I think arguably what's even better is that he nearly did the exact same thing 2 minutes before. So clearly already forging a connection with with some of these Brenford players. Um, there definitely was a point in last night's game where I felt that Henderson was sort of holding the hands of the other Brenford players saying, "Look, won the Champions League. I won this England international. just give me the ball and I'll try and make something happen. And to be fair to him, he did. >> Okay. Long throws. That was the other big news from the GTA. >> Yeah. I was a little bit confused why people were saying, "Oh, Brenford have done well from a long throw." And they basically scored the exact same goal when they beat Arsenal 2-0il on the opening day of the Premier League four seasons ago, whenever it was. Like Brenford are the the purveyors of long throws. Um it's just strange that it's Kevin Sharda, their center forward, who throw fro throws it in the box in the first place. Well, so the name was it Kob Kobe the >> Michael Kod sorry who had a monstrous throw in the first >> It's quite ridiculous. >> They've just clearly just got like you know a whole army of them just at the training ground. They're just training them week in week. >> Are they training them week in week out? You spend time there? >> I think so. I think what they normally do is like maybe on a Friday um dedicate half an hour at the end of a training session to to doing that type of stuff. But it's extremely effective and that's sort of I think the opening game of the season when Brenford lost to Nottingham Forest I was quite concerned by Keith Andrew's lineup. I thought it was a little bit naive if I'm honest the midfield he went for. This was a a bit of a classic Thomas Frank Brenford era display where it was a 352. Um you know they you had the big man and ego Thiago flicking on for Kevin Sharda. You know they attacked the space in behind Chelsea. They scored from a set piece. Um, and I think it was very pragmatic and it's what they needed to do and I think that was a big point for Keith Andrews. Um, you know, they've taken four points from Villa and Chelsea at home. Disappointing loss to Sunderland. So, I think for him that's something he can build on. >> Oh, it's very long. >> No, just on long throws. I mean, Mark Kerry did a piece before the weekend about them because obviously Thomas Tukul said last week, I'm going to use them for the World Cup. Everyone's like, what? But it's it's allowed. It's fine. >> And Thomas Tuker was there, so he would have been delighted. Well, but so this doesn't include the weekend just gone obviously, but um since the start of last season, Brenford had taken 121, which is almost double anyone else. And the team to take the fewest was Chelsea. So >> is that so? >> And the the funny thing is is that Chelsea set piece coach Bernardo Quaver spent many years working at Brenford. So if you'd think if anybody was going to still use him, it would be him. >> When did he leave? >> He left at the beginning of last season. So he's been with Chelsea for a year. >> Okay. and he's got them good at corners. So maybe maybe you know >> maybe on to throwins. >> Yeah, page seven he'll be on to throwins. >> Yeah, first year corners, second year throwins. >> I must say actually the Henderson assist was great in that goal was good. But seeing Keith Andrews a set piece specialist applauded an open play goal made me feel a bit uneasy. Didn't like it. >> His opposite number Enzo Moresca was his starting 11 with one eye on a trip to Munich. I think it was one eye on a trip to Munich and one eye on the fact that a lot of his key players done a lot of traveling during the international break. Um I think that was one of the reasons why Esteo was on the bench. Obviously Cole Palmer only just coming back from injury wasn't fit enough to start. Made an immediate impact when he when he came out. But they did it did feel like quite an experimental lineup. I mean, you know, they're already missing key players at the back, notably um Levi Colewill, and then you had what was it? Pedronetto, uh Fund Bonanate, Jamie Gittens in support of Xiao Pedro, who I'm not sure was necessarily signed to spend the whole season playing as the number nine, but is stepping in um in the absence of of Liam Dilap. And they did look like they were not entirely sure what they were doing and looked immediately a lot better as soon as Cole Palmer came on. Yeah, they were sorry they were up against a like I said earlier a back back three which is basically a back five for Brenford. So there a lot of times where if Jia Pedro got away from Ethan Pinnick then Nathan Collins had him then it would be Seth Vandenberg. One thing I noticed was that Eagle Thiago was um man marking Moyes as Kaisedo just seemed to be following him everywhere. I don't think he did it completely su successfully. I think he he got tired of chasing after him at times but he just sort of trying to prevent them playing through the middle of the park. Case who thought he'd won it for the Blues with that thunderous late strike, but in the end they had to share the points. Cozy Cuddles says, "Did we all overrate Chelsea on the back of them winning one big game in a glorified preseason friendly tournament, the Club World Cup?" Quite the game it was that they won, smashing the previously indestructible Paris Sanja man. But since then, asterisk, they didn't have a preseason, but since then, nil nil with Palace. They did get the big win against West Ham, but asterisk West Ham. They were pretty lucky against Fulham. And then this and they've got Bayern next. How worried >> should Moresca and Chelsea be? >> They got Manchester United next weekend in the Premier League. So, >> true on the Saturday. So, Bayern on the Wednesday, I think, >> and then Manchester United at Old Trafford. >> Yes. Yeah. And it wasn't just because of the Club World Cup that people were talking about Chelsea in a in a positive sense. They finished last season very strongly. They finished in the top four. They also won the Conference League. >> You know, Cole Palmer hit form again at the end of the season, which always makes a big difference. So, I think it's legitimate that people thought they were going to be, you know, competing for top four again. I don't think anything we've seen suggests that they're going to struggle to do that. Although Cole Palmer hitting form at the end of last season. What was the stat? When how long >> scored in since >> March, >> March, I think. >> You know, we've we've mentioned all their signings, but we should say that Jackson played a lot for them last season. Madek played a lot for them last season. I remember at one point maybe January, February, it felt like their starting front three was Jackson, Madek and Palmer, and two of them have gone. So, there's also going to be a an adaptation period as they bring all these new these new faces in. >> Nice bit of context, Jake. 10 games into the season, we'll know a little bit more. >> I can't just can't say at this early junction. >> I mean, I think they're the they're the best. If we accept Liverpool and Arsenal, probably the two strongest teams, I think, >> and Man City, >> you wouldn't have Man City in Nebraska level at the moment. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> As for Asterisk West Ham, they were facing Spurs on Saturday. Spurs, who brought a little bit of that Brenford setpiece magic along. Well, this is >> to North London with Thomas Frank. >> Yeah, I don't I don't I don't don't want to start on a negative for Spurs. My only worry for them is that they t at the moment they're just scoring a lot of setpiece goals under Thomas Frank. At some point they do need to score from open play. >> Do you think that's a legacy of their previous setpiece obsessed manager anod? >> Uh possibly. I I I think Tom, you know, I spent time in um Hong Kong and South Korea with um Spurs on tour and and some of the players were talking about I remember Ben Davies saying since Thomas Frank had come in, >> they' sort of identified lowhanging fruit that they could um just I guess take advantage of >> advantage of and I think set pieces is clearly one of them. Um I think what is maybe more important for Spurs yesterday is that Frank rested Benur um Richison and still got three points in a fantastic performance. You know there was no Dominic Saleni Kani started on the bench. Javi Simmons gets his debut. you know, mentioning Posoglu again, yes, he had a bad time with injuries, but there were also occasions he didn't rotate when he had the opportunity to. And I think Thomas Frank already has shown that he just seems to be a little bit more in tune with right, I'm going to give this player an opportunity instead. I'm going to tweak the lineup here. And it also feels like he's got a specific plan for every game, which >> he looks at each week and goes, "Oh, we play >> I'm gonna change a team like this cuz I think this will help us win the match." It's um could catch on, you know. >> But but then I completely agree with that. But then my only worry is that when you have a week at the start of the season to prepare for Man City away, >> when you've got a couple of days to prepare for Villa Royale in the Champions League and he's never had European experience before, it's a very different challenge. So yeah, I agree. >> He's had midweek carab, you know, he's had 46 games in a Championship. So I'm not completely putting that away, but but the Champions League is no doubt a step up. So, I'm I'll be intrigued to see if he still has such detailed plans when the the rest between games just is so much shorter. >> Although, Spurs do seem to have managed their way to a Europa League fixture list in the Champions League, so that'll help. >> Lucas Berg with a goal and an assist in this. Lovely header, a delicious assist. The hype is real, Jay. >> Yeah, Berg's a great player. Um, I actually met him in Sweden before he officially joined Spurs. got to spend time with him and I thought, okay, he's he's a good player. Um, he was I think he was only 18 at the time and he's playing in the Swedish top flight, but I thought, you know, going to needs a lot more development before he's going to be playing in the Premier League. And this time of year ago, I thought the exact same. So, we can see he's technically very good, but and then I don't know, something happened. Maybe he just bulked up in the gym and he just I guess settled into life in a in a different country, moving away from home, his parents, his brothers who are also professional footballers. And the second half of last season, he was just absolutely fantastic. And you know with Pellina coming in maybe he won't play as frequently as he did towards the second half of last season. >> Same role is it? I just think Frank has a lot of different options in midfield and he'll change it around a little bit and when you've got someone paling's experience and quality if he wants to play Bener Pinña and Simmons that's a conundrum for Frank to deal with but the worries that Berg and S might might lose minutes but I think Bergal's quality on the ball against teams like West Ham and Bournemouth for example just shows why those games like that he needs to start it's just so good >> right the look of pure delight on his face after each goal as well reminiscent of Dmitri and Dmitri finds out the early early nightclub based meme. Not sure if you recall that. Yeah, very similar. Very similar. >> Just quickly I should say so I think that's his second goal for Spurs and the first goal he scored for Spurs I've got it right was a Caraba Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool where he should have been sent off for a second yellow and he somehow got away with it and scores like 2 minutes later. Slot and Van Dyke were going absolutely nuts on the touch line. I think Slot's assistant got sent off. So at the end of that game, he just walked straight through the mixer and he didn't do any interviews because he knows he was only going to get asked about one thing. Should you have been on the pitch? So I think from his perspective last night was also like I can actually celebrate this goal and enjoy all that agilation. >> Nice. Nice. Spurs then with a three-0 win briefly West Ham. The woe continues. >> Yeah. Lot weren't many fans left by the end of the game. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. They weren't that bad first half. I felt like you they look you they looked like a teed up a bit of confidence in their previous fixture and I think I mean I think most West Ham fans were very underwhelmed by the lack of business they did in the transfer window but I think one area where they signed well was at fullback. Kyle Walker Peters is a proven Premier League operator and Alhaj Mal Elhaj Malik, you know, one of the star men in Sagal's win against England. He's got a beautiful left foot on him. Set up the Callum Wilson goal against Forest just before the break and they feel on the on the flanks at least there's a bit of thrust. >> Yeah, Summerville and Bowen are decent, but yeah, I mean they just can't defend corners and they gave away 13 against Spurs. So if you know which is the most in any game this season if if you know you're not very good at them sort of giving them away for starters and the Spurs were unlucky not to score >> in the first half but they did score and then >> it was overruled >> exactly >> harshly we should say that it was only 1 nil when So got sent off and obviously at that point it's going to be even more difficult >> but it could have been two >> but it it should have been two >> should have been 2 >> indeed asterisk should have been 2. >> Very good. We'll take a quick break there again after which we'll have some more news for you including Newcastle Wolves and Bournemouth Brighton and Fulham getting their first win of the season and other stuff too. Next week's totally extra as mentioned is going to be on Friday and very much concerned with events Thursday night in the Champions League. Last week's Totally Extra came out on Saturday and featured Duncan and Michael Cox and another famous MC Pedro Pinto's ball handler in chief >> button presser now to be fair. >> Is he a button presser? >> Well, it's the computer, isn't it? >> I haven't watched one. I watched the draw and um yeah, it was seeing Kaka just press a button like he was on every second counts was not not as good as the the ball era. I'd say >> nothing's as good as he used to be, including Joseph Mourinho's career. And that's actually partly the subject of uh of the affforementioned Saturday's Totally Extra. We're discussing the time when Moo really did wear miracles when he was in charge of Porto and won absolutely everything for two straight seasons, including the biggest thing of all. Very good. Check that out if you fancy it. Little bit of EFL news. Ruben Cers has been sacked as Sheffield United manager. Has that now been confirmed? Has now been confirmed? this after the 5-nil defeat at Ipsswitch which made it five defeats out of five this season for Ruben with the blades. The man who's apparently going to take over is surely not Chris Wilder for the third time who was himself dismissed for losing something only in his case it was the championship playoff final which sounds harsh. Uh believe the friction was based around the team's desire to use the club's desire to use AI in their transfer planning. Is that right, Duncan? >> Yeah, they, as a lot of EFL clubs have done recently, they've got new owners and they've sort of lent into a sort of data recruitment policy which um yeah, Chris Welder is not >> AI based. >> Yeah, that's that's overblown. It's basically >> is it kind of like Liverpool with their laptops and >> yeah, but Chris Wilder is very much not a data recruitment or AI man. I would suggest a man who gets angry if a fourth official is eating a sandwich possibly isn't an AI man. Don't know. >> But I mean the one thing you can say about AI is that it doesn't need to eat sandwiches. Maybe that's how it it could have been presented. >> Although sandwich does have the letters AI in it. >> There is that >> saying where you draw the line doesn't consume AI. Tom, >> you're saying from the planet's point of view, sandwich is about the only thing that it doesn't consume. >> Oh yes, indeed, James. Indeed. >> Dangerous times. Thursday, one of the games that we're going to be talking about in Friday's Totally Extra is Newcastle Barcelona, 28 years and one day after that famous Newcastle Barcelona with the Aspilia hattick and S Bobby and a 3-2 win for the Magpies. Woof. Do you want to one of those again on Thursday? >> Yeah. >> A hat trick. Absolutely. >> I mean, that would be a turn up. >> That would be a turn up. >> Yeah. >> It's not been the best of starts to the season for Newcastle, but they did get their first win this weekend in the league. 1 nil. It was a narrow one, and it was against bottom of the table Wolves. Did feature though a debut goal for Nick Voldemada. He'd only ever scored one headed goal in the Bundesliga. I found that extraordinary given how well he headed this one. >> Well, it was a weekend of great headers. His his header Berg Val Fodens was great including Pep on touch the classic manager helping in be the wrong. >> Can I just say I also scored a header in my Sunday league. Yeah. Yeah. >> When the lay wasn't going to save but you dragged it out of him dun when the lay lines collide >> as a score yourself Jay how good was what Voldemar did. >> Yeah it's really good. I think it's probably a little bit trickier than it looks on first glance because he sort of lead back off. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's a really good finish right into the corner. >> His hold up play was really good. So it was interesting to see what he would bring >> to Newcastle's attacking play. a different kind of player to Each with some kind of crossover skills, he's very good on the ball, good dribbler. Um, but something I that really stood out for me was the hold up play and very often, particularly with a kind of old school center forward, albeit, you know, he's a slightly more well-rounded player than that, but it can take time to develop a connection with the players around you, but he was, you know, popping off little onetwoss here and there, you know, little layoffs. Seemed to >> kind of slot in quite quite smoothly. The league's been crying out for a huge man with a good touch for a while. I mean, obviously had Peter Crouch, >> Tra. >> Yeah, Carol's Carol was more your classic, you know, powerful in the air sort of figure. Ian Orman droid for older listeners. Was that >> I quite liked Volto's interview on match of the day as well cuz he just said, "I was happy when I scored. I was just looking at the fans. They were smiling. I was happy." I don't know. It's just quite wholesome. You sometimes don't get Premier League players just be that normal. M >> he's only young. >> Yeah. Give it another year and he'll >> Yes. So, Barcelona on Thursday. Well, we we'll preview that game in Tuesday's European edition. Any particular thoughts? Believe that Barcelona may be absent. one one star in particular, Laminia Mahal, wasn't >> available for this Sunday's game, which hasn't quite happened yet as we record against Valencia, which they're having to play at their training ground cuz the builders didn't finish on time. >> Not like Barcelona find themselves at the mercy of administrative obstacles >> playing at your own training ground. I mean, so that is very tempo, isn't it? That is bad. >> I'm pretty certain they're not supposed to get away with it as well, right? But they've got special dispensation. How do you mean not supposed to get away with >> because because um I think there's a rule in La Liga. I'm just trying to remember what I read on the athletic the other day that the capacity has to be above a certain number and the training grounds substantially below that but >> 6,000. So you feel it's probably not going to make >> quite the uh quite the it's not going to be up to to form. Sorry, it's not going to be up to code. Very good. Well, we'll see how they fare at the rather larger St. James is on Thursday. >> Anything else you wanted to mention about Wolves? >> Oh, yeah, we should, shouldn't we? What do we want to say about them? >> Uh, they're not very good, >> right? >> And I mean, weirdly, they started this game really well and could have scored twice in the opening minute, but they're the >> once in the opening what was it 8 seconds. >> Yeah. I mean, that was encapsulated in my twice in the opening minute, but Yeah. Yeah. >> No, but I just I felt that you I felt there was even you could you could have gone more granular. >> Yeah. always go more granular, but yeah, they're the um >> uh they haven't got a point. They point >> um the worst starts to the Premier League season in terms of straight defeats is seven, which Palace did on in the Frank Debor season and Portsmouth did in one of their we're going to implode financially seasons. Well, Palace in the Frank Bur season are also evoked by another Premier League game this season which is Everton's nil nil draw with Aston Villa and another West Midland side struggling right now. I'm not sure which you you'd rather be Viller or Wolves. They're not that far apart in the league. I think Villa in penultimate spot are they not with West Ham currently rounding out the bottom three and Wolves are bottom. They are Let me get this stat right. Where is it? Where is They're the only team in the top seven, isn't it? Yet to score. >> So, Villa are the only team in the top seven tiers of English football. Not sure how many clubs that would be. >> A lot. >> 150 or so. >> More, I'd say. >> You don't know the answer to that. >> It's about 168. Thought you'd know that. I'm disappointed. I'm just >> The only one of those teams not to have scored a goal yet. M >> and what's particularly worrying about that is that all of their forward players >> are fit and available. They have got injuries in midfield, but Ollie Watkins is there. Morgan Rogers is there. >> All the other ones are there and they're just not not doing the business. And and you sort of had half an eye on this yesterday and Everton >> were the better team. >> Jack Greish for once not chipping in with a couple of assists, but it wasn't for want of trying. He created a a five chances. Five chances more than any other player on the pitch. Topy's had 20 shots. Only two were on target. But Jacob Tanwell or with the uh with the illumin the illustrative uh stat that Michael Keane on his own had a higher xG than Villa did. >> I mean you shouldn't I mean yeah is Yeah. >> Billy Mustard asked what has happened to Ollie Watkins? I I don't know. He looked all right for England the other night when he came on. M >> I think my my only guess can be that Villa have had quite a turbulent summer where they've been under restrictions as to what they can do in the transfer market had the whole Emmy Martinez debarkle um only made I don't want to call them panic buyers but maybe business they didn't expect to do at the end at the beginning of the window when they got Elliot and Jadden Sancho and sort of get the sense that everything's just a little bit muddled at the moment. They sort of need things to settle down um before things start heading again in the right direction. There's no doubt it's a squad that there's a lot of quality in there, but I think clearly the summer's just been a bit too hectic. >> Harvey Elliot coming in and taking the number nine shirt was not going to help matters cuz that is that is not on. >> Emmy Martinez also in the side for this game and perhaps a crucial return which saw them at least emerge from the Hill Dickinson with a point. Should we have a word on how amazing Bournemouth are? M >> 2-1 winners over Brighton. The Cherries who lost four of their back five in the summer took gave Liverpool a bit of a scare on opening day and have won three in a row since. >> Yeah. And on Benji's Uncle Jeff coefficient which we used in a white label form on the Athletic last week. Um >> just for anyone who's not familiar with Benji and his >> Yeah. It's basically you take the fixtures equival the same fixtures from the previous season. So you look at Bournemouth away at Anfield last season and you look at their other games, you look at them at home to Brighton last season, they lost. So basically they were already up five points on last year's fixtures going into this weekend. They've won this match which they lost last season. So they're plus eight now. So they are probably the most improved team in the Premier League. I would >> Who's the who's the most not improved team? >> Uh well going into this weekend it was um Aston Villa. >> The system works. >> Yeah. Don't tell Uncle Jeff cuz they want royalty. But this is >> What's a white label? >> Well, we Yeah. You mean >> it's just got other names? He didn't invent it. Benji needs to >> No, no, I know. We We were explaining about what that was and then I was thinking there'll be people who wondering what is a white label. >> White label is, you know, like as in a non-branded version of something, >> right? I think actually white label was DJs would >> would either uh well they would essentially put a white label over >> the uh the hot >> sounds they'd be dropping so that other rival DJs couldn't pick up on there. >> So essentially you've just kind of own branded it I guess >> or improved it asola has done to Bournemouth >> after all these uh after all these departures. Daniel Story has tipped them for a top six finish and that would sound pretty amazing. They did have an incredible run last year which during which it looked like they might end up with something similar. They fell away this time around. Does the fact that so many clubs are going to be in Europe and they're not. Does that give them an extra chance? >> It might help them out. I think they had quite a nasty um spell with injuries last season as well. I remember there was a shot where they've got like a little uh >> what's the word? You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, the box. There like 11 of them just sitting there. I do want to shout out um Alex Scott. Um obviously it's a fantastic finish. Um I saw Bournemouth when they beat Spurs a couple of weeks ago and I thought him and David Brooks in particular were just fantastic that day. so good and the ball very silky and I was thinking how long has Scott been at Bournemouth for because I remember when they signed him there was such a big thing about him being this really exciting English talent and I think I knew he was injured when he first joined Bournemouth didn't appreciate he was injured quite a lot last season as well with miniscus here so you sort of hope that if he can stay consistent and and play more than he did in the last couple of seasons then he'll just keep going from strength to strength it was only his second Premier League goal so is one of my favorite players to watch in the division for a reason whether he's playing off the left or the like a little bit of a naughty shove on um the koiper into the advertising hoardings, but I just think tomen's two-footedness, unpredictability, fantastic to watch. >> I mean, we wondered pre-season how all these departures were going to affect Bournemouth, losing almost their entire defense and their starting goalkeeper from last season. But their calling card as a team is their pressing. And at the risk of making a slightly basic sounding point, the players that do the pressing in a team are the forwards in the midfield. So the pressing unit has not been dismantled at all. And I think that's why they're able to play with something that resembles continuity with last season because the forward players be that Semenya, be that Evan Neielson, Maravia, they're still doing the same jobs and they've signed very good defenders who've come in, you know, and kind of slotted in um and taken the places of of the players who've left. But yeah, looking very good. >> Looks better than Kirk has. >> Looks very good. Yeah. Yeah. the only sort of um actually no you can scratch that because that doesn't make any sense. While while we're stopped, I should drop a line into the Villa chat cuz I said that uh Frank Debur's Crystal Palace and then I never explained why Villa. Well, indeed the connection with Frank Debur Crystal Palace, Unai Emory's side are the only u and indeed the connection with Crystal Palace and Frank Debur uh it's only the fifth time that a Premier League side has failed to score in their opening four games and the first time since Frank Debur at Sus Park. >> Can anyone name the three others? Go on then, Tom. Oh, >> actually, no, there's no point doing that. It's only because I looked up the stat weekend. >> Sheffield Wednesday 9394. >> Newcastle United 20056. >> Really? >> And Swansea City one season or other I think. So, I mean, yeah, >> one of the Swansea season teams. >> There you go. Thanks, Charlie. Use that as you will. Very good. You just finished saying something and then not saying it. Uh, which was >> I made I'd made a relatively coherent point about Bournemouth and I was about to add another point and I decided not to >> not to do so. Okay. Also on this match day four, Palace had a nil noil draw with Sunderland who got what they came for. You would probably sum that game up by saying and perhaps move on to the cartridges who got their first league win of the season in a one- nil victory over leads and it came in dramatic fashion. Jay, >> yeah, I mean um >> I I I feel for Goodmanson a little bit. >> What did he do, Jay? >> He just This was explained to me. I don't think he knew anything about >> this was explained to me before I saw the goal and I and so I was going in expecting nonsense and I I still didn't quite predict that. Um the corners come in. I think it's the 94th minute of the game and he basically falls backwards and heads it right into the the top corner of his own net. And and I think there's a Fulham player and Joe Rooden who I think jump immediately in front of him which clearly obscures his view because the way he hits his head and he falls backwards is almost as if he just had no idea what was about to happen. But it is like a scene out of I don't know Only Falls and horses or something like that. You've been framed. >> You'll often see a sideline reporter I say often you will sometimes see a sideline reporter hit on the head. There was a famous BT Sport example by some some well-lamed ball hoof at them during the warm-up and it very much reminded me of that. And yet in written coverage of a game, a goal like that is invar invariably described using one adjective and one adjective only. And that adjective is bizarre. A bizarre own goal. And in everyday parliament, you would you would >> save the word bizarre for something really weird. >> Yeah. like a a dog riding a bicycle down the street would be a bizarre sight in in like football parliament. Bizarre seems to be the go-to word for anything slightly unusual. You might also get calamitous, >> but you you get a lot more bizarre in football coverage than I think you should. >> Should say that Farer said and maybe he was just not exaggerating, but Farer said that Goodmanson was in tears in the um the dressing room afterwards because Yeah. Yeah. feel bad for him because I think leadeds have what scored one goal a penalty which was which was was in the opening game as well. So very much they're going to sort of have to rely on being defensively solid. They lost out on Buenote the final few days of the transfer window. So to come so close to to getting a point and to to throw it away in that fashion stings. >> So the 94th minute. Yeah. Hanning Fulham as I mentioned their first victory of the season. So well well done to them at least. Very good. It's a busy week ahead. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday with the Champions League. Proving it all is Totally Football Show European edition early on Tuesday. We'll have shows for you on Thursday morning. Thursday afternoon actually and Friday afternoon. No point in rushing it. And then yeah, we'll have another round of Premier League action. for now. Anything you want to add to that steaming pile of words, Tom? I >> think that's enough steaming words to be getting on with. >> Right. Okay. Many thanks to you for coming in and to you too, Duncan, and to Jay in the booth, Jake and producer Charlie. To you at home or wherever you might be, whether you're listening on the podcast or watching us via YouTube, many thanks for being part of it. Uh we'll look forward to speaking to you again soon. For now, from all of us here, it's goodbye.
