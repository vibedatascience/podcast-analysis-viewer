Give us a couple favorite moments. favorite moments. favorite moments. &gt;&gt; First of all, I think we should talk &gt;&gt; First of all, I think we should talk about the substance of the speech about the substance of the speech &gt;&gt; because I think this was the first &gt;&gt; because I think this was the first speech that President Trump has given on speech that President Trump has given on AI since the AI boom began. He's he's AI since the AI boom began. He's he's spoken about it before, but this was a spoken about it before, but this was a full-length policy speech and he full-length policy speech and he declared that the United States was in declared that the United States was in an AI race. It's a global competition. an AI race. It's a global competition. I think the the language that he used I think the the language that he used was reminiscent of how President John F. was reminiscent of how President John F. Kennedy declared that America was in a Kennedy declared that America was in a space race. And in a similar way, space race. And in a similar way, President Trump declared that we have to President Trump declared that we have to win the AI race. I think you can argue win the AI race. I think you can argue that the AI race is more important than that the AI race is more important than the space race. It's going to reshape the space race. It's going to reshape the global economy. It's going to the global economy. It's going to determine who the superpowers are of the determine who the superpowers are of the 21st century. And President Trump was 21st century. And President Trump was really clear that we had to win it and really clear that we had to win it and that he was going to support a strategy that he was going to support a strategy for winning it. And then he laid out for winning it. And then he laid out what some of those key pillars are. what some of those key pillars are. Number one was was innovation. We have Number one was was innovation. We have to get the red tape out of the way and to get the red tape out of the way and let our geniuses cook and clearly was let our geniuses cook and clearly was very supportive to a lot of the CEOs and very supportive to a lot of the CEOs and entrepreneurs in the crowd. Number two entrepreneurs in the crowd. Number two is infrastructure. He touted the is infrastructure. He touted the hundreds of billions of dollars of hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in energy and power investments in energy and power generation and grid upgrades and data generation and grid upgrades and data centers that he's supporting. And then centers that he's supporting. And then he also supported AI exports. He said he also supported AI exports. He said that we have to make America's tech that we have to make America's tech stack the global standard. So I think stack the global standard. So I think those were really important messages. those were really important messages. And then on top of that, I think there And then on top of that, I think there was also some parts of the speech that was also some parts of the speech that maybe have gotten less attention but are maybe have gotten less attention but are also important where he said that it's also important where he said that it's not only important that we win. He said not only important that we win. He said it's important how we win. And he sort it's important how we win. And he sort of mentioned three non-negotiables here. of mentioned three non-negotiables here.

And he also signed an executive order to And he also signed an executive order to prohibit woke AI in the federal prohibit woke AI in the federal government. We could talk about that in government. We could talk about that in a second. That probably was my favorite a second. That probably was my favorite moment. moment. moment. &gt;&gt; That was your favorite moment. &gt;&gt; That was your favorite moment. &gt;&gt; That was my favorite moment. &gt;&gt; That was my favorite moment. &gt;&gt; The red meat moment. I thought that was &gt;&gt; The red meat moment. I thought that was &gt;&gt; that was the red meat. Yeah. &gt;&gt; that was the red meat.

The third thing is he he did say that we do want to prevent our that we do want to prevent our technologies from being misused or technologies from being misused or stolen by malicious actors. And look, we stolen by malicious actors. And look, we we are going to monitor for emerging and we are going to monitor for emerging and unforeseen risk. So, you know, we're not unforeseen risk. So, you know, we're not going to disregard the risk. But he had going to disregard the risk. But he had this really good line in the speech this really good line in the speech about how even though AI, look, it's about how even though AI, look, it's it's a daunting technology because it's it's a daunting technology because it's so powerful and like any revolutionary so powerful and like any revolutionary technology like that, it can be used for technology like that, it can be used for bad as well as good. But the the bad as well as good. But the the daunting nature of it is all the more daunting nature of it is all the more reason why we have to do it in the reason why we have to do it in the United States. Why would the United United States. Why would the United States has to be the pioneer and the States has to be the pioneer and the leader is cuz we don't want the power of leader is cuz we don't want the power of that technology being developed in other that technology being developed in other parts of the world at least other parts parts of the world at least other parts of the world are going to have it but we of the world are going to have it but we want to be the ones on the cutting edge want to be the ones on the cutting edge who are defining it and leading it. who are defining it and leading it. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Okay. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Okay. &gt;&gt; So I think it was a really &gt;&gt; So I think it was a really important speech. I think this idea of important speech. I think this idea of an AI race that is similar to the space an AI race that is similar to the space race, I think is going to be the race, I think is going to be the dominant frame on AI policy for years to dominant frame on AI policy for years to come. come. come. &gt;&gt; Well, it's pretty clear, you know, this &gt;&gt; Well, it's pretty clear, you know, this presidency, this term is going to be presidency, this term is going to be earmarked, I think, by four key earmarked, I think, by four key initiatives. AI, crypto, immigration, initiatives. AI, crypto, immigration, and tariffs. I think that feels like and tariffs. I think that feels like what they're locking into as what's what they're locking into as what's important for the next three and a half important for the next three and a half years. I think you would agree with years. I think you would agree with that. And it's just great that you're that. And it's just great that you're spearheading and helping the president spearheading and helping the president with two of those four. And just I the with two of those four. And just I the velocity to me is what's super velocity to me is what's super impressive. Any way you could take us impressive. Any way you could take us behind the the scenes of how this stuff behind the the scenes of how this stuff is getting done so quickly. It feels is getting done so quickly. It feels like there's some operational like there's some operational cadence here that we didn't see in his cadence here that we didn't see in his first term. Certainly didn't see in the first term. Certainly didn't see in the Biden term, but there's a there's a Biden term, but there's a there's a cadence here that's different. Yeah. cadence here that's different. Yeah. Startup speed. H how is that? Startup speed. H how is that? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, we call it he's working at &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, we call it he's working at tech speed. I just think that the tech speed. I just think that the president's constantly working. I mean, president's constantly working. I mean, he's just so energetic. I mean, he he's just so energetic. I mean, he basically works like two full work days. basically works like two full work days. I think it's well known that he doesn't I think it's well known that he doesn't need a lot of sleep and he's continues need a lot of sleep and he's continues to work late into the night. And I just to work late into the night. And I just think his energy propels everything think his energy propels everything forward. I also think that there's a forward. I also think that there's a very cohesive team at the White House very cohesive team at the White House &gt;&gt; under the chief of staff, Susie Wilds. I &gt;&gt; under the chief of staff, Susie Wilds. I think it's very important. I think she think it's very important. I think she runs a tight ship and then you've got runs a tight ship and then you've got the deputy chief of staffs under her and the deputy chief of staffs under her and I think most of these people have been I think most of these people have been working together for a long time and working together for a long time and it's a team that works well together and it's a team that works well together and I just feels very coherent and cohesive I just feels very coherent and cohesive to me. to me. to me. &gt;&gt; So I think it's a very effective team. &gt;&gt; So I think it's a very effective team. &gt;&gt; It does feel like that. The pace is &gt;&gt; It does feel like that. The pace is great. It means you're going to get more great. It means you're going to get more shots on goal and you'll be able to try shots on goal and you'll be able to try more things and and get more more things and and get more accomplished just like we see in accomplished just like we see in startups. Chimamoth, outside of the startups. Chimamoth, outside of the president's talk, we'll go around the president's talk, we'll go around the horn here. Top two or three moments from horn here. Top two or three moments from the discussions, just lightning round the discussions, just lightning round here, rapid fire. What do you got? Top here, rapid fire. What do you got? Top two or three moments for you, Chamath, two or three moments for you, Chamath, just in the discussions that were just in the discussions that were enlightening to you, inspiring to you, enlightening to you, inspiring to you, notable to you. notable to you. &gt;&gt; I came out of it very motivated. I think &gt;&gt; I came out of it very motivated. I think that the combination of the speech, the that the combination of the speech, the executive orders, and the clarity of the executive orders, and the clarity of the big beautiful bill big beautiful bill now give those of us that are in these now give those of us that are in these markets a ton of runway to go and markets a ton of runway to go and execute. And so those things reinforced execute. And so those things reinforced by the various members of the cabinet I by the various members of the cabinet I think were very important. That was one. think were very important. That was one. And then the second thing were the And then the second thing were the market commentary from both Lisa Sue and market commentary from both Lisa Sue and Jensen I thought was really valuable. Jensen I thought was really valuable. &gt;&gt; And then the third was Chris Wright and &gt;&gt; And then the third was Chris Wright and Doug Bergam talking about energy. And I Doug Bergam talking about energy. And I tweeted this yesterday, but we are sort tweeted this yesterday, but we are sort of back to basics almost in a sense of back to basics almost in a sense where in the absence of power, I think where in the absence of power, I think AI is is not going to be the thing that AI is is not going to be the thing that we think it can be. So that's going to we think it can be. So that's going to create an enormous amount of appetite by create an enormous amount of appetite by the federal government to do deals and the federal government to do deals and get players on the field. That's to me get players on the field. That's to me very exciting. So very exciting. So &gt;&gt; yeah, I came away really &gt;&gt; yeah, I came away really riskon, I guess, is best way to say it. riskon, I guess, is best way to say it. &gt;&gt; I love it. Freebridge, you have two or &gt;&gt; I love it. Freebridge, you have two or three moments outside of the president's three moments outside of the president's speech. Obviously, that's the pinnacle speech. Obviously, that's the pinnacle there. So, let's just go below the there. So, let's just go below the pinnacle. What were the other two or pinnacle. What were the other two or three moments for you that were salient, three moments for you that were salient, inspiring, notable? inspiring, notable? inspiring, notable? &gt;&gt; I thought Jensen did a great job. I &gt;&gt; I thought Jensen did a great job. I don't know what you guys thought, but he don't know what you guys thought, but he is very compelling and has a incredible is very compelling and has a incredible uh vision and view on where AI is taking uh vision and view on where AI is taking us, where it's headed, and what the us, where it's headed, and what the challenges are. So, I really appreciated challenges are. So, I really appreciated him taking the time to come and join us. him taking the time to come and join us. last minute he rearranged his schedule last minute he rearranged his schedule to come out for it and it was great. By to come out for it and it was great. By the way, on the point on energy, which I the way, on the point on energy, which I still think is the biggest unsolved still think is the biggest unsolved issue right now in America besides the issue right now in America besides the uh the federal deficit and the debt uh the federal deficit and the debt problem, problem, problem, Chris Wright agreed to rearrange his Chris Wright agreed to rearrange his schedule to come and join us at the schedule to come and join us at the all-in summit in September. Oh, great. all-in summit in September. Oh, great. To continue the conversation. We didn't To continue the conversation. We didn't get enough time to talk about it. So, we get enough time to talk about it. So, we are going to hear more from Chris are going to hear more from Chris particularly with a particular focus, particularly with a particular focus, which is what I wanted to spend time on. which is what I wanted to spend time on. didn't get a chance last week on nuclear didn't get a chance last week on nuclear and where are we cuz he actually is very and where are we cuz he actually is very passionate like he said at the thing passionate like he said at the thing it's where he's spending most of his it's where he's spending most of his time right now and I think it's very time right now and I think it's very good to hear the deep dive on where we good to hear the deep dive on where we are in the cycle on trying to accelerate are in the cycle on trying to accelerate nuclear energy deployment in the United nuclear energy deployment in the United States same question to you after pus States same question to you after pus you got two or three moments that stood you got two or three moments that stood out out out &gt;&gt; let's just talk about the executive &gt;&gt; let's just talk about the executive orders for a second because I think it's orders for a second because I think it's pretty cool that the president of the pretty cool that the president of the United States signed three executive United States signed three executive orders at the all-in summit that we just orders at the all-in summit that we just hosted I And that was pretty amazing. hosted I And that was pretty amazing. One of them was to promote AI exports One of them was to promote AI exports because we want the American tech stack because we want the American tech stack to become the global standard. The to become the global standard. The second was around AI infrastructure to second was around AI infrastructure to make permitting easier so that we can make permitting easier so that we can help solve those energy problems you're help solve those energy problems you're talking about Freeberg. And then the talking about Freeberg. And then the third one was on preventing woke AI in third one was on preventing woke AI in the federal government. And that to me the federal government. And that to me is probably my personal favorite because is probably my personal favorite because we spent a couple years on the show we spent a couple years on the show talking about how when we're talking talking about how when we're talking about woke, you're really talking about about woke, you're really talking about censorship, right? We were talking about censorship, right? We were talking about censoring people's views based on censoring people's views based on ideological bias, ideological dogmas. We ideological bias, ideological dogmas. We saw what was happening saw what was happening &gt;&gt; in social media before Elon bought X &gt;&gt; in social media before Elon bought X that helped that helped that helped &gt;&gt; bring things back. But we were on a &gt;&gt; bring things back. But we were on a track, I think, before President Trump's track, I think, before President Trump's election to repeat that whole social election to repeat that whole social media censorship apparatus in the form media censorship apparatus in the form of AI bias or AI censorship. And we saw of AI bias or AI censorship. And we saw this with the whole black George this with the whole black George Washington and where some AI models were Washington and where some AI models were saying it was worse to misgender someone saying it was worse to misgender someone than to have a global thermonuclear war. than to have a global thermonuclear war. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And this wasn't an accident &gt;&gt; Yeah. And this wasn't an accident because if you go back to the Biden because if you go back to the Biden executive order on AI, there was executive order on AI, there was something like 20 pages of language on something like 20 pages of language on there encouraging DEI values to be there encouraging DEI values to be infused into AI models. infused into AI models. &gt;&gt; So again, we were on track to repeat all &gt;&gt; So again, we were on track to repeat all the social media censorship, all the the social media censorship, all the trust and safety stuff in this new world trust and safety stuff in this new world of AI, but it would have been even more of AI, but it would have been even more insidious because at least when someone insidious because at least when someone gets censored, you kind of find out gets censored, you kind of find out about it. about it. about it. &gt;&gt; It's explicit. It's not. &gt;&gt; It's explicit. It's not. &gt;&gt; It's explicit. But with AI, it would &gt;&gt; It's explicit. But with AI, it would have been worse because you wouldn't have been worse because you wouldn't have even known. It would just be there have even known. It would just be there rewriting history in real time to serve rewriting history in real time to serve a current political agenda. It would a current political agenda. It would have been brainwashing our kids. have been brainwashing our kids. &gt;&gt; Oh, and people trust these AIs more than &gt;&gt; Oh, and people trust these AIs more than they should. I mean, these things are they should. I mean, these things are making a prediction of the next word making a prediction of the next word coming. This is not like God-given truth coming. This is not like God-given truth here. And so, Freeberg, you wanted to here. And so, Freeberg, you wanted to interject about this one because this is interject about this one because this is actually I'll be honest, Saxs, I'm actually I'll be honest, Saxs, I'm surprised you're saying this was the surprised you're saying this was the most important one to you. I like that most important one to you. I like that you clarified it because it was the one you clarified it because it was the one that was mocked or kind of like people that was mocked or kind of like people were like what why is this important? I were like what why is this important? I think you made a good case for why it's think you made a good case for why it's important. Freeberg your response. Yeah, important. Freeberg your response. Yeah, but sex this is not about broadly making but sex this is not about broadly making quote AI non ideological. Private quote AI non ideological. Private companies should still have the right companies should still have the right through freedom of speech or freedom of through freedom of speech or freedom of expression or freedom to operate to make expression or freedom to operate to make AI that does whatever they want it to AI that does whatever they want it to do. What the EO was was that the federal do. What the EO was was that the federal government would not procure government would not procure ideologically biased AI. Is that ideologically biased AI. Is that correct? correct? correct? &gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. No, we're we're aware &gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. No, we're we're aware &gt;&gt; just to make sure that the the federal &gt;&gt; just to make sure that the the federal government is not trying to instruct government is not trying to instruct private companies how to operate. It's private companies how to operate. It's simply saying if you want to sell to us, simply saying if you want to sell to us, this these are the rules of the road. this these are the rules of the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true. So, we were very &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true. So, we were very careful about the First Amendment careful about the First Amendment issues. And you're right that if a issues. And you're right that if a private company wants to put out a private company wants to put out a biased AI product, we're not going to biased AI product, we're not going to tell people they can't use it. tell people they can't use it. &gt;&gt; And it could work. It could be &gt;&gt; And it could work. It could be successful. People might like it. Ya. successful. People might like it. Ya. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're just saying that the federal &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're just saying that the federal government is not going to spend government is not going to spend taxpayer money taxpayer money taxpayer money &gt;&gt; buying AI models that have compromised &gt;&gt; buying AI models that have compromised their accuracy and quality because their accuracy and quality because they're beholden to some, you know, they're beholden to some, you know, ideological agenda, ideological agenda, ideological agenda, &gt;&gt; which is similar to the approach with &gt;&gt; which is similar to the approach with the universities, right? Hey, listen, the universities, right? Hey, listen, you could have a biased university. you could have a biased university. We're just not going to fund it. We're We're just not going to fund it. We're not participating. I think it's it's not participating. I think it's it's quite reasonable in that way. And quite reasonable in that way. And &gt;&gt; yeah, and I would just say that, you &gt;&gt; yeah, and I would just say that, you know, we were a lot more careful about know, we were a lot more careful about this than the Biden administration was this than the Biden administration was when they required that DEI be inserted when they required that DEI be inserted into all these models. They didn't into all these models. They didn't distinguish between public and private distinguish between public and private money or government procurement versus money or government procurement versus private models. So they just they were private models. So they just they were trying to suffuse DEI into everything. trying to suffuse DEI into everything. And what we're looking for here is just And what we're looking for here is just neutrality, right? We're looking for a neutrality, right? We're looking for a lack of ideological bias. The first step lack of ideological bias. The first step was to get rid of that Biden EO, which was to get rid of that Biden EO, which the president did his first week in the president did his first week in office. This goes a little bit further office. This goes a little bit further and it's a little bit of a shot across and it's a little bit of a shot across the bow of these Silicon Valley the bow of these Silicon Valley companies saying, "Look, you need to companies saying, "Look, you need to play it straight. You need to be play it straight. You need to be ideologically unbiased." ideologically unbiased." ideologically unbiased." &gt;&gt; As the default, &gt;&gt; As the default, &gt;&gt; as the default, when you sell to the &gt;&gt; as the default, when you sell to the government, you can't insert your values government, you can't insert your values at the expense of accuracy. Look, at the at the expense of accuracy. Look, at the end of the day, accuracy and truth end of the day, accuracy and truth seeeking is the standard, right? You can seeeking is the standard, right? You can measure. That's the goal. measure. That's the goal. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want the quality, accuracy, &gt;&gt; So, we don't want the quality, accuracy, and truth seeeking to be sacrificed and truth seeeking to be sacrificed because of these any are you still are because of these any are you still seeing that are like when you you still seeing that are like when you say these Silicon Valley companies I say these Silicon Valley companies I mean is this still kind of a widespread mean is this still kind of a widespread concern or widespread deployment from concern or widespread deployment from your point of view where you're sitting your point of view where you're sitting like are you still seeing a lot of the like are you still seeing a lot of the models being trained on ideological models being trained on ideological systems that you know are preferential systems that you know are preferential to one group and not to another to one group and not to another &gt;&gt; I think it was a much bigger concern 6 &gt;&gt; I think it was a much bigger concern 6 months ago and I think there's been such months ago and I think there's been such a huge vibe shift since President a huge vibe shift since President Trump's election and taking office that Trump's election and taking office that like the woke stuff is sort of going like the woke stuff is sort of going away on its own but away on its own but &gt;&gt; I and I I think that's the trajectory &gt;&gt; I and I I think that's the trajectory we're headed. But it was we're headed. But it was &gt;&gt; But you still think it's important &gt;&gt; But you still think it's important enough to make sure that there's any enough to make sure that there's any error? error? error? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like, look, this is make sure &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like, look, this is make sure this thing doesn't come back from the this thing doesn't come back from the dead. I think that there's been a huge dead. I think that there's been a huge vibe shift since President Trump's vibe shift since President Trump's election and woke has definitely fallen election and woke has definitely fallen out of favor and it seems to be going out of favor and it seems to be going away on its own. But we could still get, away on its own. But we could still get, you know, Orwellian outcomes with AI. you know, Orwellian outcomes with AI. And I do think it's very important to And I do think it's very important to just keep underscoring that what AI just keep underscoring that what AI models should be focused on is the truth models should be focused on is the truth is on accuracy. And we don't want is on accuracy. And we don't want ideological agendas to sacrifice that. ideological agendas to sacrifice that. And um and I think I think that even And um and I think I think that even though this is a less salient issue now though this is a less salient issue now than 6 months ago, precisely because of than 6 months ago, precisely because of the vibe shift, I still think it's the vibe shift, I still think it's important to underscore this point that important to underscore this point that we don't want we don't want &gt;&gt; would you go so far &gt;&gt; would you go so far &gt;&gt; we don't want AI taking an Orwellian &gt;&gt; we don't want AI taking an Orwellian direction. direction. direction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Would you go so far as to limit &gt;&gt; Yeah. Would you go so far as to limit free speech and and make it free speech and and make it non ideologically biased? Like would you non ideologically biased? Like would you make that law if you could make that law if you could &gt;&gt; because again the the decision about the &gt;&gt; because again the the decision about the federal government procuring versus what federal government procuring versus what these private companies can choose to these private companies can choose to reflect as their quote values in their reflect as their quote values in their systems. systems. systems. &gt;&gt; No, he just you already answered that he &gt;&gt; No, he just you already answered that he would not. would not. would not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, look, I we understand the &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, look, I we understand the difference between public procurement difference between public procurement and private speech and again in a way and private speech and again in a way that the Biden administration did not that the Biden administration did not because they were saying that all AI because they were saying that all AI models models models &gt;&gt; Yes. had to be adhere to a specific &gt;&gt; Yes. had to be adhere to a specific ideology ideology ideology &gt;&gt; to the CI stuff. So &gt;&gt; to the CI stuff. So &gt;&gt; yes, it was an ideology they wanted &gt;&gt; yes, it was an ideology they wanted embedded in it. You're saying don't put embedded in it. You're saying don't put an ideology in. But just to be clear an ideology in. But just to be clear here, I want to make one point. This is here, I want to make one point. This is the defaults. Anybody who wants to could the defaults. Anybody who wants to could when they start their prompt or they set when they start their prompt or they set up their preferred language model could up their preferred language model could say, "I'm an atheist. Here's what I say, "I'm an atheist. Here's what I believe. Please speak to me with this in believe. Please speak to me with this in mind." Or, "I'm a Catholic. Uh, you mind." Or, "I'm a Catholic. Uh, you know, I'm a Protestant." Whatever you know, I'm a Protestant." Whatever you want. Here's my belief system. Please want. Here's my belief system. Please never reference, you know, these three never reference, you know, these three subject matters in this way. So this is subject matters in this way. So this is the default. I think it's a great thing the default. I think it's a great thing to to to &gt;&gt; I think that's a great example, JCAL. I &gt;&gt; I think that's a great example, JCAL. I do think we'll end up seeing religious do think we'll end up seeing religious AI. I think we'll see AI that's tuned to AI. I think we'll see AI that's tuned to people's religious people's religious people's religious ideological, but I think yeah, ideological, but I think yeah, &gt;&gt; I have one of the startups we did was &gt;&gt; I have one of the startups we did was doing a learning app and they were doing a learning app and they were struggling and they just made a prayer struggling and they just made a prayer app and their prayer app went parabolic app and their prayer app went parabolic and now they're just like printing and now they're just like printing money. So there is definitely a a huge money. So there is definitely a a huge market here. market here. market here. &gt;&gt; Check out what what were your &gt;&gt; Check out what what were your highlights? highlights? highlights? &gt;&gt; It was great to be, you know, included &gt;&gt; It was great to be, you know, included in everything. So I appreciate that we in everything. So I appreciate that we had uh No, I'm being dead serious. had uh No, I'm being dead serious. &gt;&gt; Your invitation finally didn't get lost &gt;&gt; Your invitation finally didn't get lost in the mail. in the mail. &gt;&gt; No, but here's the thing. It I think &gt;&gt; No, but here's the thing. It I think this could have been a nonall-in thing. this could have been a nonall-in thing. It could have just been, you know, you It could have just been, you know, you could have done it and just invited who could have done it and just invited who you wanted to. So I like that it was you wanted to. So I like that it was under the all-in umbrella and that we under the all-in umbrella and that we didn't censor anything and we went right didn't censor anything and we went right at hard topics. I'm a moderate. I know at hard topics. I'm a moderate. I know people want to make me into like a people want to make me into like a stupid lib, but I am an independent stupid lib, but I am an independent moderate. And there were moments in time moderate. And there were moments in time when we had great debate, too. This when we had great debate, too. This wasn't just a love letter to the wasn't just a love letter to the administration. One of the great moments administration. One of the great moments was J. D. Vance. It was just great that was J. D. Vance. It was just great that he wanted to come chop it up and just he wanted to come chop it up and just hang with the besties. And he came out hang with the besties. And he came out and he went right at me. He was like, and he went right at me. He was like, "Hey, you treated me like a beep at the "Hey, you treated me like a beep at the thing. We had a big debate and you know, thing. We had a big debate and you know, he went right at me." And then I was he went right at me." And then I was like, "Okay, it's on. Want to talk about like, "Okay, it's on. Want to talk about stuff?" And he said, "Yeah, let's get stuff?" And he said, "Yeah, let's get into it." And that's what I love about into it." And that's what I love about JD. JD to me seems like the politician JD. JD to me seems like the politician of the future. I know this is like the of the future. I know this is like the Trump's administration, but Trump's administration, but &gt;&gt; So, you like him? &gt;&gt; So, you like him? &gt;&gt; No. No. I I'm in like with Trump. I'm in &gt;&gt; No. No. I I'm in like with Trump. I'm in love with JD because he's young. He's love with JD because he's young. He's opinionated and he likes to mix it up. opinionated and he likes to mix it up. He's on Twitter all day long. He engages He's on Twitter all day long. He engages people on Twitter. He engages people in people on Twitter. He engages people in other groups. I'll leave it at that. And other groups. I'll leave it at that. And uh we had a really, I think, honest uh we had a really, I think, honest discussion about immigration. And we got discussion about immigration. And we got back to the highskilled immigration back to the highskilled immigration question. That's the third rail for MAGA question. That's the third rail for MAGA and and for the country right now. and and for the country right now. Immigration recruiting. Immigration recruiting. Immigration recruiting. &gt;&gt; You mean you brought it up right off the &gt;&gt; You mean you brought it up right off the bat? bat? bat? &gt;&gt; No. No. He said he wanted your hobby. &gt;&gt; No. No. He said he wanted your hobby. You brought it up. Your hobby horse very You brought it up. Your hobby horse very I want to continue the debate and I I want to continue the debate and I said, "Okay, let's continue the debate." said, "Okay, let's continue the debate." So, here we go. He was super spicy and So, here we go. He was super spicy and he made a great super spicy point that I he made a great super spicy point that I want to point out here on Amplify. if want to point out here on Amplify. if companies are going to be laying people companies are going to be laying people off. And there was an incredible uh off. And there was an incredible uh chart that came out. It was in the chart that came out. It was in the Financial Times and they showed male Financial Times and they showed male college graduates versus college graduates versus non-olgraduate males. And there was non-olgraduate males. And there was usually a huge gap in unemployment usually a huge gap in unemployment between those two. In other words, if between those two. In other words, if you had the college degree, you you had you had the college degree, you you had a much better chance than the non-ol a much better chance than the non-ol male. And now those two things have male. And now those two things have flipped or they're like neck and neck. flipped or they're like neck and neck. If you have a college degree, you have If you have a college degree, you have no advantage as a man coming out in no advantage as a man coming out in this, you know, 20 to 27 year old range. this, you know, 20 to 27 year old range. This is men. Women are actually doing This is men. Women are actually doing better. More women in college than men, better. More women in college than men, yada yada. But he's very attuned to yada yada. But he's very attuned to this. And he said he's got big concerns this. And he said he's got big concerns right now. So this is again why I love right now. So this is again why I love JD because JD is very tuned into the JD because JD is very tuned into the fact that people are asking for more fact that people are asking for more H-1B visas and that typically is to save H-1B visas and that typically is to save money and supposed to be very skilled money and supposed to be very skilled people. But why is Microsoft laying off people. But why is Microsoft laying off 9,000 people then asking for more, you 9,000 people then asking for more, you know, H-1B visas? This is a really know, H-1B visas? This is a really honest, truth-seeking question. And I honest, truth-seeking question. And I it's hard for this administration to it's hard for this administration to talk about this issue because I know you talk about this issue because I know you got Steve Miller, Bannon, whatever got Steve Miller, Bannon, whatever people all the way on one side who want people all the way on one side who want to deport 20, 30 million people, Tucker, to deport 20, 30 million people, Tucker, and you know, and then you have other and you know, and then you have other people who are more moderate. And I people who are more moderate. And I thought that was like a really great thought that was like a really great moment in time for America and for us as moment in time for America and for us as a podcast to challenge and have a really a podcast to challenge and have a really important discussion. And he made some important discussion. And he made some great points there. Number two, we had a great points there. Number two, we had a great debate, I think, about energy. Uh, great debate, I think, about energy. Uh, disagree. disagree. disagree. &gt;&gt; You disagree. Okay. &gt;&gt; You disagree. Okay. &gt;&gt; I disagree with the because I think you &gt;&gt; I disagree with the because I think you challenged him with I I think you challenged him with I I think you challenged him with things that were not challenged him with things that were not facts and not true. And I'm happy to facts and not true. And I'm happy to debate that with you offline. I think he debate that with you offline. I think he was caught off guard, but I think it was was caught off guard, but I think it was pretty like pretty like pretty like &gt;&gt; rough and inappropriate. &gt;&gt; rough and inappropriate. &gt;&gt; 100 If you think it's inappropriate, &gt;&gt; 100 If you think it's inappropriate, that's fine. I that's fine. I &gt;&gt; Jake's favorite moments were all the &gt;&gt; Jake's favorite moments were all the ones where he got the ones where we had ones where he got the ones where we had debates. debates. debates. &gt;&gt; That's what you're describing. &gt;&gt; That's what you're describing. &gt;&gt; No, no. Where there were debates. got &gt;&gt; No, no. Where there were debates. got with the vice president. You got into it with the vice president. You got into it with the secretary of energy. Those your with the secretary of energy. Those your favorite moments when you got to favorite moments when you got to &gt;&gt; Okay, great. So, okay, fine. I like when &gt;&gt; Okay, great. So, okay, fine. I like when there's a little conflict, a little there's a little conflict, a little debate about an important issue. And debate about an important issue. And when I walk the audience, which was, you when I walk the audience, which was, you know, 90% know, 90% know, 90% Republican, GOP, MAGA, etc. People said Republican, GOP, MAGA, etc. People said that was a great moment. I really like that was a great moment. I really like that debate because he kept saying like that debate because he kept saying like nonreliable energy and whatever. And I nonreliable energy and whatever. And I said, are you talking about solar? And I said, are you talking about solar? And I think there was a little misinformation. think there was a little misinformation. &gt;&gt; Reliable. No, it's not. &gt;&gt; Reliable. No, it's not. &gt;&gt; You put it with a battery. Right now, &gt;&gt; You put it with a battery. Right now, Texas is 30% some days wind and energy. Texas is 30% some days wind and energy. You know, like I can tell you I live in You know, like I can tell you I live in the great state of Texas. the great state of Texas. &gt;&gt; Texas is Texas roughly 5% solar. Just so &gt;&gt; Texas is Texas roughly 5% solar. Just so you know. you know. you know. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; Texas is roughly 5% solar, &gt;&gt; Texas is roughly 5% solar, &gt;&gt; right? And wind puts it up to 25 to 30% &gt;&gt; right? And wind puts it up to 25 to 30% on the top days is coming from that. My on the top days is coming from that. My point about that is and it's cheaper to point about that is and it's cheaper to put in a solar uh and battery farm than put in a solar uh and battery farm than a new coal plant. It is 100%. We can a new coal plant. It is 100%. We can pull up the stats. pull up the stats. &gt;&gt; It is twice the cost to do solar than it &gt;&gt; It is twice the cost to do solar than it is to do nat gas. It takes 4,000 acres is to do nat gas. It takes 4,000 acres whereas gas takes 20 acres. whereas gas takes 20 acres. &gt;&gt; I said coal. &gt;&gt; I said coal. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but these the big advocacy with &gt;&gt; Yeah, but these the big advocacy with these guys is to use nat gas to use these guys is to use nat gas to use methane. He was saying coal clean coal methane. He was saying coal clean coal clean coal. He said it 50 times. clean coal. He said it 50 times. &gt;&gt; These methane plants are half the cost &gt;&gt; These methane plants are half the cost of solar. They can get stood up in less of solar. They can get stood up in less than two years to generate a gigawatt. than two years to generate a gigawatt. And instead of being 4,000 acres of And instead of being 4,000 acres of solar, you can get it done for, you solar, you can get it done for, you know, call it 20 acres. Now talk a know, call it 20 acres. Now talk a little bit about pollution. And that's a little bit about pollution. And that's a big part of why they're doing this. big part of why they're doing this. Well, a big part of methane is that it's Well, a big part of methane is that it's actually cleaner than coal, which is why actually cleaner than coal, which is why they're using it. Cleaner than oilar. they're using it. Cleaner than oilar. &gt;&gt; Cleaner than oil and the two ways of &gt;&gt; Cleaner than oil and the two ways of getting energy. Now, science guy, now do getting energy. Now, science guy, now do &gt;&gt; I'm trying to give you the fact about &gt;&gt; I'm trying to give you the fact about why about why it is cheaper and faster, why about why it is cheaper and faster, which is what he was making an advocacy which is what he was making an advocacy for, right? It's not about like solar. for, right? It's not about like solar. Yes, you're right. It has a lower carbon Yes, you're right. It has a lower carbon footprint when you're running it. But at footprint when you're running it. But at the end of the day, what these guys are the end of the day, what these guys are focused on and a big challenge for focused on and a big challenge for America is how do we scale energy America is how do we scale energy production in the states and scaling production in the states and scaling energy production, I personally think we energy production, I personally think we need to fix the regulatory roadblocks in need to fix the regulatory roadblocks in nuclear. And Chris Wright's been very nuclear. And Chris Wright's been very vocal on this. vocal on this. &gt;&gt; We all agree on that. &gt;&gt; We all agree on that. &gt;&gt; But the fact is this NA gas supply that &gt;&gt; But the fact is this NA gas supply that we have in the United States and the we have in the United States and the fact that we can deploy nat gas energy fact that we can deploy nat gas energy production very quickly is what makes it production very quickly is what makes it such a reliable source right now. if the such a reliable source right now. if the US wants to have a chance at scaling US wants to have a chance at scaling from 1 terowatt to two faster than from 1 terowatt to two faster than projected today and that's the reason projected today and that's the reason you know it's not it's not about like you know it's not it's not about like solar is being bad solar is bad like solar is being bad solar is bad like that's not the the argument it's just that's not the the argument it's just like dude we we got to get moving fast like dude we we got to get moving fast and we got to have reliable energy and we got to have reliable energy in our debates I just want to point in in our debates I just want to point in our debates when there's bad faith our debates when there's bad faith moments I think it's a bad faith moment moments I think it's a bad faith moment for when I say coal versus solar and for when I say coal versus solar and then you say no you're wrong it's solar then you say no you're wrong it's solar versus n gas and that's what he was versus n gas and that's what he was doing this is what politicians do here doing this is what politicians do here all in. We like to do, you know, uh, all in. We like to do, you know, uh, fact-based, truth first stuff, not fact-based, truth first stuff, not biased stuff. And so solar, you're biased stuff. And so solar, you're comparing. So, you know, solar and how comparing. So, you know, solar and how fast it is versus how fast it is to go fast it is versus how fast it is to go to net gas. Of course, it's faster to go to net gas. Of course, it's faster to go to net gas if we have those available. to net gas if we have those available. Let's put that aside. It's an important Let's put that aside. It's an important debate. The fact that you and I are debate. The fact that you and I are debating it is important. And I also debating it is important. And I also thought Lisa from AMD was fantastic. I thought Lisa from AMD was fantastic. I haven't heard from her. By the way, I haven't heard from her. By the way, I just want to point out that when I got just want to point out that when I got back to the conference, so I I left for back to the conference, so I I left for a time to go back to the White House and a time to go back to the White House and then I came back. then I came back. &gt;&gt; The first thing everyone said to me &gt;&gt; The first thing everyone said to me &gt;&gt; when I got back was, &gt;&gt; when I got back was, &gt;&gt; "Did you see Jal being a jerk to Chris &gt;&gt; "Did you see Jal being a jerk to Chris Wright?" They were everyone was like, Wright?" They were everyone was like, "Oh, about the Yeah, a jerk. "Oh, about the Yeah, a jerk. &gt;&gt; He's a civil servant. He has to answer &gt;&gt; He's a civil servant. He has to answer hard questions. You didn't talk to him hard questions. You didn't talk to him in a in a in a in the way that you in a in a in a in the way that you would." Basically, everyone thought you would." Basically, everyone thought you were a jerk to Chris, right? And you were a jerk to Chris, right? And you were kind of a jerk to JD. And what are were kind of a jerk to JD. And what are your favorite moments? your favorite moments? &gt;&gt; Call me an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Call me an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; What are your favorite moments from the &gt;&gt; What are your favorite moments from the conference? You're reminiscing about conference? You're reminiscing about &gt;&gt; that. You were an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me. &gt;&gt; that. You were an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me. &gt;&gt; Anyway, the point is one thing you're &gt;&gt; Anyway, the point is one thing you're going to get here at the Allin. going to get here at the Allin. This is where everyone% This is where everyone% two out of three were two out of three were &gt;&gt; everyone was saying this. You almost &gt;&gt; everyone was saying this. You almost derailed the whole thing. derailed the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Nobody derailed. You're a civil servant, &gt;&gt; Nobody derailed. You're a civil servant, Mr. Sachs. You're a civil servant. Mr. Sachs. You're a civil servant. You're all civil servants. You're all civil servants. &gt;&gt; I've been putting up with you for 5 &gt;&gt; I've been putting up with you for 5 years on this podcast. years on this podcast. &gt;&gt; The hard questions. &gt;&gt; The hard questions. &gt;&gt; It was perfect training for government &gt;&gt; It was perfect training for government services beyond the podcast being services beyond the podcast being interrupted by you for 5 years. interrupted by you for 5 years. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm so ready to dwell. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm so ready to dwell. &gt;&gt; You learn about you work for us, all of &gt;&gt; You learn about you work for us, all of you. And you're all going to take hard you. And you're all going to take hard questions. And you're all going to take questions. And you're all going to take hard questions on September 7th, 8th, hard questions on September 7th, 8th, and 9th when we have the allin summit in and 9th when we have the allin summit in &gt;&gt; Los Angeles. By the way, by the way, one &gt;&gt; Los Angeles. By the way, by the way, one thing I'll say is Chris Wright's chief thing I'll say is Chris Wright's chief of staff came out to me afterwards and I of staff came out to me afterwards and I said, "Oh, I'm sorry. I heard Jake was a said, "Oh, I'm sorry. I heard Jake was a jerk to to Secretary Wright and he's jerk to to Secretary Wright and he's like, "Oh, no. Chris loved it. He loves like, "Oh, no. Chris loved it. He loves mixing it up." Okay, of course. mixing it up." Okay, of course. &gt;&gt; And he's coming to he's coming to Olan &gt;&gt; And he's coming to Olan Summit in on September 8th. So, Summit in on September 8th. So, &gt;&gt; can't wait to debate him more. Can't &gt;&gt; can't wait to debate him more. Can't wait to mix it up more. wait to mix it up more. &gt;&gt; So, he he likes mixing it up. So, kudos &gt;&gt; So, he he likes mixing it up. So, kudos to him. to him. to him. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And so did so did JD Vance, the vice &gt;&gt; And so did so did JD Vance, the vice president to you. Stop calling him JD, president to you. Stop calling him JD, by the way. Well, I mean, listen, I just by the way. Well, I mean, listen, I just want to say Vice President J. D. Vance want to say Vice President J. D. Vance and I have been directly communicating. and I have been directly communicating. We had a We Yes. We had a We Yes. &gt;&gt; No, you haven't. &gt;&gt; No, you haven't. &gt;&gt; David Sachs, your worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; David Sachs, your worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Your worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Your worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; The nation is ruined. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; The nation is ruined.

But &gt;&gt; Or Secret Service keeps up stage. But the truth is, this is one of the great the truth is, this is one of the great things about this administration sex is things about this administration sex is that they love to mix it up. They like that they love to mix it up. They like great debate. You know who didn't like great debate. You know who didn't like great debate and ran from it? Kalama great debate and ran from it? Kalama Ding-Dong. She wouldn't even come on Ding-Dong. She wouldn't even come on this podcast. You know who doesn't like this podcast. You know who doesn't like debate? Tik Tok. debate? Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; We get that at Bernie's Biden who didn't &gt;&gt; We get that at Bernie's Biden who didn't even know what a podcast [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. even know what a podcast [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. &gt;&gt; Tim Waltz who doesn't own &gt;&gt; Tim Waltz who doesn't own &gt;&gt; you. You definitely you definitely have &gt;&gt; you. You definitely you definitely have your moments, bro. You definitely have. your moments, bro. You definitely have. &gt;&gt; But Tim Waltz doesn't own an equity. He &gt;&gt; But Tim Waltz doesn't own an equity. He literally doesn't own one share of any literally doesn't own one share of any company, doesn't his home company, doesn't his home &gt;&gt; and Tim Waltz is on there giving a hard &gt;&gt; and Tim Waltz is on there giving a hard time about the uh Trump savings time about the uh Trump savings accounts. accounts. accounts. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't even know if that's a &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't even know if that's a hat though, which you loved. You thought hat though, which you loved. You thought that was going to win the election. I that was going to win the election. I thought he might be able to speak to thought he might be able to speak to like the middle of America and then I like the middle of America and then I find out like find out like &gt;&gt; when they do the the Deep Oppo research &gt;&gt; when they do the the Deep Oppo research that the guy doesn't own one stock. that the guy doesn't own one stock. &gt;&gt; The guy doesn't own his home. He's &gt;&gt; The guy doesn't own his home. He's financially illiterate and we're making financially illiterate and we're making him him him &gt;&gt; employed by the government. He's been &gt;&gt; employed by the government. He's been employed by the government his whole employed by the government his whole life. life. life. &gt;&gt; I mean, have you &gt;&gt; I mean, have you There it is. There it is. &gt;&gt; That's what Jake thought would win the &gt;&gt; That's what Jake thought would win the election. election. election. &gt;&gt; You're never going to live that down. I &gt;&gt; You're never going to live that down. I remember when you tweeted you thought remember when you tweeted you thought that was it. You thought that was the that was it. You thought that was the master stroke. I thought it might master stroke. I thought it might &gt;&gt; master stroke that was going to win them &gt;&gt; master stroke that was going to win them the election. the election. the election. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. No straanis does not bat a &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. No straanis does not bat a thousand. No, no, even no straanis thousand. No, no, even no straanis cannot bat a thousand. But it did come cannot bat a thousand. But it did come out, by the way, that Nancy Pelosi out, by the way, that Nancy Pelosi wanted to do the speedrun primary. I wanted to do the speedrun primary. I don't know if you saw that, just not to don't know if you saw that, just not to rehash too much stuff. Sax, I want to um rehash too much stuff. Sax, I want to um say there was one point of difference if say there was one point of difference if you want to get into it around the the you want to get into it around the the the content part of part of it where and the content part of part of it where and this is something that this is something that &gt;&gt; the press was having a field day with &gt;&gt; the press was having a field day with and they really keyed on which was hey and they really keyed on which was hey respecting IP, respecting copyright. respecting IP, respecting copyright. What's the feedback been so far on that What's the feedback been so far on that which was a pretty spicy part of which was a pretty spicy part of President Trump's speech? President Trump's speech? &gt;&gt; Well, I think what the president said &gt;&gt; Well, I think what the president said was just very pragmatic. He said we had was just very pragmatic. He said we had to have a common sense approach towards to have a common sense approach towards intellectual property. And he said if intellectual property. And he said if you have to make a deal with every you have to make a deal with every single article on the internet, every single article on the internet, every single website, every single book, every single website, every single book, every piece of IP in order to train an AI piece of IP in order to train an AI model, it wasn't feasible. He said, model, it wasn't feasible. He said, "Look, I appreciate the work that went "Look, I appreciate the work that went into people creating these works, but into people creating these works, but you're not going to be able to negotiate you're not going to be able to negotiate a deal for every single one of them. And a deal for every single one of them. And if we require our AI models to do that if we require our AI models to do that and China doesn't and they won't. and China doesn't and they won't. They're just training on everything They're just training on everything whether it's you know pirated or not whether it's you know pirated or not then we're going to lose AI race. So I then we're going to lose AI race. So I think he took the side of a fair use think he took the side of a fair use definition. I don't know if he used the definition. I don't know if he used the term fair use but effectively he was term fair use but effectively he was taking the side of a reasonable fair taking the side of a reasonable fair use. use. use. &gt;&gt; What did you think of that part Dave &gt;&gt; What did you think of that part Dave Freeberg? You have any thoughts for Freeberg? You have any thoughts for Jimoth on that part? Jimoth on that part? &gt;&gt; I think he's absolutely right. I've said &gt;&gt; I think he's absolutely right. I've said this before. If something's in the this before. If something's in the internet, if something's in the open internet, if something's in the open domain, and I strongly disagree with the domain, and I strongly disagree with the idea that AI getting trained is the same idea that AI getting trained is the same as AI replicating copyright material. If as AI replicating copyright material. If AI outputs text or outputs audio or AI outputs text or outputs audio or outputs video that contains copyright outputs video that contains copyright material, it is 100% in violation of material, it is 100% in violation of copyright. copyright. copyright. &gt;&gt; And he said that, by the way, &gt;&gt; And he said that, by the way, &gt;&gt; yes. And if the AI is learning, it is &gt;&gt; yes. And if the AI is learning, it is understanding patterns, it is understanding patterns, it is understanding reasoning, it is understanding reasoning, it is understanding concepts by reading understanding concepts by reading copyright material just like humans do. copyright material just like humans do. A writer, an author reads a bunch of A writer, an author reads a bunch of fiction, learns good techniques, learns fiction, learns good techniques, learns good concepts, learns good theory from good concepts, learns good theory from reading all those books and then goes reading all those books and then goes and writes his or her own book. They are and writes his or her own book. They are not violating copyright material. In the not violating copyright material. In the same way, same way, same way, Freeberg, what if it's all the New York Freeberg, what if it's all the New York Times on the open internet? Times on the open internet? &gt;&gt; 100%. You're you're 100% correct that &gt;&gt; 100%. You're you're 100% correct that should be paid for or licensed. I'm should be paid for or licensed. I'm talking about the open internet. I'm talking about the open internet. I'm talking about open material. I'm talking talking about open material. I'm talking about stuff that's in the open domain about stuff that's in the open domain which which which &gt;&gt; common crawl. &gt;&gt; common crawl. &gt;&gt; There's a thing called common crawl. &gt;&gt; There's a thing called common crawl. &gt;&gt; If there was if somebody stole a hundred &gt;&gt; If there was if somebody stole a hundred books, let's say, and put them on their books, let's say, and put them on their website and it was a pirated Russian website and it was a pirated Russian website with a thousand books on it and website with a thousand books on it and you accidentally crawled it, you would you accidentally crawled it, you would be obligated to take that out then. I be obligated to take that out then. I think we all agree. think we all agree. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Okay. Correct. &gt;&gt; Okay. Correct. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what a lot of the lawsuits &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what a lot of the lawsuits around. So, I think we're reaching around. So, I think we're reaching something. I just want to say, you know, something. I just want to say, you know, this is such an important point, this is such an important point, especially to me as a content creator especially to me as a content creator and somebody who spent his career in and somebody who spent his career in this. I've been thinking about the this. I've been thinking about the endgame and um I was I'm here in Park endgame and um I was I'm here in Park City. I was just giving a a keynote and City. I was just giving a a keynote and I wanted to show you something I made I wanted to show you something I made saxs because I think we have to get to saxs because I think we have to get to the the endgame here. So, in my talk, I the the endgame here. So, in my talk, I talked a little bit about how can we get talked a little bit about how can we get through this fight and then maybe through this fight and then maybe getting to a solution. So, I had my team getting to a solution. So, I had my team mock up mock up mock up the New York Times website here and chat the New York Times website here and chat GPT doing a deal with them. So, here you GPT doing a deal with them. So, here you see you're on the New York Times website see you're on the New York Times website and you ask it a question powered by and you ask it a question powered by GPT. You ask it, hey, you might ask this GPT. You ask it, hey, you might ask this question. In fact, you log in with your question. In fact, you log in with your chat GPT credentials. You're and it chat GPT credentials. You're and it could be Gro, it could be Gemini. Give could be Gro, it could be Gemini. Give me the earliest mentions of Putin, you me the earliest mentions of Putin, you know, if you were a fan of Putin or know, if you were a fan of Putin or something. And it would then go through something. And it would then go through that and give you your your Putin that and give you your your Putin references. And then I made another one. references. And then I made another one. And then obviously this would be an And then obviously this would be an exclusive to Chat GPT. It would be one exclusive to Chat GPT. It would be one of those things where you know they get of those things where you know they get an exclusive. And then here on the uh an exclusive. And then here on the uh Disney Plus channel, imagine you could Disney Plus channel, imagine you could make yourself into a Jedi Knight and you make yourself into a Jedi Knight and you could then upload your photo. You know, could then upload your photo. You know, kids might really get into this. You kids might really get into this. You upload your photo, you can make You upload your photo, you can make You talked about this free a couple of times talked about this free a couple of times of the future of narrative storytelling. of the future of narrative storytelling. You up your photo and then it makes you You up your photo and then it makes you into a Jedi Knight. There's there's into a Jedi Knight. There's there's Darth Calacanis. So Darth Calacanis. So &gt;&gt; that looks to me like you're infringing &gt;&gt; that looks to me like you're infringing on their trademark. What's that? on their trademark. What's that? &gt;&gt; Are you infringing on their their &gt;&gt; Are you infringing on their their copyright? copyright? copyright? &gt;&gt; This is fair use. This &gt;&gt; This is fair use. This is a perfect example of fair use for is a perfect example of fair use for editorial. editorial. editorial. &gt;&gt; You're also infringing on some Osmpic. &gt;&gt; You're also infringing on some Osmpic. That's absolutely infringing. That's absolutely infringing. &gt;&gt; Trust me, I am definitely infringing on &gt;&gt; Trust me, I am definitely infringing on some OMIC here, guys. I'm I'm past some OMIC here, guys. I'm I'm past those. I'm on to peptides now, man. I'm those. I'm on to peptides now, man. I'm on the Wolverine protocol. So, look at on the Wolverine protocol. So, look at &gt;&gt; Are you &gt;&gt; Are you &gt;&gt; Yeah, I started doing the I mean I I &gt;&gt; Yeah, I started doing the I mean I I don't What could go wrong? don't What could go wrong? &gt;&gt; Don't take a podcaster's advice. Please &gt;&gt; Don't take a podcaster's advice. Please don't take a podcaster's advice on your don't take a podcaster's advice on your healthcare rule number one. Take healthcare rule number one. Take Chimat's advice because he's got 6% body Chimat's advice because he's got 6% body fat, which I think attributes to much of fat, which I think attributes to much of your pomp and circumstance around your your pomp and circumstance around your privates. I think it has to do with the privates. I think it has to do with the lack of fat. But I'm going to leave it lack of fat. But I'm going to leave it at that. at that. at that. &gt;&gt; First of all, it's 11 and a half, but &gt;&gt; First of all, it's 11 and a half, but you know, it that's that's like right you know, it that's that's like right before I go on summer that's like right before I go on summer vacation. Then it then it ends up at 12 vacation. Then it then it ends up at 12 or 13. or 13. or 13. &gt;&gt; Did you go get that? Did you go get that &gt;&gt; Did you go get that? Did you go get that gelato? What was that place we went that gelato? What was that place we went that we love? Lulu me. I've gone there every we love? Lulu me. I've gone there every day. Every day so far. day. Every day so far. &gt;&gt; Did you do two or one? Be honest. Two or &gt;&gt; Did you do two or one? Be honest. Two or one? one? one? &gt;&gt; Bro, I've had I've had I've been doing &gt;&gt; Bro, I've had I've had I've been doing &gt;&gt; No, no. Per session. Do you do two or &gt;&gt; No, no. Per session. Do you do two or one? Be honest. one? Be honest. &gt;&gt; Per session, too. I start with the &gt;&gt; Per session, too. I start with the medium and then and I finish with a medium and then and I finish with a small. small. small. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. You This stuff is so &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. You This stuff is so good. good. good. &gt;&gt; I've never tasted any gelato like this. &gt;&gt; I've never tasted any gelato like this. It's incredible. It's incredible. It's incredible. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's unbelievable. We have to &gt;&gt; I mean, it's unbelievable. We have to license it for the United States and the license it for the United States and the all-in brand. We have to license it from all-in brand. We have to license it from them. them. them. &gt;&gt; It's really incredible. But Chamath just &gt;&gt; It's really incredible. But Chamath just generally speaking or anybody who wants generally speaking or anybody who wants to have at it. Friedberg Sachs, what do to have at it. Friedberg Sachs, what do we think about the endgame here? Because we think about the endgame here? Because there's some major lawsuits here. there's some major lawsuits here. They're going to get settled in the next They're going to get settled in the next year or two. What What do we think about year or two. What What do we think about sort of the future I've shown here sort of the future I've shown here today? today? today? &gt;&gt; I think what Sax just highlighted is &gt;&gt; I think what Sax just highlighted is exactly right. exactly right. exactly right. &gt;&gt; Look, we got to have a common sense &gt;&gt; Look, we got to have a common sense approach here or we're going to lose the approach here or we're going to lose the AI race. I mean, one of the out one of AI race. I mean, one of the out one of the key determinants the key determinants &gt;&gt; of AI quality is the amount of data that &gt;&gt; of AI quality is the amount of data that you have. It's very simple, right? It's you have. It's very simple, right? It's there's a few building blocks. There's there's a few building blocks. There's energy, there's chips, and there's data, energy, there's chips, and there's data, and there's algorithms. And if you lose and there's algorithms. And if you lose on any one of those dimensions, then on any one of those dimensions, then you're in trouble, right? you're in trouble, right? &gt;&gt; So, look, you just can't have a &gt;&gt; So, look, you just can't have a situation where China can train on the situation where China can train on the entire internet. And RAI models are entire internet. And RAI models are hamstrung by needing to contract, hamstrung by needing to contract, &gt;&gt; negotiate contracts with every single &gt;&gt; negotiate contracts with every single website. website. website. &gt;&gt; But right now, Europe, Elon owns X, &gt;&gt; But right now, Europe, Elon owns X, right? He owns Twitter for now X. Does right? He owns Twitter for now X. Does Sam Alman have the right to use X in his Sam Alman have the right to use X in his corpus? corpus? corpus? &gt;&gt; It's public. &gt;&gt; It's public. &gt;&gt; No, it's not. No, it is not public &gt;&gt; No, it's not. No, it is not public endpoint. endpoint. endpoint. &gt;&gt; It's not a public. &gt;&gt; It's not a public. &gt;&gt; I just honestly I don't &gt;&gt; I just honestly I don't &gt;&gt; there's I don't know the answer to that. &gt;&gt; there's I don't know the answer to that. There's some edge cases here. We're There's some edge cases here. We're going to have to come up with going to have to come up with &gt;&gt; It's not about whether it's behind a &gt;&gt; It's not about whether it's behind a payw wall or not. It's whether these payw wall or not. It's whether these APIs exist and whether you're you're APIs exist and whether you're you're actually contractually allowed to use actually contractually allowed to use them or not. them or not. &gt;&gt; The terms of service. Correct. &gt;&gt; The terms of service. Correct. &gt;&gt; The terms of service. It's published on &gt;&gt; The terms of service. It's published on every website what the terms of service every website what the terms of service are with respect to the content. I think are with respect to the content. I think it would be okay to let people opt out, it would be okay to let people opt out, you know. So, we already have this with you know. So, we already have this with Common Crawl. You can put in the footer Common Crawl. You can put in the footer of the website, you put in robots.txt of the website, you put in robots.txt and you opt out of Common Crawl. and you opt out of Common Crawl. &gt;&gt; Common Crawl is like this nonprofit &gt;&gt; Common Crawl is like this nonprofit organization that basically archives the organization that basically archives the entire web every few months. entire web every few months. &gt;&gt; Funded by Gil Elbaz, &gt;&gt; Funded by Gil Elbaz, &gt;&gt; former Yeah. &gt;&gt; former Yeah. &gt;&gt; formerly of Google. Great fan of the &gt;&gt; formerly of Google. Great fan of the pod. Shows up to our summits. Great guy. pod. Shows up to our summits. Great guy. &gt;&gt; And all of Open AI was built off of &gt;&gt; And all of Open AI was built off of Common Crawl originally. Common Crawl originally. And he but they're very clear by the And he but they're very clear by the way. They say you have to clear way. They say you have to clear copyrights. You don't get to just use copyrights. You don't get to just use open Chrome. open Chrome. open Chrome. &gt;&gt; Can I go out on a limb? I don't know if &gt;&gt; Can I go out on a limb? I don't know if you guys saw this Amazon deal with the you guys saw this Amazon deal with the New York Times for $25 million. Did you New York Times for $25 million. Did you see that today? see that today? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I didn't see today. Explain it, please. &gt;&gt; I didn't see today. Explain it, please. &gt;&gt; I think that the New York Times licensed &gt;&gt; I think that the New York Times licensed Amazon all of their content, including Amazon all of their content, including The Athletic and a bunch of other things The Athletic and a bunch of other things for training. 20 million. Sorry, 20 for training. 20 million. Sorry, 20 million a year. million a year. &gt;&gt; Okay, here we I read that and I thought &gt;&gt; Okay, here we I read that and I thought this is the peak of these deals. These this is the peak of these deals. These deals will only go down in terms of deals will only go down in terms of dollar value from here. dollar value from here. And it it actually brought me to this And it it actually brought me to this point where I was thinking to myself, is point where I was thinking to myself, is it even realistic it even realistic to believe that patents and copyrights to believe that patents and copyrights actually exist in 5 years? And I went actually exist in 5 years? And I went through this exercise of like if a through this exercise of like if a computer studies the computer studies the periodic table and also understands the periodic table and also understands the laws of physics, the laws of biology, laws of physics, the laws of biology, the laws of chemistry and then the laws of chemistry and then independently deres independently deres independently deres some material that is otherwise some material that is otherwise patented, patented, patented, what will happen? what will happen? And then separately, if two competing And then separately, if two competing AIs invent a new material from scratch, AIs invent a new material from scratch, how will the international courts deal how will the international courts deal with this? And if you take all of these with this? And if you take all of these examples to the limit, at the limit, the examples to the limit, at the limit, the idea that there are copyrights, idea that there are copyrights, enforcable copyrights, enforcable copyrights, enforcable copyrights, I think is a very fragile assumption. So I think is a very fragile assumption. So I'm actually thinking more that we have I'm actually thinking more that we have to spend some time understanding the to spend some time understanding the landscape of a world that doesn't have landscape of a world that doesn't have copyrights and patent protections and copyrights and patent protections and instead what is the surface area in instead what is the surface area in which you compete what is trade secret which you compete what is trade secret what does that mean in a world of AI and what does that mean in a world of AI and I think it's quite an interesting thing I think it's quite an interesting thing to think about to think about patents are a totally different piece I patents are a totally different piece I think that's a fascinating string to think that's a fascinating string to pull on I will tell you I will take the pull on I will tell you I will take the other side of the bet if we want to make other side of the bet if we want to make a poly market on this. I will guarantee a poly market on this. I will guarantee that this will be the beginning of the that this will be the beginning of the deals and the deals will go up from deals and the deals will go up from here. I'll tell you why. The reason the here. I'll tell you why. The reason the New York Times made that deal is to make New York Times made that deal is to make it apparent that what OpenAI has done it apparent that what OpenAI has done has damaged their business because now has damaged their business because now they have a customer and their customer they have a customer and their customer is Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Jasse and is Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Jasse and now they can show damages because and now they can show damages because and now those damages could give them an now those damages could give them an injunction against OpenAI and OpenAI's injunction against OpenAI and OpenAI's got to take it out of their crawl of got to take it out of their crawl of their you know construct and that's their you know construct and that's going to be really expensive for them. going to be really expensive for them. It's not not doable, but it's going to It's not not doable, but it's going to be expensive. And let's think on a be expensive. And let's think on a societal basis of what we want as a societal basis of what we want as a society. Do we want a society in which society. Do we want a society in which journalists, writers, artists, journalists, writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, actors cannot musicians, filmmakers, actors cannot make a living, podcasters, or do we want make a living, podcasters, or do we want a world in which they can? a world in which they can? &gt;&gt; And I think technologists, &gt;&gt; And I think technologists, &gt;&gt; hold on, let me hold on. As a &gt;&gt; hold on, let me hold on. As a technologist, as a technologist, we technologist, as a technologist, we typically think if we can crawl it, it's typically think if we can crawl it, it's ours. ours. ours. &gt;&gt; What I can tell you as an artist is if I &gt;&gt; What I can tell you as an artist is if I make it, it's mine. and you need my make it, it's mine. and you need my permission because it's my art and I permission because it's my art and I think it the industry will do better if think it the industry will do better if they respect them because now the New they respect them because now the New York Times can hire more fact checkers. York Times can hire more fact checkers. &gt;&gt; But can I just ask you a question? &gt;&gt; But can I just ask you a question? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. Sure. &gt;&gt; But why do you have to connect the two &gt;&gt; But why do you have to connect the two as immutable things? meaning why can't as immutable things? meaning why can't somebody make something still you know somebody make something still you know let's just say it's a song but that song let's just say it's a song but that song can now be made by multiple AI models can now be made by multiple AI models but if they make the song but if they make the song there's a reasonable claim that even if there's a reasonable claim that even if they don't have the copyright more they don't have the copyright more people will want them to perform the people will want them to perform the song than some random AI song than some random AI so can't you make a living without so can't you make a living without having the copyright having the copyright &gt;&gt; which is the choice of the artist some &gt;&gt; which is the choice of the artist some artists are were very well known for not artists are were very well known for not wanting their art to exist in some wanting their art to exist in some mediums. As a perfect example, the mediums. As a perfect example, the Rolling Stones for a long time thought Rolling Stones for a long time thought they would be sellouts if they had their they would be sellouts if they had their music used in commercials. And when they music used in commercials. And when they did Start Me Up with Windows, that was a did Start Me Up with Windows, that was a really big concession from them. And really big concession from them. And that's up to the artist to make that that's up to the artist to make that decision. You make a a valid claim. Hey, decision. You make a a valid claim. Hey, yeah, you go on tour and make more yeah, you go on tour and make more money. But that's the artist decision, money. But that's the artist decision, not the technologists or the people not the technologists or the people stealing their content. And by the way, stealing their content. And by the way, $20 million a year is a hundred $200,000 $20 million a year is a hundred $200,000 highly paid journalists, fact checkers highly paid journalists, fact checkers at the New York Times. They're going to at the New York Times. They're going to get 10 of those deals. And it's going to get 10 of those deals. And it's going to create a golden era age of journalism create a golden era age of journalism and content. And we should be happy. and content. And we should be happy. &gt;&gt; I told you this example, Jason, but at &gt;&gt; I told you this example, Jason, but at at Beast, we did a a licensing deal of at Beast, we did a a licensing deal of our content to allow OpenAI to learn our content to allow OpenAI to learn &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to run training runs on our videos. And &gt;&gt; to run training runs on our videos. And at the board, the thing that we kept at the board, the thing that we kept talking about was I was I was really talking about was I was I was really concerned like, let's just do a a couple concerned like, let's just do a a couple year deal max. year deal max. &gt;&gt; And the reason is we have no idea what &gt;&gt; And the reason is we have no idea what this looks like. in this looks like. in &gt;&gt; five or 10 years. And there's just as &gt;&gt; five or 10 years. And there's just as much chance to your point that we get it much chance to your point that we get it wrong as right. Now that was about 6 wrong as right. Now that was about 6 months ago. And so the intuition that I months ago. And so the intuition that I had back then was maybe we should keep had back then was maybe we should keep the deal term as short as possible. But the deal term as short as possible. But now when I see how important AI is in now when I see how important AI is in the global landscape and what China is the global landscape and what China is doing, I think on the margins that this doing, I think on the margins that this idea that these copyrights will mean idea that these copyrights will mean something something something &gt;&gt; in my mind, I am underwriting the value &gt;&gt; in my mind, I am underwriting the value of these things going to zero and I'm of these things going to zero and I'm asking myself instead for my businesses, asking myself instead for my businesses, how are we actually building a real how are we actually building a real defensible moat and not a piece of paper defensible moat and not a piece of paper that we can use to sue somebody? that we can use to sue somebody? &gt;&gt; Okay, Freeberg, you want the last word &gt;&gt; Okay, Freeberg, you want the last word here? We got to move on to some other here? We got to move on to some other topics. I topics. I topics. I &gt;&gt; I just want to be the last word. &gt;&gt; I just want to be the last word. &gt;&gt; I just want to be clear that nobody is &gt;&gt; I just want to be clear that nobody is losing their copyright. losing their copyright. &gt;&gt; Copyright is the right not to have your &gt;&gt; Copyright is the right not to have your work copied. And if an AI model produces work copied. And if an AI model produces outputs that copy or plagiarize your outputs that copy or plagiarize your work, then that's a violation of the work, then that's a violation of the law. law. law. &gt;&gt; And I think the president specifically &gt;&gt; And I think the president specifically said that we're not allowing copying or said that we're not allowing copying or plagiarizing. The question is whether AI plagiarizing. The question is whether AI models are allowed to do math on the models are allowed to do math on the internet. You know, internet. You know, &gt;&gt; pattern recognition pattern recognition. &gt;&gt; pattern recognition pattern recognition. &gt;&gt; Basically, that's what it is. And it's &gt;&gt; Basically, that's what it is. And it's and Jal, I think you're conflating the and Jal, I think you're conflating the two. And I I don't want to be two. And I I don't want to be interrupted. I just want to say this. interrupted. I just want to say this. &gt;&gt; I understand the distinction. &gt;&gt; I understand the distinction. &gt;&gt; And and I think that this idea that like &gt;&gt; And and I think that this idea that like I can't, for example, go to the library, I can't, for example, go to the library, rent a book, read it, and then learn rent a book, read it, and then learn some of the good techniques on how to some of the good techniques on how to write a good book should be restricted write a good book should be restricted to humans in this AI context. Like this to humans in this AI context. Like this is exactly what they're doing. They're is exactly what they're doing. They're identifying patterns and then they're identifying patterns and then they're building predictive algorithms that building predictive algorithms that allow them to output stuff that starts allow them to output stuff that starts to fit within different kind of, you to fit within different kind of, you know, variable settings. Do you guys know, variable settings. Do you guys think it's possible that if you think it's possible that if you allocated enough compute allocated enough compute at the problem, you could write Michael at the problem, you could write Michael Kryton's Jurassic Park Denovo without Kryton's Jurassic Park Denovo without ever having read it? ever having read it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too. Me too. I I think &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too. Me too. I I think &gt;&gt; I don't know what that would mean. Like, &gt;&gt; I don't know what that would mean. Like, &gt;&gt; well, this is my point. I know who &gt;&gt; well, this is my point. I know who Michael is and I know what Jurassic Park Michael is and I know what Jurassic Park is. I don't know what it means is. I don't know what it means &gt;&gt; this issue. &gt;&gt; this issue. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it means to say can AI &gt;&gt; I don't know what it means to say can AI write that like write that like &gt;&gt; but you guys remember the Ed Sheeran &gt;&gt; but you guys remember the Ed Sheeran lawsuit. Do you remember the lawsuit? lawsuit. Do you remember the lawsuit? &gt;&gt; I I did. But let me just make one point &gt;&gt; I I did. But let me just make one point here on this cuz you're saying I don't here on this cuz you're saying I don't understand it. I spent my career in it. understand it. I spent my career in it. I understand it much better than you do I understand it much better than you do &gt;&gt; and I understand it from lawsuits and &gt;&gt; and I understand it from lawsuits and being in the weeds on it. Like I being in the weeds on it. Like I understand it from first principles understand it from first principles which you do not. And I will say this is which you do not. And I will say this is what we're talking about here is the what we're talking about here is the definition. It's the definition of a definition. It's the definition of a derivative work. and the output matters. derivative work. and the output matters. So if you were to take my knowledge and So if you were to take my knowledge and then create a derivative work from it then create a derivative work from it and you used a percentage of my work and and you used a percentage of my work and that's where this will get into the that's where this will get into the nuance is what percentage of the nuance is what percentage of the original work is used in the derivative original work is used in the derivative work and under what context a commercial work and under what context a commercial context or a non-commercial this is context or a non-commercial this is clearly a commercial one if it's a if clearly a commercial one if it's a if openai was a nonprofit right now we'd be openai was a nonprofit right now we'd be having a distinctly different discussion having a distinctly different discussion because it would there would be you because it would there would be you wouldn't be competing with me as the wouldn't be competing with me as the copyright holder to use this new medium copyright holder to use this new medium and create the derivative works and it and create the derivative works and it has to change substantially. So if it's has to change substantially. So if it's a cliffnotes a if it's a cliffnotes &gt;&gt; when China has the only models that are &gt;&gt; when China has the only models that are able to meet your stringent definitions able to meet your stringent definitions of copyright. of copyright. of copyright. &gt;&gt; Well, no. Here's the thing. I think the &gt;&gt; Well, no. Here's the thing. I think the China fear [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is China fear the China fear [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll be totally honest here. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll be totally honest here. Just because China steals IP does not Just because China steals IP does not mean you get to steal from Americans. In mean you get to steal from Americans. In America, we have rules. And when you go America, we have rules. And when you go to China, and by the way, we spent the to China, and by the way, we spent the last 30 years. The major issue with last 30 years. The major issue with China is not Taiwan. It has been China is not Taiwan. It has been the technology industry itself. Let me the technology industry itself. Let me finish. The technology industry itself finish. The technology industry itself has leaned on our government for 30, 40 has leaned on our government for 30, 40 years, including Microsoft, including years, including Microsoft, including Google, to make sure our trade secrets Google, to make sure our trade secrets are not stolen, our IP is not stolen, are not stolen, our IP is not stolen, our movies are not stolen. That is the our movies are not stolen. That is the key issue with China. So just because key issue with China. So just because China's a thief does not mean American China's a thief does not mean American companies get to companies get to &gt;&gt; have you seen Have you seen the latest &gt;&gt; have you seen Have you seen the latest batch of Chinese open source models or batch of Chinese open source models or open models? open models? open models? &gt;&gt; They they steal everything. Does that &gt;&gt; They they steal everything. Does that mean you should be able to steal mean you should be able to steal Windows? Should you be able to steal Windows? Should you be able to steal Jason? We don't think it's stealing. Jason? We don't think it's stealing. Elon has said this pretty clearly, but Elon has said this pretty clearly, but Grock 5 and for sure Grock 6 will not Grock 5 and for sure Grock 6 will not use Common Crawl. It will not use the use Common Crawl. It will not use the internet. Okay? It'll just be an internet. Okay? It'll just be an enormous amount of synthetic data. And enormous amount of synthetic data. And back to what Freeberg and I just agreed back to what Freeberg and I just agreed upon, if you synthetically go and try to upon, if you synthetically go and try to generate all this content to learn generate all this content to learn across, you're invariably going to across, you're invariably going to produce something that's already been produce something that's already been created. created. created. &gt;&gt; That's like some sci-fi level. &gt;&gt; That's like some sci-fi level. &gt;&gt; I understand. That's what's happening &gt;&gt; I understand. That's what's happening now. It's happening now. now. It's happening now. &gt;&gt; If somebody &gt;&gt; If somebody &gt;&gt; What do you think happens to Grock 5 or &gt;&gt; What do you think happens to Grock 5 or Grock 6? Is that violating copyright? It Grock 6? Is that violating copyright? It didn't even know that it existed didn't even know that it existed &gt;&gt; on the output. Yeah, that's fine. If it &gt;&gt; on the output. Yeah, that's fine. If it on the output created a similar work, on the output created a similar work, they would need to then take it down. they would need to then take it down. And so that that would be a really And so that that would be a really interesting new that's a new space we're interesting new that's a new space we're going to have to contend with. So you going to have to contend with. So you can if it does happen is a new concept can if it does happen is a new concept that we would have to address in a new that we would have to address in a new way. I'll give you I'll give you a way. I'll give you a science corner example. There's this science corner example. There's this EVO2 model that they published at the EVO2 model that they published at the Arc Institute which Patrick Collison you Arc Institute which Patrick Collison you know is the name Sherman. know is the name Sherman. &gt;&gt; So that EVO2 model they just ingested &gt;&gt; So that EVO2 model they just ingested all the DNA data they could find in the all the DNA data they could find in the world. Trillions and trillions of base world. Trillions and trillions of base pair of data that they ingested pair of data that they ingested &gt;&gt; and then they looked at patterns in DNA &gt;&gt; and then they looked at patterns in DNA and that's it. They had no context for and that's it. They had no context for what the DNA represented. They had no what the DNA represented. They had no context for the concept of genes. none context for the concept of genes. none of the structured understanding of what of the structured understanding of what that DNA does, what it is. And you know that DNA does, what it is. And you know what it did? It fed in the BA gene what it did? It fed in the BA gene variant and the thing output a warning variant and the thing output a warning saying I think that this is a pathogenic saying I think that this is a pathogenic variant to DNA without having any variant to DNA without having any context. This is the the breast cancer context. This is the the breast cancer alil and it didn't have any knowledge alil and it didn't have any knowledge and it did it wasn't trained on that at and it did it wasn't trained on that at all. It had no knowledge that there are all. It had no knowledge that there are pathogenic variants for cancer and it pathogenic variants for cancer and it identified that this was a genetic identified that this was a genetic variant that can cause some sort of variant that can cause some sort of pathogenic outcome in the organism. So pathogenic outcome in the organism. So that was that's a great example where that was that's a great example where there's a lack of understanding at the there's a lack of understanding at the human level on what really drives some human level on what really drives some of the patterns in nature, the patterns of the patterns in nature, the patterns in society, the patterns in behavior in society, the patterns in behavior that are kind of emergent phenomena that are kind of emergent phenomena perhaps that these AI models are perhaps that these AI models are starting to identify. And I think to starting to identify. And I think to Jama's point, we may end up seeing this Jama's point, we may end up seeing this in things like entertainment as well. in things like entertainment as well. All right, this has been an amazing All right, this has been an amazing debate. We got to move on. And you know debate. We got to move on. And you know what? We're going to have more amazing what? We're going to have more amazing debates September 7th through 9th in Los debates September 7th through 9th in Los Angeles at the All-In Summit. The lineup Angeles at the All-In Summit. The lineup is stacked. Alibaba's co-founder Josai is stacked. Alibaba's co-founder Josai Tomma Bravo co-founder Arc Invest Kathy Tomma Bravo co-founder Arc Invest Kathy Wood Uber CEO Dra Sequoa's Rolaf Botha Wood Uber CEO Dra Sequoa's Rolaf Botha YouTuber Cleo Abram and many many more YouTuber Cleo Abram and many many more coming you get the last word here go coming you get the last word here go &gt;&gt; I was just highlighting this tweet that &gt;&gt; I was just highlighting this tweet that I saw I saw I saw &gt;&gt; where talking about Chinese openweight &gt;&gt; where talking about Chinese openweight models are basically open source models models are basically open source models so so so &gt;&gt; basically all the leading American &gt;&gt; basically all the leading American models are closed source and all the models are closed source and all the leading Chinese models are open source leading Chinese models are open source this is kind of the way things played this is kind of the way things played out. out. out. &gt;&gt; It's a pretty good technique for &gt;&gt; It's a pretty good technique for catching up because then you got the catching up because then you got the larger open source developer community larger open source developer community helping you out. helping you out. &gt;&gt; But the point is just that these open &gt;&gt; But the point is just that these open source models are catching up pretty source models are catching up pretty fast. We're ahead in many other aspects. fast. We're ahead in many other aspects. Our chips are a lot better. Our data Our chips are a lot better. Our data centers are better and so on. And I'd centers are better and so on. And I'd say our closed source models are better. say our closed source models are better. But they have this one area of open But they have this one area of open source models. So again, if you source models. So again, if you hamstring our AI models access to data hamstring our AI models access to data by creating a whole bunch of new by creating a whole bunch of new requirements for contract negotiations, requirements for contract negotiations, like we could really lose the AI race. like we could really lose the AI race. This is a really big deal. It's not a This is a really big deal. It's not a madeup concern. I don't know why you madeup concern. I don't know why you think it's made up. think it's made up. &gt;&gt; I never said that it's made up. I think &gt;&gt; I never said that it's made up. I think it's an opportunity for America to it's an opportunity for America to actually have a distinct advantage, actually have a distinct advantage, which is that $20 million from Amazon which is that $20 million from Amazon alone is 1% of the New York Times alone is 1% of the New York Times revenue. And that's going to go directly revenue. And that's going to go directly to the bottom line. It's going to allow to the bottom line. It's going to allow them to hire more journalists. Then that them to hire more journalists. Then that protected site will have be giving in protected site will have be giving in real time something. These language real time something. These language models are going to have to go hack and models are going to have to go hack and steal that real-time data is going to be steal that real-time data is going to be a distinct advantage for Gemini, OpenAI, a distinct advantage for Gemini, OpenAI, Amazon, whoever chooses to do it. And we Amazon, whoever chooses to do it. And we can create can create can create &gt;&gt; you have this like nostalgic sort of &gt;&gt; you have this like nostalgic sort of quasi romantic notions about like quasi romantic notions about like journalism and the need to save the New journalism and the need to save the New York Times. York Times. York Times. &gt;&gt; It's also art. It's I mean you can say &gt;&gt; It's also art. It's I mean you can say all the derogatory things you want about all the derogatory things you want about me personally, Saxs. That argument me personally, Saxs. That argument doesn't work. No, no. You just said I doesn't work. No, no. You just said I have this whole nostalgia whatever when have this whole nostalgia whatever when you you you &gt;&gt; Yeah, you do. You're nostalgic for &gt;&gt; Yeah, you do. You're nostalgic for journalism as it used to exist. journalism as it used to exist. &gt;&gt; When I know I've beat you in the debate &gt;&gt; When I know I've beat you in the debate is when you make it personal like that. is when you make it personal like that. It's not personal. I'm not being It's not personal. I'm not being nostalgic. I'm trying to create a nostalgic. I'm trying to create a sustainable a sustainable advantage for sustainable a sustainable advantage for America. And you are our public servant America. And you are our public servant and you're learning AI. You will take my and you're learning AI. You will take my feedback. feedback. feedback. &gt;&gt; You will take my feedback. &gt;&gt; You will take my feedback. &gt;&gt; We're going to ignore your feedback. &gt;&gt; We're going to ignore your feedback.

No, you take it and I will be showing up at the White and I will be showing up at the White House for my tour. House for my tour. &gt;&gt; You have this crazy idea that we're &gt;&gt; You have this crazy idea that we're going to win the AI race by tying one going to win the AI race by tying one hand behind our back so that you can hand behind our back so that you can subsidize journalists so you can subsidize journalists so you can subsidize movies. You'll get more subsidize movies. You'll get more content. You said before you want more content. You said before you want more training data, pay for it. Pay for more training data, pay for it. Pay for more training data. You're the zar. Take it training data. You're the zar. Take it back to pus. All right, let's keep back to pus. All right, let's keep moving here. moving here. moving here. &gt;&gt; We have to keep moving. We have a great &gt;&gt; We have to keep moving. We have a great This is great debate.

Not yet. But a little bit &gt;&gt; No, not yet. Not yet. But a little bit of the buting. of the buting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. Let him eat the &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

Listen, you and I, Saxs, will do more Listen, you and I, Saxs, will do more debate and it's going to be amazing. debate and it's going to be amazing. allin.com/ yada yada yada for tickets. allin.com/ yada yada yada for tickets. Get in there, folks. Uh, we have to get Get in there, folks. Uh, we have to get to the docket. We're an hour in and we to the docket. We're an hour in and we still have all the news. still have all the news. &gt;&gt; We should talk about this this um AI &gt;&gt; We should talk about this this um AI privacy issue that Sam Alman mentioned. privacy issue that Sam Alman mentioned. &gt;&gt; All right, that's a great segue cuz I &gt;&gt; All right, that's a great segue cuz I saw that as well, David Saxs, and as our saw that as well, David Saxs, and as our civil servant working on AI, this is civil servant working on AI, this is something where you can have an something where you can have an additional contribution. There's more additional contribution. There's more work we can give you. All right, listen. work we can give you. All right, listen. Here it is. AI user privacy is becoming Here it is. AI user privacy is becoming an issue because friend of the pod Sam an issue because friend of the pod Sam Alman says there is no legal Alman says there is no legal confidentiality when using his product confidentiality when using his product chat GPT. Here's a 30 secondond clip chat GPT. Here's a 30 secondond clip again. Friend of the pod fop Sam Alman again. Friend of the pod fop Sam Alman on the vaugh people talk about the most on the vaugh people talk about the most personal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in their lives to chatt personal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in their lives to chatt young people especially like use it as a young people especially like use it as a therapist a life coach uh having these therapist a life coach uh having these relationship problems. What should I do? relationship problems. What should I do? And right now, if you talk to a And right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about those problems, there's like legal those problems, there's like legal privilege for it. We haven't figured privilege for it. We haven't figured that out yet for when you talk to that out yet for when you talk to ChachiBT. So, if you go talk to CHP ChachiBT. So, if you go talk to CHP about your most sensitive stuff and then about your most sensitive stuff and then there's like a lawsuit or whatever, like there's like a lawsuit or whatever, like we could be required to produce that. we could be required to produce that. And I think that's very screwed up. I And I think that's very screwed up. I think we should have like the same think we should have like the same concept of privacy for your concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever. therapist or whatever. &gt;&gt; Okay, Saxs, this is bringing up &gt;&gt; Okay, Saxs, this is bringing up something super important. something super important. What's your take on it? What's your take on it? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I I think this is an &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I I think this is an interesting topic because like interesting topic because like copyright, this is an area where we have copyright, this is an area where we have existing law, but it does make you existing law, but it does make you rethink whether those laws are truly rethink whether those laws are truly applicable or make as much sense in this applicable or make as much sense in this new world. So, the existing law, the new world. So, the existing law, the existing example is search history. You existing example is search history. You know, the government can get a copy of know, the government can get a copy of your search history. They can subpoena your search history. They can subpoena it. it. it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every true crime story starts with &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every true crime story starts with the person's search for how do I kill my the person's search for how do I kill my husband slowly with you poison and then husband slowly with you poison and then they Yeah, that's they Yeah, that's &gt;&gt; right. Exactly. The point is though that &gt;&gt; right. Exactly. The point is though that I think Sam is right about the legal I think Sam is right about the legal treatment right now, which is that your treatment right now, which is that your chat history isn't any different than chat history isn't any different than the search history in the eyes of the the search history in the eyes of the law. But it is much more personal. It's law. But it is much more personal. It's much more interactive than your search much more interactive than your search history. You are using it like you said, history. You are using it like you said, you could use it as a as your doctor. you could use it as a as your doctor. You could use it as your therapist. You You could use it as your therapist. You could use as your lawyer. And so the could use as your lawyer. And so the ability for the federal government to be ability for the federal government to be intrusive is so much greater than with intrusive is so much greater than with your search history. So I don't know your search history. So I don't know what like the right policy should be what like the right policy should be yet, but I I will say it does make me yet, but I I will say it does make me uncomfortable. uncomfortable. uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a market. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a market. &gt;&gt; Can I make a recommendation to my AIR? &gt;&gt; Can I make a recommendation to my AIR? &gt;&gt; Yes, please. He's our &gt;&gt; Yes, please. He's our &gt;&gt; Why don't we let AI models &gt;&gt; Why don't we let AI models get bar certified and get medically get bar certified and get medically certified? So, if the AI models, it certified? So, if the AI models, it turns out, are actually proving to be turns out, are actually proving to be more accurate, more thoughtful, more accurate, more thoughtful, more responsive, more reasonable, more responsive, more reasonable, whatever it is, whatever metric we're whatever it is, whatever metric we're using, and they pass the same criteria using, and they pass the same criteria as one would need to pass to qualify for as one would need to pass to qualify for the bar or to qualify for a doctor the bar or to qualify for a doctor certificate. Why don't we do that for certificate. Why don't we do that for the AI? If that then happens, then the the AI? If that then happens, then the the same privilege occurs to the AI as the same privilege occurs to the AI as it does to the individual human that it does to the individual human that does it. And now if you extrapolate from does it. And now if you extrapolate from where that takes us, if we're suddenly where that takes us, if we're suddenly giving AI the same sort of privileged giving AI the same sort of privileged rights that we give to privileged rights that we give to privileged humans, where's that going to take us humans, where's that going to take us ultimately with respect to the overall ultimately with respect to the overall rights for AI? rights for AI? &gt;&gt; Well, and they have responsibility. Hold &gt;&gt; Well, and they have responsibility. Hold on a second. I just want to point out on a second. I just want to point out here once again, you have a mind-blowing here once again, you have a mind-blowing concept here. I've never heard anybody concept here. I've never heard anybody vocalize that. Could they actually be vocalize that. Could they actually be certified in that knowledge? And if they certified in that knowledge? And if they pass the test, makes sense they would. pass the test, makes sense they would. But then you also get responsibility. But then you also get responsibility. &gt;&gt; So with great power comes great &gt;&gt; So with great power comes great responsibility. I will tell you this. responsibility. I will tell you this. &gt;&gt; You can turn this stuff off. But this is &gt;&gt; You can turn this stuff off. But this is an opportunity. I'm going to send a note an opportunity. I'm going to send a note to you. to you. to you. &gt;&gt; And it sounds crazy today, but I &gt;&gt; And it sounds crazy today, but I guarantee if you put it on Poly Market, guarantee if you put it on Poly Market, there will be a date when this happens. there will be a date when this happens. &gt;&gt; Poly market. Shout out to Shane. Let's &gt;&gt; Poly market. Shout out to Shane. Let's get that up there. I just want to point get that up there. I just want to point out I'm going to email Elon about this out I'm going to email Elon about this when I get off the pod. when I get off the pod. &gt;&gt; This is an opportunity to create the &gt;&gt; This is an opportunity to create the signal of the signal equivalent of an signal of the signal equivalent of an LLM. The all of your chat should be LLM. The all of your chat should be encrypted. All of it should be by by encrypted. All of it should be by by default. Encrypt it by default on Grock. default. Encrypt it by default on Grock. Make it so that Grock can't even see it. Make it so that Grock can't even see it. They don't have it. So when you try to They don't have it. So when you try to subpoena it, you can do what Tim Cook subpoena it, you can do what Tim Cook does, which he says like, I don't have does, which he says like, I don't have it. You, if you want to try to back door it. You, if you want to try to back door it, you can. That's a market it, you can. That's a market opportunity. I can tell you I only use opportunity. I can tell you I only use the Brave browser and Brave search for the Brave browser and Brave search for this reason. I don't want my search this reason. I don't want my search history like saved somewhere or history like saved somewhere or whatever. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that. You can take whatever. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that. You can take control of this as an individual, but control of this as an individual, but the defaults matter and you have to then the defaults matter and you have to then do the work. It's a great market do the work. It's a great market opportunity. Chimoth, I don't even want opportunity. Chimoth, I don't even want to know what you're talking to chat GPT to know what you're talking to chat GPT about. What are you What's in your chat about. What are you What's in your chat GBT logs? GBT logs? GBT logs? What's in there, Chimoth? How to extend? What's in there, Chimoth? How to extend? How to get the extra centimeter? What's How to get the extra centimeter? What's in there? You trying to in there? You trying to What's in there? What's in there? &gt;&gt; I keep asking it to find me a moderator. &gt;&gt; I keep asking it to find me a moderator. &gt;&gt; Oh, great. I keep asking it to find me a &gt;&gt; Oh, great. I keep asking it to find me a participant who's not a douche. Um, &gt;&gt; my god, you are so deep in your villain &gt;&gt; my god, you are so deep in your villain era and you're leaning into it and I'm era and you're leaning into it and I'm so here for it, Chimat. I love your so here for it, Chimat. I love your villain. villain. villain. &gt;&gt; You know why? I am so &gt;&gt; You know why? I am so &gt;&gt; Why are you going into your villain? &gt;&gt; Why are you going into your villain? &gt;&gt; I am so riskon right now. It's like &gt;&gt; I am so riskon right now. It's like &gt;&gt; it's liberating actually. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; it's liberating actually. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; It's really amazing. &gt;&gt; It's really amazing. &gt;&gt; Is there any blowback to how outlandish &gt;&gt; Is there any blowback to how outlandish you've become this year? Any blowback at you've become this year? Any blowback at all? Has it had any negative consequence all? Has it had any negative consequence on business or hiring or anything? on business or hiring or anything? &gt;&gt; No. But but outlandish? How how have I &gt;&gt; No. But but outlandish? How how have I been outlandish? been outlandish? been outlandish? &gt;&gt; You're you're you're just filter off. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're just filter off. You're filter off. And I think it's You're filter off. And I think it's great. I think you're over two windows great. I think you're over two windows back. It's absolutely fantastic we're back. It's absolutely fantastic we're seeing here. I asked chat GPT about my seeing here. I asked chat GPT about my future and uh my IQ. It's very future and uh my IQ. It's very interesting when you ask chat GPT to interesting when you ask chat GPT to analyze you. analyze you. analyze you. &gt;&gt; I suggest everyone do it. &gt;&gt; I suggest everyone do it. &gt;&gt; Well, actually, yeah, when you just ask &gt;&gt; Well, actually, yeah, when you just ask chat GPT or whatever, what do you know chat GPT or whatever, what do you know about me? about me? about me? &gt;&gt; And it's scary how much it already does. &gt;&gt; And it's scary how much it already does. &gt;&gt; It's scary. There's this great &gt;&gt; It's scary. There's this great personality test. You can put this personality test. You can put this personality test into Grock and this guy personality test into Grock and this guy like made this prompt and it goes and it like made this prompt and it goes and it tells you all your personality based on tells you all your personality based on your Twitter ex history. It is wild how your Twitter ex history. It is wild how accurate it is. What does it say about accurate it is. What does it say about you, J? I'm actually curious. you, J? I'm actually curious. &gt;&gt; It says the same thing about all of us. &gt;&gt; It says the same thing about all of us. We're all likeworked We're all likeworked narcissist, ENTJ. You can literally run narcissist, ENTJ. You can literally run the MyersBriggs against your the MyersBriggs against your &gt;&gt; Yeah, your chat history. It's actually &gt;&gt; Yeah, your chat history. It's actually But I I like your mind-blowing concept But I I like your mind-blowing concept there, by the way, of like them becoming there, by the way, of like them becoming certified in some way. Okay, fresh certified in some way. Okay, fresh economic news. It's time for the economic news. It's time for the administration to take their victory administration to take their victory lap. GDP growth was 50% higher than lap. GDP growth was 50% higher than expectations in Q2 as the Fed held rates expectations in Q2 as the Fed held rates at 4.25%. In Q1, GDP declined 50 basis at 4.25%. In Q1, GDP declined 50 basis points. That's probably due to the points. That's probably due to the imports. People were stockpiling goods. imports. People were stockpiling goods. &gt;&gt; That's the most pointless chart ever. &gt;&gt; That's the most pointless chart ever. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then Yeah, it is. I agree. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then Yeah, it is. I agree. It's a little bit Yeah, It's a little bit Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's distorted by I wanted to have both. &gt;&gt; it's distorted by I wanted to have both. I wanted to have both as bar charts. I wanted to have both as bar charts. This one This one This one &gt;&gt; totally on drugs. Just say it. It's &gt;&gt; totally on drugs. Just say it. It's okay. okay. okay. &gt;&gt; What drugs are you on? I'm not I had &gt;&gt; What drugs are you on? I'm not I had coffee and now I'm out. I'm out. coffee and now I'm out. I'm out. &gt;&gt; We're all friends. You can tell us. Is &gt;&gt; We're all friends. You can tell us. Is it really just out? it really just out? &gt;&gt; All right, that's it. I'm taking it out. &gt;&gt; All right, that's it. I'm taking it out. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I took it out. And now let's get back to &gt;&gt; I took it out. And now let's get back to the here. Okay. The Fed kept rates the here. Okay. The Fed kept rates unchanged for the fifth straight unchanged for the fifth straight meeting. This time, two out of 11 Fed meeting. This time, two out of 11 Fed governors desented from Pal's decision. governors desented from Pal's decision. Two of the dissenters were both Two of the dissenters were both Republicans nominated by Trump. So, it Republicans nominated by Trump. So, it seems like the Fed is becoming a little seems like the Fed is becoming a little polarized now, too. First time in 32 polarized now, too. First time in 32 years that more than one governor years that more than one governor dissented. And um yeah, even one person dissented. And um yeah, even one person dissenting is rare. Here's a 25-second dissenting is rare. Here's a 25-second clip of Pal explaining how GDP factored clip of Pal explaining how GDP factored into the cut decision. Nick, please play into the cut decision. Nick, please play the clip. Recent indicators suggest that the clip. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has growth of economic activity has moderated. GDP rose at a 1.2% pace in moderated. GDP rose at a 1.2% pace in the first half of this year, down from the first half of this year, down from 2.5% last year. Although the increase in 2.5% last year. Although the increase in the second quarter was stronger at 3%, the second quarter was stronger at 3%, focusing on the first half of the year focusing on the first half of the year helps smooth through the volatility in helps smooth through the volatility in the quarterly figures related to the the quarterly figures related to the unusual swings in net exports. The PCE unusual swings in net exports. The PCE index and then I'll throw this over to index and then I'll throw this over to you Sax for for the official position you Sax for for the official position here for June dropped on Thursday. PC is here for June dropped on Thursday. PC is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation over CPI. PCE rose 30 bips in June in over CPI. PCE rose 30 bips in June in line with estimates and um if you line with estimates and um if you remember we talked about in a previous remember we talked about in a previous episode CPI rose a bit 13% or 30 bips episode CPI rose a bit 13% or 30 bips from May to June. So, we're not any from May to June. So, we're not any we're not close to the 2% uh target and we're not close to the 2% uh target and that's what the Fed keeps saying. We're that's what the Fed keeps saying. We're not there yet. And the economy is al not there yet. And the economy is al fuego saxs. You note I don't know if you fuego saxs. You note I don't know if you noticed this, but people are talking noticed this, but people are talking about the QDP the second quarter print about the QDP the second quarter print which was amazing for GDP. You were which was amazing for GDP. You were talking about it a bunch on the socials. talking about it a bunch on the socials. He keeps referencing the first half. So, He keeps referencing the first half. So, he's trying to blend those two together, he's trying to blend those two together, I think, because of the the tariff I think, because of the the tariff differences or, you know, maybe to to differences or, you know, maybe to to smooth it out as he said. What's your smooth it out as he said. What's your take on this? The GDP boomed in, you take on this? The GDP boomed in, you know, 3% which is pretty great. know, 3% which is pretty great. &gt;&gt; The problem No, the problem that Jerome &gt;&gt; The problem No, the problem that Jerome Powell has is that he's trying to smooth Powell has is that he's trying to smooth it because it allows him to justify his it because it allows him to justify his political decision. political decision. political decision. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But the reason why you have to segregate &gt;&gt; But the reason why you have to segregate Q1 and Q2, Q1 was before tariffs and Q2 Q1 and Q2, Q1 was before tariffs and Q2 was after tariffs. So I think you have was after tariffs. So I think you have to segregate these two things. And if to segregate these two things. And if you look at the run rate from Q2, what you look at the run rate from Q2, what you're probably going to see in Q3 and you're probably going to see in Q3 and beyond is more similar to Q2, which is beyond is more similar to Q2, which is to say a large surplus, good GDP to say a large surplus, good GDP expansion, expansion, expansion, and moderating inflation. So why does and moderating inflation. So why does the Fed not cut? Because at this point, the Fed not cut? Because at this point, not cutting is the only thing that you not cutting is the only thing that you can do to slow the Trump administration can do to slow the Trump administration down going into the midterms if you down going into the midterms if you wanted to politicize the job. wanted to politicize the job. If, however, on the other hand, you just If, however, on the other hand, you just take the data as is and you ignore Q1 take the data as is and you ignore Q1 because it was pre-tariff and you start because it was pre-tariff and you start to look at Q2 and you project forward, to look at Q2 and you project forward, if you inject a 100 basis point cut into if you inject a 100 basis point cut into the economy, this thing is going to go the economy, this thing is going to go gang busters and Trump is going to look gang busters and Trump is going to look like an economic genius going into 2026. like an economic genius going into 2026. So I think that again in the absence of So I think that again in the absence of politics you cut politics you cut &gt;&gt; Okay. Sachs, what's the take from inside &gt;&gt; Okay. Sachs, what's the take from inside the administration and around it? I know the administration and around it? I know you're you're not speaking for the you're you're not speaking for the president on this issue, but you're in president on this issue, but you're in the administration, so I'm assuming the administration, so I'm assuming you're you're you're &gt;&gt; Look, I'm not speaking for anyone, but &gt;&gt; Look, I'm not speaking for anyone, but obviously the 3% number is way ahead of obviously the 3% number is way ahead of expectations. It's a fantastic number. expectations. It's a fantastic number. It just feels like, you know, It just feels like, you know, everything's humming on all cylinders everything's humming on all cylinders here. One thing you didn't mention, but here. One thing you didn't mention, but I think is relevant, is the new trade I think is relevant, is the new trade deal with the EU. deal with the EU. &gt;&gt; We're about to get to that, by the way. &gt;&gt; We're about to get to that, by the way. That's the next story. That's the next story. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Well, I mean, I would include &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Well, I mean, I would include that because that because that because &gt;&gt; Okay, include it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay, include it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it was a deal that just &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it was a deal that just got announced where the EU is going to got announced where the EU is going to open its markets to US products. No open its markets to US products. No tariff on US products, but they will pay tariff on US products, but they will pay a 15% tariff coming into the US. They're a 15% tariff coming into the US. They're going to be investing 600 billion in the going to be investing 600 billion in the US. They're going to be buying 750 US. They're going to be buying 750 billion of US energy. and then some very billion of US energy. and then some very large number I guess they didn't specify large number I guess they didn't specify number on defense products basically number on defense products basically American military products hundreds of American military products hundreds of billions which is the followup to their billions which is the followup to their commitment to raise their contribution commitment to raise their contribution to NATO to 5% of GDP up from I guess it to NATO to 5% of GDP up from I guess it was sort of like 2% before was sort of like 2% before &gt;&gt; so I mean this is a huge deal for the &gt;&gt; so I mean this is a huge deal for the United States I think it's a huge win United States I think it's a huge win for the Trump administration and the for the Trump administration and the deal is so good that what I'm seeing deal is so good that what I'm seeing from European sources on X European from European sources on X European publications just commenters is that publications just commenters is that they they were like outraged. They felt they they were like outraged. They felt like they got taken to the cleaners like they got taken to the cleaners here. here. here. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; you see you see a lot of that on X by &gt;&gt; you see you see a lot of that on X by European side. A lot of the European European side. A lot of the European leaders are saying that Ursula chickened leaders are saying that Ursula chickened out. So, you know, all those stupid taco out. So, you know, all those stupid taco memes are going away now because people memes are going away now because people are realizing that are realizing that Trump's willingness to raise tariffs on Trump's willingness to raise tariffs on these countries as a threat to these countries as a threat to renegotiate better trade deals is renegotiate better trade deals is working. It's working extraordinarily working. It's working extraordinarily well. Just this EU deal, one way to well. Just this EU deal, one way to think about it is you add it all up, think about it is you add it all up, it's about $2 trillion. It's effectively it's about $2 trillion. It's effectively $2 trillion of stimulus into the US, but $2 trillion of stimulus into the US, but without money printing. without money printing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Over the next three years. So it's &gt;&gt; Yeah. Over the next three years. So it's not inflationary. not inflationary. not inflationary. &gt;&gt; It's not insignificant. Freedberg, your &gt;&gt; It's not insignificant. Freedberg, your thoughts on the Fed, the GDP print, and thoughts on the Fed, the GDP print, and then maybe you could get into the then maybe you could get into the granular granular granular details of that print. If you pull up details of that print. If you pull up the schedule of data, so this is the the schedule of data, so this is the national income and product accounts national income and product accounts data from the Bureau of Economic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So this is where the inflation Analysis. So this is where the inflation print comes from. I think there are two print comes from. I think there are two lines worth taking significant note of. lines worth taking significant note of. The first is the furnishings and durable The first is the furnishings and durable household equipment line. So in June, household equipment line. So in June, the cost for furnishings and household the cost for furnishings and household stuff jumped 1.3% month over month on an stuff jumped 1.3% month over month on an annualized basis, right? That's almost annualized basis, right? That's almost 15% year-over-year if it were to 15% year-over-year if it were to continue at that level. And then the continue at that level. And then the second one is this recreational goods second one is this recreational goods and vehicles that jumped 9% month over and vehicles that jumped 9% month over month. Neither of those categories have month. Neither of those categories have jumped that much in in kind of recent jumped that much in in kind of recent history. So part of the argument that's history. So part of the argument that's being made is that what we are seeing in being made is that what we are seeing in these jumps is actually some of the these jumps is actually some of the first effects of the tariffs and the first effects of the tariffs and the cost of goods that are being imported cost of goods that are being imported because these are largely imports having because these are largely imports having an adverse effect on the consumer. And an adverse effect on the consumer. And so I think this is kind of a wait andsee so I think this is kind of a wait andsee moment on some of these categories that moment on some of these categories that are predicted to have a tariff price are predicted to have a tariff price effect starting to show through. So I effect starting to show through. So I think this is where a lot of folks are think this is where a lot of folks are keeping a close eye on and it kind of keeping a close eye on and it kind of provides a little bit of the support for provides a little bit of the support for the economists that are saying we should the economists that are saying we should keep rates steady because if we are keep rates steady because if we are seeing a significant inflationary effect seeing a significant inflationary effect here it's worth noting that there's here it's worth noting that there's something that we need to be thoughtful something that we need to be thoughtful about rate policy. about rate policy. &gt;&gt; I think this is um a really good point. &gt;&gt; I think this is um a really good point. If you look in this debate, which is If you look in this debate, which is obviously highly political, obviously highly political, we're at inflation 2.567%. Spending is increasing. Obviously, stock Spending is increasing. Obviously, stock market at an all-time high. Unemployment market at an all-time high. Unemployment trending down again. So, we're at like trending down again. So, we're at like 4.1%. 4.1%. 4.1%. And people are just yoloing into crypto And people are just yoloing into crypto and they're doing sports betting. and they're doing sports betting. Bitcoin at an all-time high. I think the Bitcoin at an all-time high. I think the Fed now is in a position where cutting Fed now is in a position where cutting rates seems like putting kerosene on the rates seems like putting kerosene on the fire. If Trump fire. If Trump tanked the economy in Q2, he probably tanked the economy in Q2, he probably would have gotten the rates. But now I would have gotten the rates. But now I don't think it's reasonable, as you're don't think it's reasonable, as you're saying, Dave, the the reasons to not cut saying, Dave, the the reasons to not cut are building because the economy is on are building because the economy is on fire. So maybe the shock and bore fire. So maybe the shock and bore approach to tariffs, which is now approach to tariffs, which is now becoming a playbook. I had a nice talk becoming a playbook. I had a nice talk with Lutnik about this, who I love, by with Lutnik about this, who I love, by the way. He really described to me how the way. He really described to me how they're doing these. And the shock and they're doing these. And the shock and bore playbook is basically Trump says bore playbook is basically Trump says something completely outrageous, something completely outrageous, shocking, everybody goes crazy, the shocking, everybody goes crazy, the media loses their mind, business leaders media loses their mind, business leaders lose their mind. Lutick told me that lose their mind. Lutick told me that what he does is he sets the table and what he does is he sets the table and proposes something reasonable because, proposes something reasonable because, you know, now I'm a big, you know, you know, now I'm a big, you know, direct contact with all the direct contact with all the administration. Sax, thank you for that. administration. Sax, thank you for that. Um, Um, Um, and he described it. Trump comes in, and he described it. Trump comes in, sees all the stuff, and then he starts sees all the stuff, and then he starts making these micro tweaks. So it's on making these micro tweaks. So it's on the finish line. It's in the red zone, 5 the finish line. It's in the red zone, 5 yard line. Trump comes in and then he yard line. Trump comes in and then he sticks it to them again with three or sticks it to them again with three or four extra asks and then they wrap it up four extra asks and then they wrap it up and that this is becoming really and that this is becoming really effective. So it was chaotic at first. effective. So it was chaotic at first. It seemed nonsensical, but they've put It seemed nonsensical, but they've put the Fed in a really bad position because the Fed in a really bad position because they never seen this before. They've they never seen this before. They've never seen this before. So now they're never seen this before. So now they're going to be in this defensive position going to be in this defensive position of what if we cut it and the market of what if we cut it and the market rips. To your point, Chimoff, you just rips. To your point, Chimoff, you just said the market will rip the second they said the market will rip the second they cut that. And the cynical view of this cut that. And the cynical view of this is the market rips as we go into the is the market rips as we go into the midterms, which is the same claim the midterms, which is the same claim the Republicans made about the cuts that Republicans made about the cuts that Biden did in September right before the Biden did in September right before the election. So, there is some level of election. So, there is some level of politics and gamesmanship going on here. politics and gamesmanship going on here. But you have to hand it to the Trump But you have to hand it to the Trump administration for what they're doing administration for what they're doing with this sort of 2.0 playbook. If this with this sort of 2.0 playbook. If this was Sachs premeditated and we all just was Sachs premeditated and we all just didn't understand it, fine. didn't understand it, fine. The outcome here is The outcome here is this administration has to live or die this administration has to live or die by the results of these 600 billion from by the results of these 600 billion from the EU, 550 billion in investment from the EU, 550 billion in investment from Japan. You put those two together, I Japan. You put those two together, I asked Lutnik, is that at the event, is asked Lutnik, is that at the event, is that going into the sovereign wealth that going into the sovereign wealth fund? And how does that get, you know, fund? And how does that get, you know, spent? And he said at the discretion of spent? And he said at the discretion of the president and he's advising him to the president and he's advising him to spend it on putting more nukes in. So spend it on putting more nukes in. So that's fascinating. We have a trillion that's fascinating. We have a trillion dollars now that we can put into nuclear dollars now that we can put into nuclear power plants and these small module power plants and these small module reactors. And that's what Lutnik said he reactors. And that's what Lutnik said he wanted to spend it on. He's going to wanted to spend it on. He's going to advise the president to spend it on. But advise the president to spend it on. But now we've got them investing in our now we've got them investing in our country. It's absolutely brilliant. If country. It's absolutely brilliant. If it works out, we'll see if it works out. it works out, we'll see if it works out. &gt;&gt; April 2nd was liberation day and the &gt;&gt; April 2nd was liberation day and the media went crazy. They were predicting a media went crazy. They were predicting a black Monday. The market crash. They black Monday. The market crash. They basically tried to spook the markets and basically tried to spook the markets and create fear. They said that we're going create fear. They said that we're going to go into a recession or depression. to go into a recession or depression. And now look at where we are. It's just And now look at where we are. It's just a few months later. All the markets are a few months later. All the markets are at all-time highs. Trump has extracted at all-time highs. Trump has extracted trillions of dollars in these trade trillions of dollars in these trade deals that people know. deals that people know. &gt;&gt; Premeditated. Tell us the truth. &gt;&gt; Premeditated. Tell us the truth. &gt;&gt; Premeditated. &gt;&gt; Premeditated. &gt;&gt; Premeditated. &gt;&gt; Hold on. President Trump has extracted &gt;&gt; Hold on. President Trump has extracted trillions of dollars from other trillions of dollars from other countries using powers that other countries using powers that other presidents didn't even know they had. presidents didn't even know they had. &gt;&gt; 100% 100%. Was it premeditated? Cuz it &gt;&gt; 100% 100%. Was it premeditated? Cuz it was chaotic. the market did the market% was chaotic. the market did the market% moves because of the media by the way moves because of the media by the way those moves because they were scared those moves because they were scared &gt;&gt; and we just had a 3% GDP growth &gt;&gt; and we just had a 3% GDP growth &gt;&gt; print &gt;&gt; print &gt;&gt; print how things could be how things could be &gt;&gt; what I think happened is that President &gt;&gt; what I think happened is that President Trump saw an opportunity here that other Trump saw an opportunity here that other people ignored it's like when a CEO people ignored it's like when a CEO comes in to a company a new CEO comes in comes in to a company a new CEO comes in and that company's been mismanaged for a and that company's been mismanaged for a decade but it's got wonderful assets on decade but it's got wonderful assets on its balance sheet it's got a market its balance sheet it's got a market position that's still very strong has position that's still very strong has been underutilized. And he came in and been underutilized. And he came in and understood that the United States had understood that the United States had tremendous leverage in all these trade tremendous leverage in all these trade negotiations. Actually, they weren't negotiations. Actually, they weren't even trade negotiations then, in all even trade negotiations then, in all these trade relationships. And he was these trade relationships. And he was able to essentially renegotiate all of able to essentially renegotiate all of them. And look at the results. I mean, them. And look at the results. I mean, they're just staggering. And you know, they're just staggering. And you know, everyone said that, "Oh, Trump's going everyone said that, "Oh, Trump's going to chicken out. He's not going to hang to chicken out. He's not going to hang tough." It's all these other countries tough." It's all these other countries that have folded like, I don't know, that have folded like, I don't know, lawn chairs. I mean, they have all lawn chairs. I mean, they have all capitulated. capitulated. capitulated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they follow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they follow. &gt;&gt; It's really remarkable. &gt;&gt; It's really remarkable. &gt;&gt; But you're not answering my question. &gt;&gt; But you're not answering my question. Was this premeditated? Give us some Was this premeditated? Give us some insight here. insight here. insight here. &gt;&gt; I don't know what this is. What are you &gt;&gt; I don't know what this is. What are you talking about? talking about? talking about? &gt;&gt; When they came out and they was like, &gt;&gt; When they came out and they was like, "Oh, 100% tariffs, 200% tariff." The "Oh, 100% tariffs, 200% tariff." The market was not making that reaction market was not making that reaction based upon the media. They were making based upon the media. They were making it based on Trump was saying. So, was it it based on Trump was saying. So, was it premeditated this shock and bore shock premeditated this shock and bore shock and reasonable negotiating strategy or and reasonable negotiating strategy or do you not know? Well, you're not privy do you not know? Well, you're not privy to Look, I'm not speaking as an insider to Look, I'm not speaking as an insider here, but we said at the time that all here, but we said at the time that all of that was happening and Larry Summers of that was happening and Larry Summers was on the pod preaching doom is that was on the pod preaching doom is that all of that was an opening bid. It was all of that was an opening bid. It was all a start to a negotiation and we had all a start to a negotiation and we had to see where it ended up and that the to see where it ended up and that the administration still had to stick the administration still had to stick the landing. landing. landing. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; but I got to say based on &gt;&gt; but I got to say based on &gt;&gt; EU, Japan, and South Korea, I mean, this &gt;&gt; EU, Japan, and South Korea, I mean, this is looking really good right now. is looking really good right now. &gt;&gt; Well, listen, it's the top five that are &gt;&gt; Well, listen, it's the top five that are like 90% of the negotiation. As Trump like 90% of the negotiation. As Trump said, there was another little note he said, there was another little note he did in the keynote when he kind of did in the keynote when he kind of drifted into his, you know, different drifted into his, you know, different things he wanted to talk about where he things he wanted to talk about where he said, "I don't even need to know about said, "I don't even need to know about the bottom countries. I've never even the bottom countries. I've never even heard that names of some of these heard that names of some of these countries." He's just got to nail the countries." He's just got to nail the what, the top five, the top 10, and what, the top five, the top 10, and we're done. And this administration has we're done. And this administration has to stick the landing as well because to stick the landing as well because these are handshake deals right now. these are handshake deals right now. They have to be inked. They have to be They have to be inked. They have to be approved. So, there's there's a lot more approved. So, there's there's a lot more work left to be done. But I said as work left to be done. But I said as well, there's one other piece of it. We well, there's one other piece of it. We talked about the the um talked about the the um &gt;&gt; you know the fact that Europe has 0% &gt;&gt; you know the fact that Europe has 0% tariffs on American products but but tariffs on American products but but even after this deal even after this deal &gt;&gt; that the European products into coming &gt;&gt; that the European products into coming into the US will have a 15% tariff and into the US will have a 15% tariff and we're not including the $600 billion of we're not including the $600 billion of European investment in the US. We're not European investment in the US. We're not including the 750 billion of sales of including the 750 billion of sales of American energy to Europe. Okay, just American energy to Europe. Okay, just talk about the tariff that 15% and what talk about the tariff that 15% and what we're seeing now across the board is we're seeing now across the board is generating about 300 billion a year of generating about 300 billion a year of additional tariff revenue that goes to additional tariff revenue that goes to help balancing the budget. help balancing the budget. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So 300 billion a year over 10 years is 3 &gt;&gt; So 300 billion a year over 10 years is 3 trillion. That is a big number. trillion. That is a big number. &gt;&gt; It's incredible. Yeah. It's got to &gt;&gt; It's incredible. Yeah. It's got to &gt;&gt; I don't know if that that completely &gt;&gt; I don't know if that that completely satisfies Freeberg, but that's a big satisfies Freeberg, but that's a big help. help. help. &gt;&gt; Freeberg, do you think that there is a &gt;&gt; Freeberg, do you think that there is a chance that inflation is going to tick chance that inflation is going to tick up because of all this? like this is a up because of all this? like this is a lot of money being pushed into the lot of money being pushed into the system again. So, could we see a system again. So, could we see a three-handle on inflation in the next 6 three-handle on inflation in the next 6 months or what's the probability of that months or what's the probability of that in your mind? in your mind? &gt;&gt; That's the big concern everybody has. &gt;&gt; That's the big concern everybody has. &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't know. I think the the big question if you look I think the the big question if you look at each of these categories, one way to at each of these categories, one way to think about it is how much margin is the think about it is how much margin is the seller making? seller making? seller making? &gt;&gt; If they're making 30% margin and we &gt;&gt; If they're making 30% margin and we charge a 15% tariff, does their margin charge a 15% tariff, does their margin go down to 15%. or do they take their go down to 15%. or do they take their margin down to 20% and raise the price margin down to 20% and raise the price by 5%. What's the right balance? And by 5%. What's the right balance? And what will happen is that now with this what will happen is that now with this effective you know tariff which is a effective you know tariff which is a sort of tax on the system a tax on the sort of tax on the system a tax on the market will find its kind of new market will find its kind of new equilibrium where the buyers are willing equilibrium where the buyers are willing to pay X and the sellers are willing to to pay X and the sellers are willing to sell it Y and I think every market's sell it Y and I think every market's going to be a bit different. So I think going to be a bit different. So I think in some of these categories we will see in some of these categories we will see significant inflation where there is a significant inflation where there is a very thin margin that the seller has in very thin margin that the seller has in selling and in some of the categories selling and in some of the categories where there's a monopoly and they have a where there's a monopoly and they have a big margin they're going to eat it big margin they're going to eat it because they don't want to have because they don't want to have competition and they don't want to see competition and they don't want to see pricing competition emerge. So I think pricing competition emerge. So I think we'll see it vary by category and you we'll see it vary by category and you know we'll see how it goes. All right know we'll see how it goes. All right listen this has been another amazing listen this has been another amazing amazing episode of the number one amazing episode of the number one podcast in the world according to Jensen podcast in the world according to Jensen Wong from Nvidia and me and uh great job Wong from Nvidia and me and uh great job everybody.
