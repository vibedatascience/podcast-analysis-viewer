Sean and Amanda return to continue their yearlong project of listing the 25 best movies of the 21st century so far. Today they discuss one of the greatest sports movies of all time: Bennett Miller's ‘Moneyball’—starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. They explore the film’s very curious production history with director Steven Soderbergh, share why they think this was the best performance of Pitt’s career, and examine what the movie’s legacy is considering Miller’s lack of work following its release.

The the book itself is baseball. The the book itself is fantastic. It's like a genuine page fantastic. It's like a genuine page turner. It kind of reads like a thriller turner. It kind of reads like a thriller even though it's covering sport sports even though it's covering sport sports events that most people who are reading events that most people who are reading the book already knew occurred. the book already knew occurred. &gt;&gt; The other thing about the the movie and &gt;&gt; The other thing about the the movie and the book is that, the book is that, &gt;&gt; you know, it's largely chronicling a &gt;&gt; you know, it's largely chronicling a kind of modest success at best, but kind of modest success at best, but basically it's another story about a basically it's another story about a loser. We just did inside Luen Davis in loser. We just did inside Luen Davis in this series, which was a story about this series, which was a story about somebody who doesn't quite fulfill his somebody who doesn't quite fulfill his promise and become as famous as he hopes promise and become as famous as he hopes to become. to become. to become. Billy Bean still has not won a World Billy Bean still has not won a World Series. He's no longer the general Series.

In fact, the A's don't even play in Oakland anymore. Oakland anymore. Oakland anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And weirdly, this movie still has this &gt;&gt; And weirdly, this movie still has this incredible sentimental hold on us.

Yeah. Um, the other thing that's interesting Um, the other thing that's interesting about it as a sports movie is about it as a sports movie is &gt;&gt; uh the big game is just like a winning &gt;&gt; uh the big game is just like a winning streak game in the middle of the season. streak game in the middle of the season. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's no dramatic playoff moment where &gt;&gt; There's no dramatic playoff moment where they're in the World Series. They don't they're in the World Series. They don't even make it to the World Series, you even make it to the World Series, you know, and there are sports movies and know, and there are sports movies and baseball movies that have done that baseball movies that have done that before, like, you know, Major League before, like, you know, Major League famously doesn't end with winning the famously doesn't end with winning the World Series. But World Series. But the movie almost doesn't care if you the movie almost doesn't care if you don't get that. It's not really don't get that. It's not really ultimately interested in that idea of ultimately interested in that idea of success. It's about the idea of it's success. It's about the idea of it's about the whether the success of the about the whether the success of the idea happens. The idea of like changing idea happens. The idea of like changing the way that people think about the way that people think about something that feels like dogmatic and something that feels like dogmatic and systematic and breaking that down too, systematic and breaking that down too, which is pretty heady for a for a which is pretty heady for a for a mainstream September release starring mainstream September release starring Brad Pitt. I give them an incredible Brad Pitt. I give them an incredible amount of credit for amount of credit for &gt;&gt; to quote Billy Bean, it has to mean &gt;&gt; to quote Billy Bean, it has to mean something. But in terms of the actual something. But in terms of the actual baseball, it you really you only see the baseball, it you really you only see the moments of failure throughout the movie moments of failure throughout the movie with the with the exception of the with the with the exception of the Hatterburg home run. But even even that Hatterburg home run. But even even that streak, I guess, you know, they recreate streak, I guess, you know, they recreate and kind of put together some archival and kind of put together some archival of of certain wins or victories or, you of of certain wins or victories or, you know, signs in the stands, but you don't know, signs in the stands, but you don't see the 11 runs that they score. You see the 11 runs that they score. You don't see those first three innings. don't see those first three innings. only you sit through the like very only you sit through the like very punishing at like error after error punishing at like error after error after error. And the movie really is after error. And the movie really is more interested in the failure in the more interested in the failure in the not quite getting there or you know what not quite getting there or you know what is what are we trying to get out of this is what are we trying to get out of this or how how can we punish you? It is like or how how can we punish you? It is like people are very mad in this movie most people are very mad in this movie most of the time. of the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think there's something to &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think there's something to um the idea of being obsessed with your um the idea of being obsessed with your job job job &gt;&gt; and thinking that there is an inherent &gt;&gt; and thinking that there is an inherent moral value in the work that you're moral value in the work that you're doing, even if you're what you're doing doing, even if you're what you're doing is kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] entertainment. I I is kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] entertainment. I I don't relate to this at all. Um don't relate to this at all. Um I it's amazing I can even enjoy this I it's amazing I can even enjoy this movie with that as one of its core movie with that as one of its core ideas. But like you can tell there are ideas. But like you can tell there are many shots of Brad Pitt looking into the many shots of Brad Pitt looking into the middle distance middle distance middle distance &gt;&gt; pondering his lost fate. &gt;&gt; pondering his lost fate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which sounds really boring. &gt;&gt; Which sounds really boring. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And so is it why do you think that's it &gt;&gt; And so is it why do you think that's it is it effectively works? is it effectively works? &gt;&gt; Well, it's it's a good face, you know, &gt;&gt; Well, it's it's a good face, you know, and I let's be real. I that I've and I let's be real. I that I've slandered the pants, but everything else slandered the pants, but everything else is working well. But I is working well. But I understatement um I think it's his best understatement um I think it's his best performance and I think that some of it performance and I think that some of it is that it does not ask him to speak as is that it does not ask him to speak as much as some other movies do and he is much as some other movies do and he is very good at reacting or he's very good very good at reacting or he's very good at looking um pissed or looking uh like at looking um pissed or looking uh like regretful or looking just like he would regretful or looking just like he would like to be somewhere else. Uh unless like to be somewhere else. Uh unless he's eating a Twinkie. Um, he's eating a Twinkie. Um, and and and you know, we talk about all the time you know, we talk about all the time that that like movie star thing that you that that like movie star thing that you can't that he holds the frame. But this can't that he holds the frame. But this movie opens movie opens movie opens with a bunch of footage, old footage with a bunch of footage, old footage from the playoffs and then him sitting from the playoffs and then him sitting alone in a stadium just turning a radio alone in a stadium just turning a radio on and on and it is riveting and it's on and on and it is riveting and it's just because just because just because he can he can hold the frame and he also he can he can hold the frame and he also I think found the right role in this of I think found the right role in this of someone who is emotionally repressed has someone who is emotionally repressed has a lot of things that he would like to a lot of things that he would like to change about his change about his And um and and is also pretty physical. And um and and is also pretty physical. Like it's he doesn't have to play Like it's he doesn't have to play baseball in this, but it is very baseball in this, but it is very athletic. He's throwing stuff around a athletic. He's throwing stuff around a lot in it. And that is a good match for lot in it. And that is a good match for Pit as well. And a good match for the Pit as well. And a good match for the movie. movie. movie. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That Gatorade cooler takes a &gt;&gt; Yeah. That Gatorade cooler takes a beating in that scene. I beating in that scene. I &gt;&gt; mean, the desk. &gt;&gt; mean, the desk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um incredible supporting cast in &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um incredible supporting cast in this movie. Some of you may recall Jonah this movie. Some of you may recall Jonah Hill was not a dramatic actor as far as Hill was not a dramatic actor as far as we knew before this movie. um easily we knew before this movie. um easily best known as kind of an appet player best known as kind of an appet player off the huge success of Superb Bad and off the huge success of Superb Bad and he was Academy Award nominated for this he was Academy Award nominated for this role. He's a very unlikely person to be role. He's a very unlikely person to be cast in this role in part because if cast in this role in part because if you've ever seen Paul Dodesta, you know you've ever seen Paul Dodesta, you know he's like a very tall skinny guy and in he's like a very tall skinny guy and in the version that Steven Soderberg was the version that Steven Soderberg was going to make Demetri Martin the going to make Demetri Martin the comedian was going to play the Peter comedian was going to play the Peter Brand character. Brand character. Brand character. &gt;&gt; So Jonah is a really like a pretty hard &gt;&gt; So Jonah is a really like a pretty hard pivot away from what they were doing pivot away from what they were doing there. But I think his comic timing there. But I think his comic timing mixed with a kind of like glazed over mixed with a kind of like glazed over sincerity that he applies to this is sincerity that he applies to this is like really helps the movie because Pit like really helps the movie because Pit really needs a foil cuz he's so really needs a foil cuz he's so restrained in his performance except restrained in his performance except when he's throwing things that he needs when he's throwing things that he needs somebody who can like give him comic somebody who can like give him comic timing, give him something to bounce off timing, give him something to bounce off of constantly. of constantly. of constantly. &gt;&gt; And and they're well matched. They &gt;&gt; And and they're well matched. They respond to each other and and you can respond to each other and and you can watch Pit. I don't know whether he's watch Pit. I don't know whether he's just like being entertained by Jonah or just like being entertained by Jonah or whether you know that is just really whether you know that is just really good acting. He's a pretty good actor. good acting. He's a pretty good actor. But you can see in the moment that I But you can see in the moment that I mean the movie is a little bit about mean the movie is a little bit about them figuring out you know their little them figuring out you know their little their relationship and and their mission their relationship and and their mission together as well as whatever it is with together as well as whatever it is with his daughter. So they yeah they play off his daughter. So they yeah they play off each other and he's just also very each other and he's just also very funny. So, Philip Seenor Hoffman, who funny. So, Philip Seenor Hoffman, who plays Art How, who also managed the plays Art How, who also managed the Mets, by the way, and he sucked. Um, Mets, by the way, and he sucked. Um, he Hoffman had had acted in Capot, he Hoffman had had acted in Capot, Bennett Miller's first narrative feature Bennett Miller's first narrative feature film, and won an Academy Award for best film, and won an Academy Award for best actor for that role. And this is kind of actor for that role. And this is kind of a small role, kind of a nothing part on a small role, kind of a nothing part on the page if you're not Philip Seymour the page if you're not Philip Seymour Hoffman. And he brings a tremendous Hoffman. And he brings a tremendous amount of gravitas. And he looks like a amount of gravitas. And he looks like a baseball manager. baseball manager. baseball manager. manag pit like he is not in intimidated by him pit like he is not in intimidated by him and there are a lot of scenes where they and there are a lot of scenes where they really have to openly have share really have to openly have share contempt for one another. contempt for one another. &gt;&gt; You are outside your mind. &gt;&gt; You are outside your mind. Um, and I love the series of Um, and I love the series of confrontations that are written for them confrontations that are written for them because because because &gt;&gt; Pit is playing a ver playing a version &gt;&gt; Pit is playing a ver playing a version of himself, an an overconfident movie of himself, an an overconfident movie star and how is a overweight manager and star and how is a overweight manager and the cheapest team in the Major League the cheapest team in the Major League Baseball. And they have like an unusual Baseball. And they have like an unusual anti-chemistry that I think is like one anti-chemistry that I think is like one of the rare aspects of tension in the of the rare aspects of tension in the movie. There's actually not a lot of movie. There's actually not a lot of ultimate tension that isn't internal, ultimate tension that isn't internal, that isn't born of like, can Billy do that isn't born of like, can Billy do it?

But, you know, as devoted as I am guess. But, you know, as devoted as I am to the Steven Soderberg project, I am I to the Steven Soderberg project, I am I am happy that we got the movie that we am happy that we got the movie that we got. got. got. &gt;&gt; The thing that's fascinating about it is &gt;&gt; The thing that's fascinating about it is that Bennett Miller is hired after that Bennett Miller is hired after Sorcin completes a draft and Bennett Sorcin completes a draft and Bennett Miller to that point had made a Miller to that point had made a documentary called The Cruise. How many documentary called The Cruise. How many people have seen The Cruise? Are you people have seen The Cruise? Are you familiar with that movie? Speed Levich, familiar with that movie? Speed Levich, who was featured in uh Richard Linklader who was featured in uh Richard Linklader movies. Um, it follows him and then he movies. Um, it follows him and then he made Capot uh which was written by his made Capot uh which was written by his friend Dan Futterman. And then he gets friend Dan Futterman. And then he gets hired to make this movie six years later hired to make this movie six years later with relatively little interest in with relatively little interest in baseball as far as I can tell, but baseball as far as I can tell, but understands the character aspect of this understands the character aspect of this beautifully. Makes this great film. He beautifully. Makes this great film. He makes uh Fox Catcher four years later, a makes uh Fox Catcher four years later, a movie that no longer exists. And which I movie that no longer exists. And which I kind of liked honestly, but it's a kind of liked honestly, but it's a little self-s serious. And then he has little self-s serious. And then he has not done anything since. And I wonder if not done anything since. And I wonder if like the legacy of this movie is dimmed like the legacy of this movie is dimmed at all because Benny Miller hasn't made at all because Benny Miller hasn't made a movie in over 10 years. Well, on our a movie in over 10 years. Well, on our list, it's one of the rare movies that list, it's one of the rare movies that is not like, oh, this is the this is not like, oh, this is the this director's slot.
