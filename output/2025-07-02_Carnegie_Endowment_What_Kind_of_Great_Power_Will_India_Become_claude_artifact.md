**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Evolution of U.S. Support for India's Rise

***"President Bush saw a good relationship with India as critical to preserving a wider balance of power that was favorable to U.S. interests."***

The United States has pursued a deliberate strategy since 2000 to help India become a major world power, beginning with President George W. Bush's transformative approach to overcome Cold War-era alienation. The civil nuclear deal served as the centerpiece of this strategy, designed to demonstrate American reliability as a partner. **Two primary motivations drove this policy**: first, the conviction that aiding India's rise served U.S. interests in protecting the liberal international order, and second, the belief that both countries could work together as partners in maintaining favorable global power dynamics.

Initially, this strategy operated in a context where U.S.-China relations remained relatively positive, creating what policymakers envisioned as a **"virtuous cycle of cooperation"** where the United States could maintain good relationships with both Asian powers. However, the deterioration of U.S.-China relations has fundamentally altered these calculations. The hard choices India avoided in the past have now become unavoidable, with U.S. policymakers increasingly asking **two critical questions**: what tangible benefits does America receive from supporting India's rise, and more fundamentally, whether India's rise itself remains in U.S. interests given the shadow of China's experience as a competitor created through decades of American support.

## 2. India's Economic Performance Gap with China

***"Around 1979 or 1980, the Indian and Chinese economies were roughly similar in size. Today, the Chinese economy is close to five times the size of the Indian economy."***

The stark divergence in economic trajectories between India and China since their respective reform periods reveals fundamental differences in growth performance. **China has maintained an average growth rate of approximately 9% annually since 1979**, while India, despite beginning reforms a decade later, has averaged only 6.5% growth. This seemingly modest differential has produced dramatic cumulative effects over four decades, resulting in China's economy becoming nearly five times larger than India's.

**Based on current trends, the Indian economy is unlikely to match its Chinese counterpart before the middle of the century, if at all.** For India to catch up by 2050, it would need to achieve a dramatic acceleration to near double-digit growth rates while China simultaneously experiences a severe slowdown to below 2% growth - a combination of circumstances that appears highly improbable. India's 6.5% average growth rate, while impressive by global standards, proves insufficient when competing with China's meteoric economic expansion. This growth differential has profound implications for relative power capabilities and India's ability to achieve its great power ambitions independently.

## 3. The Multipolarity Paradox

***"Among all the great powers, India is the weakest, and multipolar systems are notorious for failures of balancing because of buck passing - everyone expects the others to do the balancing."***

India's commitment to multipolarity creates a fundamental tension in its foreign policy strategy. While multipolarity theoretically offers India its own "place in the sun" as an independent pole of power, **it paradoxically threatens to leave India in the most vulnerable position** among potential great powers. The phenomenon of "buck passing" - where powers avoid the costs of balancing by expecting others to bear that burden - poses particular dangers for the weakest member of any multipolar arrangement.

**Three distinct international orders present different implications for India**: Under American unipolarity with deep bilateral ties, India could benefit from U.S. support without hesitation. In a U.S.-China bipolar system, India faces the uncomfortable reality of deep difficulties with one pole (China) while its relationship with the other (United States) depends on how valuable Washington perceives India in its competition with Beijing. The Cold War precedent, where India maintained good relations with both superpowers, cannot be replicated in a future U.S.-China bipolarity due to India's adversarial relationship with China.

India's pursuit of **"eclectic partnerships"** with groups like BRICS, while often performative rather than substantive, creates objective constraints on U.S.-India cooperation. These relationships, though primarily intended as leverage against the West, end up setting thresholds beyond which India will not go in supporting U.S. interests, creating frustration among American policymakers and limiting the depth of strategic cooperation.

## 4. Defense and Economic Integration Limitations

***"The kind of intimacy in defense cooperation that we would like to see is still elusive."***

Despite significant expansion in U.S.-India defense cooperation over the past two decades, **substantial gaps remain in three critical dimensions**. First, economic integration between the two countries has failed to develop the synergistic complementarity originally envisioned, with trade performance remaining disappointing and deep economic ties proving elusive. Second, India's maintenance of relationships with countries like Russia, while understandable from New Delhi's perspective, has created hesitation in Washington about the extent of high-technology cooperation possible with India. Third, defense cooperation, though more expansive than ever before, lacks the intimacy characteristic of America's relationships with its closest allies and partners.

**India's approach to international economic integration remains fundamentally constrained** by its focus on export promotion rather than genuine two-way integration. Recent trade agreements with the United Kingdom and ongoing negotiations with the European Union and United States represent tentative rather than transformative shifts. India seeks access to foreign capital and markets while maintaining reluctance about allowing foreign partners reciprocal access to Indian markets. This limited embrace of integration constrains India's growth potential by restricting access to global markets and supply chains essential for accelerated development.

## 5. The Democracy and Illiberalism Factor

***"China spends more on internal security than it does on external defense, despite having a population that is 91% Han and the benefits of synchrony."***

Democratic backsliding and rising illiberalism pose significant challenges to India's great power trajectory, though not in the straightforward manner often assumed. **The Chinese example demonstrates that authoritarianism doesn't prevent great power status but imposes substantial costs** - China's internal security spending exceeds its external defense budget of approximately $700 billion, despite enjoying ethnic homogeneity and geographic advantages India lacks.

**India's position proves far more complex** given its greater social, economic, and cultural diversity combined with weaker state capacity. To the extent that illiberal politics complicates India's ability to maintain internal peace, its pathway to great power status becomes harder. The deviation from India's constitutional inheritance of liberal democracy carries dual costs: increased internal frictions that complicate power production, and the loss of India's exemplary status as a successful developing democracy.

**Rising illiberalism in both India and the United States represents a "double tragedy"** that weakens both countries' material foundations of power. For the United States, illiberalism affects critical areas like immigration policy, rule of law, and international cooperation - all essential for maintaining American primacy. The U.S. population pyramid 25-30 years hence will require robust immigration to avoid unfavorable dependency ratios that characterize declining powers. India has been a massive beneficiary of America's liberal immigration policies, particularly those prioritizing high-skilled workers, making any reversal doubly damaging to bilateral ties.

## 6. Strategic Implications for U.S.-India Relations

***"At the end of the day, the U.S. is still the best bet with respect to enhancing Indian security in the geopolitical environment over the next two decades."***

The transformation from **"strategic altruism"** - where the United States supported India's rise without demanding immediate reciprocal benefits - to a more transactional approach under the Trump administration creates new challenges for bilateral relations. The current U.S. administration's view of China as primarily a trade problem rather than a strategic challenge introduces uncertainty about American commitment to balancing Beijing, raising Indian concerns about potential U.S.-China accommodation that could leave India isolated.

However, **looking beyond the current three-year horizon to 2047-2050**, structural factors suggest enduring convergence of U.S. and Indian interests. The China challenge will persist regardless of who occupies the White House, creating objective competitive interests between Washington and Beijing. India will lack the capacity to manage China's continued ascendancy independently, making partnership with the United States essential despite current frustrations.

**India's optimal strategy involves "running out the clock"** during the current period - providing minimal wins that satisfy both sides while building bridges to a potentially different future. This requires not giving up on the United States despite current difficulties, recognizing that relations with Washington, while hard to manage, must be managed nonetheless. The alternative - investing primarily in relationships with countries like Russia or other states - offers no comparable security benefits against the primary challenge of China's rise in the Indo-Pacific region over the coming decades.
