project the unmaking of a democracy published by the unmaking of a democracy published by wesland books two months ago Rahul to wesland books two months ago Rahul to begin with what led you as in you do begin with what led you as in you do write about this in your book but then write about this in your book but then what was the Tipping Point what was the Tipping Point where more than the book you felt that where more than the book you felt that you wanted to study talk to people you wanted to study talk to people and how did you reach here when I walk and how did you reach here when I walk into a story any story I have no idea into a story any story I have no idea what's going on um and it's very what's going on um and it's very unstructured because I'm looking for the unstructured because I'm looking for the story and trying to stay away from paths story and trying to stay away from paths that have been taken already um and so that have been taken already um and so that's what happened with this book that's what happened with this book actually it began as a book about adhar actually it began as a book about adhar itself this is because I I was aware of itself this is because I I was aware of critics of Adar were being surveilled critics of Adar were being surveilled they were being harassed and uh there they were being harassed and uh there were other things going on and I tried were other things going on and I tried to understand why was this happening the to understand why was this happening the way I approached it was to do interviews way I approached it was to do interviews with people and um you know there are with people and um you know there are there are people who read the news they there are people who read the news they catch up uh my my Approach is to just catch up uh my my Approach is to just pick up the phone call up people and say pick up the phone call up people and say can we meet and so I met people in Delhi can we meet and so I met people in Delhi Bangalore Bombay jarand a bunch of Bangalore Bombay jarand a bunch of places went and witnessed things saw places went and witnessed things saw things for myself um went to the Supreme things for myself um went to the Supreme Court and was there for the the day the Court and was there for the the day the Judgment was delivered for you know the Judgment was delivered for you know the adhar judgment and that's how I was adhar judgment and that's how I was going about it but while it was dramatic going about it but while it was dramatic and very very important at some level it and very very important at some level it it felt to me like there was something it felt to me like there was something else going on over there there were else going on over there there were other concerns that were that were other concerns that were that were creeping into arguments against adhar creeping into arguments against adhar one of which was surveillance the other one of which was surveillance the other one was oppression the third was rights one was oppression the third was rights and these larger themes were there at and these larger themes were there at the back of my mind and um while I spoke the back of my mind and um while I spoke to people they they were deep thinkers to people they they were deep thinkers about such things they they asked about such things they they asked questions about whether corruption was questions about whether corruption was the largest issue that India was the largest issue that India was confronted with and so these issues confronted with and so these issues stayed with me me and I wanted to stayed with me me and I wanted to explore them further and I didn't really explore them further and I didn't really know if adhar was the way to do it it know if adhar was the way to do it it just didn't feel right as as a writer just didn't feel right as as a writer and while I was doing these interviews and while I was doing these interviews uh the CAA protests uh the CAA protests began and then I just said let me just began and then I just said let me just go figure out what's going on over there go figure out what's going on over there I went interviewed people in Northeast I went interviewed people in Northeast Delhi uh found someone who becomes the Delhi uh found someone who becomes the the Beating Heart of the book and and um the Beating Heart of the book and and um at a certain point a conversation with at a certain point a conversation with people who had worked on an earlier people who had worked on an earlier iteration of Adar a certain kind of iteration of Adar a certain kind of identification project they told me that identification project they told me that uh the idea had come from LK advani and uh the idea had come from LK advani and and so it seemed like I was coming at a and so it seemed like I was coming at a story from one stream but then there was story from one stream but then there was something else going on over here which something else going on over here which was which was connected to this to this was which was connected to this to this particular stream but it headed off in a particular stream but it headed off in a different Direction and so I felt like different Direction and so I felt like to study to understand adhar and the to study to understand adhar and the impulses behind it um I really had to impulses behind it um I really had to understand the right wing and the rise understand the right wing and the rise of the right and so I went along that of the right and so I went along that way with uh with interviews as well as way with uh with interviews as well as archival work so your book it's sort of archival work so your book it's sort of spread out across five chapters as you spread out across five chapters as you said um you begin with the Delhi poam said um you begin with the Delhi poam covering many people with whom you still covering many people with whom you still still in touch with and then you go back still in touch with and then you go back to history then coming back to sort of to history then coming back to sort of late '90s history with LK adwani and late '90s history with LK adwani and then sort of again looking at what is then sort of again looking at what is happening now with various people coming happening now with various people coming the next question I want to ask is now the next question I want to ask is now that you have gone through these um that you have gone through these um texts so to speak now that you standing texts so to speak now that you standing here how different is India's here how different is India's identification project from the rest of identification project from the rest of totalitarian systems across the world totalitarian systems across the world given that Adar is perhaps the only given that Adar is perhaps the only identification project that FES identification project that FES biometric data it's interesting I was so biometric data it's interesting I was so overwhelmed by what I was Finding over overwhelmed by what I was Finding over here and there was so much to see here here and there was so much to see here that I read about what was happening in that I read about what was happening in other parts of the world briefly just other parts of the world briefly just enough to know that there were enough to know that there were guardrails around other identification guardrails around other identification systems so when people say well you know systems so when people say well you know the West already has your data or that the West already has your data or that social security number is Adar no social security number is Adar no they're not they're not because we don't they're not they're not because we don't have those protections that people in have those protections that people in other countries do if somebody misuses other countries do if somebody misuses my data and say uses it to essentially my data and say uses it to essentially burn down my house what am I going to do burn down my house what am I going to do what are my protections so we're looking what are my protections so we're looking at two entirely different cultures at two entirely different cultures now is adhar useful yes it is in certain now is adhar useful yes it is in certain ways it is very very useful but that's ways it is very very useful but that's not been the point the point has always not been the point the point has always been what protections exist around it been what protections exist around it Are People Protected can they keep their Are People Protected can they keep their rights can they exercise their rights is rights can they exercise their rights is this that kind of country uh can you this that kind of country uh can you oppose certain things so I I felt I felt oppose certain things so I I felt I felt like this discussion about Adar from the like this discussion about Adar from the very beginning while it had public very beginning while it had public consultations and things like that it consultations and things like that it wasn't truly inclusive and it wasn't wasn't truly inclusive and it wasn't truly inclusive because of this idea truly inclusive because of this idea that you listen to too many voices and that you listen to too many voices and the project will get stuck or you know the project will get stuck or you know to make a thing happen fast you just to make a thing happen fast you just implement it you you push it out there implement it you you push it out there and then you make fixes as you go along and then you make fixes as you go along so you you get the results that you get so you you get the results that you get you know that you got um which is that you know that you got um which is that people died of hunger which is that people died of hunger which is that people even today uh you've got millions people even today uh you've got millions of people I guess who can't use their of people I guess who can't use their adhar for whatever reason and there are adhar for whatever reason and there are these attendant difficulties that come these attendant difficulties that come with it so I think when I when I look at with it so I think when I when I look at adhar I'm not just looking at the adhar I'm not just looking at the technological aspect of it I'm looking technological aspect of it I'm looking at the world in which it exists and that at the world in which it exists and that world tells me that something like Adar world tells me that something like Adar can be uh and this is more than can be uh and this is more than theoretical by now it can have its fair theoretical by now it can have its fair share of harm and it can it can have share of harm and it can it can have disproportionate harm coming to the disproportionate harm coming to the whole disproportionate harm I think whole disproportionate harm I think that's where you are taking taking me to that's where you are taking taking me to the next question um and that question the next question um and that question is in two parts the first is the idea of is in two parts the first is the idea of ownership custodianship and security ownership custodianship and security that adhar provides so to speak how do that adhar provides so to speak how do you see who owns data who doesn't own you see who owns data who doesn't own data who is the custodian given that um data who is the custodian given that um at least in Rak kera's book uh the Big at least in Rak kera's book uh the Big Brother they do document that uh our Brother they do document that uh our data is sold to other countri not just data is sold to other countri not just breaches within India but then also uh breaches within India but then also uh in countries like France so where do you in countries like France so where do you see that kind of ambiguity or perhaps see that kind of ambiguity or perhaps Beyond ambiguity also this kind of Beyond ambiguity also this kind of centralization of power and the second centralization of power and the second question is related to technological question is related to technological advancements like AI um because I IID advancements like AI um because I IID used a report uh published in the AL used a report uh published in the AL jaaz where AI generat technology jaaz where AI generat technology basically is in use and the people who basically is in use and the people who are affected are the most marginalized are affected are the most marginalized because they are the ones who do not get because they are the ones who do not get food or do not get a job so how do you food or do not get a job so how do you see these two aspects of adhar and um see these two aspects of adhar and um identity look I think people have identity look I think people have studied centralization and they've and studied centralization and they've and they've written about it I'll tell you they've written about it I'll tell you what I'm thinking about when I think what I'm thinking about when I think about data and Adar and other things I about data and Adar and other things I don't focus on the high-tech stuff as don't focus on the high-tech stuff as much as I do on much as I do on how things have been used in the past how things have been used in the past that data has leaked we know water roles that data has leaked we know water roles all kinds of other identification all of all kinds of other identification all of this stuff is is floating around in The this stuff is is floating around in The Ether the thing that I felt was at every Ether the thing that I felt was at every given point when there was news about given point when there was news about leaks and you would imagine that leaks and you would imagine that somebody would take that on somebody would take that on board um instead what happened board um instead what happened was people organized ations one was people organized ations one organization started getting organization started getting notices uh threatening notices and I'm notices uh threatening notices and I'm I'm referring in this instance to uh the I'm referring in this instance to uh the center for internet and Society in center for internet and Society in Bangalore whose funders I believe then Bangalore whose funders I believe then sort of pulled back um and so so the sort of pulled back um and so so the question I kept asking myself was look question I kept asking myself was look centralization is one thing how are we centralization is one thing how are we not even able to have that conversation not even able to have that conversation in the first place and why is that the in the first place and why is that the the idea of that information being out the idea of that information being out there of public scrutiny uh a why is it there of public scrutiny uh a why is it not happening and B why is there why not happening and B why is there why isn't there that kind of outrage that isn't there that kind of outrage that you would imagine people would people you would imagine people would people would have and I think it's it's for a would have and I think it's it's for a number of reasons and I think it comes number of reasons and I think it comes back to the the question that you're back to the the question that you're asking about the centralization of data asking about the centralization of data which is people don't really think which is people don't really think about what's going on with their data about what's going on with their data and I I I think and I I I think I think if they stopped and thought I think if they stopped and thought about what it actually meant to have about what it actually meant to have their data floating around out there and their data floating around out there and what it reveals about them I know at at what it reveals about them I know at at some theoretical level they kind of get some theoretical level they kind of get it but what does it mean when you can be it but what does it mean when you can be identified your your ailments can be identified your your ailments can be identified they can be connected to you identified they can be connected to you your car your movements can be connected your car your movements can be connected to you and you're seeing this across the to you and you're seeing this across the board you're starting to see a certain board you're starting to see a certain kind of super profile emerge I mean Adar kind of super profile emerge I mean Adar itself States built these things called itself States built these things called State resident data hubs um which State resident data hubs um which provided a 360° view of of people a provided a 360° view of of people a single source of truth I believe it was single source of truth I believe it was called so so I think when you look at called so so I think when you look at these these developments you wonder these these developments you wonder where exactly your data is floating where exactly your data is floating around how it's going to be used and why around how it's going to be used and why exactly these these particular databases exactly these these particular databases are coming up we haven't been able to are coming up we haven't been able to have that conversation yet I think have that conversation yet I think that's for a number of reasons that's that's for a number of reasons that's the first part look I don't know about the first part look I don't know about AI uh I haven't studied it enough uh AI uh I haven't studied it enough uh I've been reading the hype like I've been reading the hype like everybody else uh and what exactly AI is everybody else uh and what exactly AI is at the moment I still don't I still at the moment I still don't quite get I mean I'm not don't quite get I mean I'm not completely confident about it but you completely confident about it but you see it over time when new technology see it over time when new technology emerges it is used it's those those old emerges it is used it's those those old intentions don't really go away those intentions don't really go away those old ideas and impulses that exist in old ideas and impulses that exist in Indian Society they don't go away they Indian Society they don't go away they just sort of piggy back on whatever just sort of piggy back on whatever technology exists I wouldn't be technology exists I wouldn't be surprised if AI works that way as well surprised if AI works that way as well Rahul with the there are notifications Rahul with the there are notifications right that the government releases with right that the government releases with many laws Sometimes they come say they many laws Sometimes they come say they come up with saying that no this law is come up with saying that no this law is not going to be bad for you this is for not going to be bad for you this is for the good Etc so if you look at the Sami the good Etc so if you look at the Sami judgment the right to privacy we have a judgment the right to privacy we have a judgment you've covered that uh if you judgment you've covered that uh if you could just speak your experience of could just speak your experience of being inside the court and observing and being inside the court and observing and then sort of trying to see or observe if then sort of trying to see or observe if the judgment is basically does it work the judgment is basically does it work on ground does not does it what does it on ground does not does it what does it do does it make any sense at all uh with do does it make any sense at all uh with these judgments I mean at at some level these judgments I mean at at some level when you hear these judgments and uh when you hear these judgments and uh I'll get to my experience in the I'll get to my experience in the courtroom in a second but when you hear courtroom in a second but when you hear these judgments they really soaring and these judgments they really soaring and they fill you with belief and a certain they fill you with belief and a certain optimism that there are sort of right optimism that there are sort of right thinking people who who understand the thinking people who who understand the weight of uh the gravity of this moment weight of uh the gravity of this moment and about what's happening in the and about what's happening in the country around them and they're making country around them and they're making what you'd consider uh decisions in the what you'd consider uh decisions in the public interest when the Adar judgment public interest when the Adar judgment was delivered I had to be there because was delivered I had to be there because I I I wanted to write about it that I I I wanted to write about it that moment was was already a scene in my moment was was already a scene in my head and so I you know I asked around head and so I you know I asked around and you know was able to get and you know was able to get in and be a part of that large Crush of in and be a part of that large Crush of lawyers that fills courtroom court lawyers that fills courtroom court number one um and and saw the little the number one um and and saw the little the little Customs that they have the five little Customs that they have the five turbaned men who come out who pull the turbaned men who come out who pull the chairs uh and then who push them back as chairs uh and then who push them back as as the justices sit on them uh I saw as the justices sit on them uh I saw that this judgment itself was that this judgment itself was about 5 or 6 in thick when it was picked about 5 or 6 in thick when it was picked up by I think the clerks and and put up up by I think the clerks and and put up over there in front of them uh and for a over there in front of them uh and for a moment they admired it they looked at moment they admired it they looked at all the posted notes and everything and all the posted notes and everything and and I was there to write about that but and I was there to write about that but I was also there to watch and record the I was also there to watch and record the looks on the faces of the various people looks on the faces of the various people who were involved in this case who were involved in this case especially the especially the especially the petitioners and I was taking my cues petitioners and I was taking my cues from them as well from their faces I was from them as well from their faces I was I was listening to it and sort of also I was listening to it and sort of also had my own interpretation as this was had my own interpretation as this was going on but the lawyers had their own going on but the lawyers had their own interpretation as well which which they interpretation as well which which they could see further than I could but I saw could see further than I could but I saw a lot of optimism and I saw like grounds a lot of optimism and I saw like grounds for the future especially in especially for the future especially in especially in U Justice chandra's descent then in U Justice chandra's descent then after it was all done um we all walked after it was all done um we all walked out and I was just hanging around with out and I was just hanging around with people at that point and I got a more people at that point and I got a more nuanced reading of it which is that some nuanced reading of it which is that some parts of it were great some parts of it parts of it were great some parts of it were not so good some parts well it was were not so good some parts well it was a mixed bag for everything but then you a mixed bag for everything but then you come out and you're you're outside the come out and you're you're outside the Supreme Court of India you're out on the Supreme Court of India you're out on the main road you walking around in East main road you walking around in East Delhi and the law exists but Delhi and the law exists but not quite in the form that you'd imagine not quite in the form that you'd imagine um you realize that at one level what um you realize that at one level what you see in courot is very theoretical you see in courot is very theoretical it's like it's like a textbook of sorts it's like it's like a textbook of sorts if I can make it terrible terrible if I can make it terrible terrible analogy it's like a textbook of sorts analogy it's like a textbook of sorts but out there on the street when you see but out there on the street when you see people acting in certain ways and the people acting in certain ways and the police acting in other ways you you see police acting in other ways you you see that somehow there that these judgments that somehow there that these judgments don't seem to don't seem to reach people on the ground your your reach people on the ground your your your everyday the people you contact your everyday the people you contact you're in touch with every day you're in touch with every day technically even after these after the technically even after these after the Judgment came out we were still Judgment came out we were still receiving calls from from various Banks receiving calls from from various Banks and phone companies and other odd places and phone companies and other odd places saying give us your adhar and and so you saying give us your adhar and and so you tend to see that okay there are tend to see that okay there are limitations to this and that limitation limitations to this and that limitation happens to be almost I I wondered if it happens to be almost I I wondered if it had something to do with jobs and had something to do with jobs and unemployment and the lack of choice that unemployment and the lack of choice that people have where when you're within an people have where when you're within an organization uh you get an order from organization uh you get an order from above you just do what you have to to to above you just do what you have to to to essentially keep your job so so essentially keep your job so so essentially the bureaucracy passes an essentially the bureaucracy passes an order down and when I say bureaucracy I order down and when I say bureaucracy I don't mean the government bureaucracy don't mean the government bureaucracy but I'm talking about corporate but I'm talking about corporate bureaucracies and that hierarchy that bureaucracies and that hierarchy that exists where somebody on top says you exists where somebody on top says you know get people's Adar number know get people's Adar number and it comes down as an order and the and it comes down as an order and the person who passes that order by the time person who passes that order by the time it comes to this the clerk by the time it comes to this the clerk at the bottom who you're sort of dealing at the bottom who you're sort of dealing with that person is faceless is with that person is faceless is invisible but this person who you're invisible but this person who you're interacting with becomes almost like an interacting with becomes almost like an oppressive figure and so you when you oppressive figure and so you when you see these things uh the number of times see these things uh the number of times I had to sort of wave a sheath of papers I had to sort of wave a sheath of papers saying look the Supreme Court of India saying look the Supreme Court of India said you cannot do this and they would said you cannot do this and they would have this blank look on their face and have this blank look on their face and they would say but sir it has come from they would say but sir it has come from above you know for them there is only above you know for them there is only one one sort of you know the Supreme one one sort of you know the Supreme Court and that Supreme Court is not the Court and that Supreme Court is not the Supreme Court it's essentially up the Supreme Court it's essentially up the chain that they report to chain that they report to so so I think it has its limits um it so so I think it has its limits um it clearly shows you that we have larger clearly shows you that we have larger problems that larger problem is also problems that larger problem is also again one of the things that you talk again one of the things that you talk about in your book especially the part about in your book especially the part when you lay down LK adani's time and when you lay down LK adani's time and how adhar was coming up right so if you how adhar was coming up right so if you could just talk about that entire part could just talk about that entire part of adwani and why adhar was brought I'll of adwani and why adhar was brought I'll go back a little bit um you know for go back a little bit um you know for people who haven't read the book there people who haven't read the book there are five sections to the book the first are five sections to the book the first of them opens on the citizenship of them opens on the citizenship Amendment act protests in Delhi in Amendment act protests in Delhi in December December December 2019 and uh I follow people around as 2019 and uh I follow people around as they protest as they witness the they protest as they witness the violence in Delhi and uh along the way violence in Delhi and uh along the way it becomes a profile of what it means to it becomes a profile of what it means to be like almost like a composite picture be like almost like a composite picture of what it means to be a Muslim uh in of what it means to be a Muslim uh in India uh at this point in time where you India uh at this point in time where you have all this misinformation coming at have all this misinformation coming at you you've got all this oppression the you you've got all this oppression the police not working in the way you hope police not working in the way you hope it will and one of them wonders where is it will and one of them wonders where is the poison coming from and I use that to the poison coming from and I use that to launch into the second section which is launch into the second section which is a historical section and in that uh what a historical section and in that uh what I'm doing is going back in history uh I'm doing is going back in history uh way back to the way back to the 1870s and um you know looking at the 1870s and um you know looking at the Arya samage and how they had cow Arya samage and how they had cow protection sort of units at that point protection sort of units at that point how young men were coming together and how young men were coming together and organizing and and they had these clubs organizing and and they had these clubs where eventually they would end up uh where eventually they would end up uh you know practicing with the LTI and you know practicing with the LTI and doing the sort of exercises that you see doing the sort of exercises that you see a lot of today and how it a lot of today and how it you how that action moves to the you how that action moves to the mahasabha and then um uh the the rria mahasabha and then um uh the the rria swak S the RSS um and I show how at a swak S the RSS um and I show how at a certain point even even Neu himself certain point even even Neu himself didn't quite know what to do uh he he didn't quite know what to do uh he he was surrounded by what he called a was surrounded by what he called a certain communal state of mind and U certain communal state of mind and U that communal state of mind he felt was that communal state of mind he felt was freeing the fabric of this country that freeing the fabric of this country that he that he hoped uh to build at some he that he hoped uh to build at some point and so as as we go along in the point and so as as we go along in the book as as you read the book um you'll book as as you read the book um you'll see a few themes emerging one is see a few themes emerging one is militancy you'll see uh militancy you'll see uh misinformation um and you see precursors misinformation um and you see precursors to a lot of these WhatsApp messages that to a lot of these WhatsApp messages that you get um and you start to see the rise you get um and you start to see the rise of these things and more importantly how of these things and more importantly how they how they sort of get into people's they how they sort of get into people's heads and they Harden people minds and heads and they Harden people minds and hearts with that I take you to section hearts with that I take you to section three which is where I speak to people three which is where I speak to people who were a part of the RSS and who are a who were a part of the RSS and who are a part of the RSS um and try and see the part of the RSS um and try and see the world through their eyes um try and world through their eyes um try and understand if they left why they left if understand if they left why they left if they're staying why they're staying what they're staying why they're staying what the dangers are if they you know if the dangers are if they you know if you're staying what what you see as the you're staying what what you see as the dangers in your country if you've left dangers in your country if you've left what you see as the dangers of the RSS what you see as the dangers of the RSS so these are things that um I I I went so these are things that um I I I went into now I worked at it backwards into now I worked at it backwards because at a certain point when I was because at a certain point when I was working on adhar and adwani came up the working on adhar and adwani came up the question then was I want to know where question then was I want to know where adwani came from um and that led me to adwani came from um and that led me to the RSS and so when that happened from a the RSS and so when that happened from a research perspective I go back to the research perspective I go back to the ARA samage and come back over here but ARA samage and come back over here but now there's adwani who's a central now there's adwani who's a central figure in this adwani is plays a a figure in this adwani is plays a a pivotal role in in section 4 which is pivotal role in in section 4 which is that look this is a personal book as that look this is a personal book as well at some level it's it's it's well at some level it's it's it's investigative and uh I go into the investigative and uh I go into the archives I do the leg work but at the archives I do the leg work but at the same time I also really wanted to put my same time I also really wanted to put my own feelings and thoughts and certain own feelings and thoughts and certain kind of family history on the page uh kind of family history on the page uh because we we've lived through this time because we we've lived through this time and we've and we've and we've experienced the last 30 40 years um you experienced the last 30 40 years um you know my generation has experienced the know my generation has experienced the last 40 years my parents have have done last 40 years my parents have have done the last 50 60 70 years their parents the last 50 60 70 years their parents saw saw saw 1947 and and so I felt like there was a 1947 and and so I felt like there was a certain kind of family thread that was certain kind of family thread that was running running running through uh through this book as well and through uh through this book as well and from time to time it comes up I show you from time to time it comes up I show you that for me adwani was this figure who that for me adwani was this figure who was inextricable from what happened in was inextricable from what happened in 1992 especially December 6th 1992 the 1992 especially December 6th 1992 the rat yatra and for me that he he was a he rat yatra and for me that he he was a particular kind of figure because was a particular kind of figure because this this yatra that he led this this this this yatra that he led this this journey that he led and the violence journey that he led and the violence that surrounded it and in the aftermath that surrounded it and in the aftermath of the demolition the the way the way of the demolition the the way the way things spiraled for people in in Bombay things spiraled for people in in Bombay in particular I was a child um and my in particular I was a child um and my mother was in touch with her sister who mother was in touch with her sister who was in Bombay and we were outside the was in Bombay and we were outside the country at that point and um and I would country at that point and um and I would catch snatches of these conversations catch snatches of these conversations and for me those images are very Vivid and for me those images are very Vivid in my mind they're very very Vivid and in my mind they're very very Vivid and that's where adwani was but I wanted to that's where adwani was but I wanted to meet him I wanted to see him I wanted to meet him I wanted to see him I wanted to ask him questions but I also wanted to ask him questions but I also wanted to know where he was from so I looked at know where he was from so I looked at the RSS literature I looked at some the RSS literature I looked at some books that had been written I found this books that had been written I found this incredible um I I think it calls itself incredible um I I think it calls itself an unauthorized biography an unauthorized biography of adwani although it felt it felt like of adwani although it felt it felt like I wondered if the details in this book I wondered if the details in this book came from adwani himself it's called Uh came from adwani himself it's called Uh the Advent of adwani and it's really the Advent of adwani and it's really worth reading U for many reasons because worth reading U for many reasons because it gives you a real sense of and you it gives you a real sense of and you have to take these things with a pinch have to take these things with a pinch of salt uh um because it's not really of salt uh um because it's not really footnoted or anything but it gives you a footnoted or anything but it gives you a real sense of what was going on with the real sense of what was going on with the uh the s in the 19 1930s and 40s in uh the s in the 19 1930s and 40s in Karachi um where where I believe adwani Karachi um where where I believe adwani was and it it tells you about his was and it it tells you about his childhood and it tells you about how he childhood and it tells you about how he he took to poetry and all all of those he took to poetry and all all of those other things and it made him it made him other things and it made him seem like a very sort of soft gentle and seem like a very sort of soft gentle and extremely likable person but then in extremely likable person but then in history and in in in in the s's Legend history and in in in in the s's Legend this is who he is but then in my mind this is who he is but then in my mind there's something else entirely so so I there's something else entirely so so I I write about him that way and um I go I write about him that way and um I go and meet a person I'm unable to meet him and meet a person I'm unable to meet him I go and meet his pa uh uh a person I go and meet his pa uh uh a person named pankaj Chopra and uh he tells me named pankaj Chopra and uh he tells me about those days as when they were on about those days as when they were on the on the yatra the kind of passion the on the yatra the kind of passion they saw and all of those things and and they saw and all of those things and and he was he was he remembered it very he was he was he remembered it very fondly but when I asked him about the fondly but when I asked him about the violence I write about it in the book violence I write about it in the book there was a certain look on his face there was a certain look on his face that I that I won't forget that I that I won't forget I came away slightly Disturbed like I I came away slightly Disturbed like I don't know why but I expect remorse uh I don't know why but I expect remorse uh I expect a certain kind of regret I didn't expect a certain kind of regret I didn't see that he's a nice man I mean he he see that he's a nice man I mean he he I'm talking about Mr adani's PA he's I'm talking about Mr adani's PA he's head of this organization called tacmic head of this organization called tacmic India um and there were these incredible India um and there were these incredible letters either thanking him for his help letters either thanking him for his help or asking for his help for blood and or asking for his help for blood and other things like that and I was other things like that and I was weighing all these things in my mind weighing all these things in my mind mind like at some level there is a a mind like at some level there is a a humanitarian element or rather a humanitarian element or rather a humanist element to them but then there humanist element to them but then there is this also this very charged political is this also this very charged political side which is very cynical deeply side which is very cynical deeply cynical and extremely damaging so I I I cynical and extremely damaging so I I I sort of piece together a profile but sort of piece together a profile but where adwani really comes into the where adwani really comes into the picture is when with all his with his picture is when with all his with his upbringing and the experience of Gill upbringing and the experience of Gill and the hijacking especially and the hijacking especially um he decides that he needs an um he decides that he needs an identification project that will find identification project that will find infiltrators and uh for me when I heard infiltrators and uh for me when I heard of that the first time honestly it was a of that the first time honestly it was a jaw-dropping moment because it opened up jaw-dropping moment because it opened up this whole other angle I had been this whole other angle I had been looking at it from a technological angle looking at it from a technological angle but when one of the earliest ideas years but when one of the earliest ideas years of it now it doesn't matter how a of it now it doesn't matter how a technology is used well it does matter technology is used well it does matter but what I'm saying is that technology but what I'm saying is that technology over a period of time the use of it can over a period of time the use of it can change but that initial kernel the idea change but that initial kernel the idea that goes into the creation of it or that goes into the creation of it or something like it um I would say it something like it um I would say it doesn't really go away it can do that it doesn't really go away it can do that it can and so and so for me the idea that can and so and so for me the idea that adwani g was going off to Assam and he adwani g was going off to Assam and he was talking about infiltrators over was talking about infiltrators over there and you go to Assam and you talk there and you go to Assam and you talk about infiltrators I mean like I asked about infiltrators I mean like I asked everybody like what do you think of this everybody like what do you think of this each and every person told me yeah he each and every person told me yeah he means Muslims so you know I was hesitant means Muslims so you know I was hesitant to sort of say it myself but I think you to sort of say it myself but I think you as a reporter at least I as a reporter as a reporter at least I as a reporter sometimes um make sure that I'm talking sometimes um make sure that I'm talking to enough people and asking them what to enough people and asking them what this particular word can mean until this particular word can mean until there is no doubt in my mind that this there is no doubt in my mind that this is how it is perceived the word itself is how it is perceived the word itself infiltrator has a particular meaning but infiltrator has a particular meaning but when it is said in a particular area it when it is said in a particular area it means something else and I think and I means something else and I think for me that being the root of what think for me that being the root of what we see today was very interesting I we see today was very interesting I think for me Rahul that was also my think for me Rahul that was also my jaw-dropping moment while reading your jaw-dropping moment while reading your book because then by the third chapter I book because then by the third chapter I think I had a fair idea of okay this is think I had a fair idea of okay this is the narrative and then you bring this the narrative and then you bring this adwani and Carill and the reason why he adwani and Carill and the reason why he wanted an identity project and by then wanted an identity project and by then Adar wasn't there but then the seed was Adar wasn't there but then the seed was already swed right so for me that was my already swed right so for me that was my jaw-dropping moment and thus I think I jaw-dropping moment and thus I think I was able to connect the whole was able to connect the whole surveillance internet industry so to surveillance internet industry so to speak of America and India together to speak of America and India together to an extent thus my question next is more an extent thus my question next is more towards the reason why the uh internet towards the reason why the uh internet or Technologies are brought to any place or Technologies are brought to any place without consultation or with without consultation or with consultation however one wants to build consultation however one wants to build a narrative and consensus right with a narrative and consensus right with technology and especially what what technology and especially what what we've been seeing as you have also like we've been seeing as you have also like sort of shown through your book it has sort of shown through your book it has become easier for the state to profile become easier for the state to profile people any profile for that matter right people any profile for that matter right um and with the disintegration so to um and with the disintegration so to speak of Cambridge analytica and other speak of Cambridge analytica and other services uh corporate and government services uh corporate and government services it's sort of become even more services it's sort of become even more easier from the already easier space of easier from the already easier space of profiling people how do you think I mean profiling people how do you think I mean especially with the new criminal laws especially with the new criminal laws where a lot of power has been given to where a lot of power has been given to the police and investigating officers the police and investigating officers how do you see the law and Technology to how do you see the law and Technology to together being used because you also together being used because you also speak about this in your book which is speak about this in your book which is why I'm asking the question you you sort why I'm asking the question you you sort of speak about the social reality of of speak about the social reality of people where people are watched when it people where people are watched when it comes to intercast marriages or comes to intercast marriages or interreligious marriages it's become interreligious marriages it's become it's really difficult to sort of do it's really difficult to sort of do anything without the eyes of the state anything without the eyes of the state watching anybody right so that's the watching anybody right so that's the question um how do you see technology question um how do you see technology new laws and the kind of acceleration of new laws and the kind of acceleration of data infrastructures in this country data infrastructures in this country where do you think this is going I think where do you think this is going I think these are for me these are two uh these these are for me these are two uh these are two separate things uh I'll just are two separate things uh I'll just tell you why um we're so used to the tell you why um we're so used to the enforcement of new technology on us that enforcement of new technology on us that we don't really I think people don't we don't really I think people don't stop and think about what they've given stop and think about what they've given up uh sometimes it's actually just act up uh sometimes it's actually just act it's it's actively physical space uh it's it's actively physical space uh that they've that they've given up so that they've that they've given up so I'll give you you know I'll give you an I'll give you you know I'll give you an example fast tag for example which you example fast tag for example which you have on a lot of cars it waves you have on a lot of cars it waves you through uh and yet if you I don't know through uh and yet if you I don't know how it is in other places but say on the how it is in other places but say on the bandra verly cink over here in Bombay bandra verly cink over here in Bombay you have something like eight Lanes you have something like eight Lanes dedicated to it whereas you have two for dedicated to it whereas you have two for cash you pay more for cash you wait cash you pay more for cash you wait longer for cash and you are made to wait longer for cash and you are made to wait longer it's not like the people who longer it's not like the people who moved to digital have made things better moved to digital have made things better all around it's just simply that all around it's just simply that somebody has taken the decision because somebody has taken the decision because people have say volunteered or rather people have say volunteered or rather chosen to take up fast tag we're giving chosen to take up fast tag we're giving them eight Lanes we're leaving only two them eight Lanes we're leaving only two for people who use cash which is legal for people who use cash which is legal and so and so you you see which is legal and so and so you you see this kind of thing happen at airports this kind of thing happen at airports with Digi yatra um and with other with Digi yatra um and with other whatever new technology facial whatever new technology facial recognition or whatever else it is and recognition or whatever else it is and you find yourself locked out of that you find yourself locked out of that debate it's not even a debate it's just debate it's not even a debate it's just a public private partnership a a public private partnership a commercial consideration you are using a commercial consideration you are using a facility the road is not a road anymore facility the road is not a road anymore it's not a road that you can use freely it's not a road that you can use freely it's not a road that you can use in the it's not a road that you can use in the way that you want you have a certain way that you want you have a certain kind of choice taken away from you when kind of choice taken away from you when I was reporting the book I kept thinking I was reporting the book I kept thinking about what it means to have public about what it means to have public participation and I have friends who've participation and I have friends who've gone and covered um sort of gone and covered um sort of consultations and meets for you know um consultations and meets for you know um say somebody wants to buy land in jarand say somebody wants to buy land in jarand um and and they they're having a meeting um and and they they're having a meeting with I don't know tribals or or or with I don't know tribals or or or locals or whoever and and you hear of locals or whoever and and you hear of the travesty of in those places I I the travesty of in those places I I think I think somewhere think I think somewhere you don't really know or you're made to you don't really know or you're made to feel like all of this is going to happen feel like all of this is going to happen you just have to accept it because that you just have to accept it because that is progress but this is somebody's idea is progress but this is somebody's idea of progress and we're not questioning of progress and we're not questioning that enough like what are alternative that enough like what are alternative ways of thinking about these things I ways of thinking about these things I don't know uh but I'd love to hear from don't know uh but I'd love to hear from people you know I mean I I would love to people you know I mean I I would love to hear the range of possibilities that hear the range of possibilities that exists but you don't hear from them and exists but you don't hear from them and why don't you hear from them it's why don't you hear from them it's because fewer and fewer people are able because fewer and fewer people are able to sort of Express their ideas of India to sort of Express their ideas of India of what this country can be by that I of what this country can be by that I mean if you look at the mean if you look at the newspapers um you find a celebration of newspapers um you find a celebration of wealth and power in them each of us wealth and power in them each of us carries almost like in our heads we carries almost like in our heads we carry a Manifesto for India like what I carry a Manifesto for India like what I would do if I was prime would what I would do if I was prime minister like I I'd remove the number of minister like I I'd remove the number of times I've heard of these things but you times I've heard of these things but you carry along these ideas of how life can carry along these ideas of how life can be better you're not ask asked you're be better you're not ask asked you're not able to express these things where not able to express these things where do you go do you write a substack with do you go do you write a substack with like 30 readers and work up your way to like 30 readers and work up your way to some kind of Engagement so you have some kind of Engagement so you have newspapers putting powerful people on a newspapers putting powerful people on a pedestal they're allowed to express an pedestal they're allowed to express an idea of technology and the others who idea of technology and the others who sort of suffer through it are made sort of suffer through it are made almost voiceless it's it's almost as if almost voiceless it's it's almost as if they their cranks and freaks well Lites they their cranks and freaks well Lites who who don't see it for what it is who who don't see it for what it is which is a sort of an annexation of of which is a sort of an annexation of of of public spaces and of public functions of public spaces and of public functions so at one level you have that and then so at one level you have that and then you've got criminal laws and other such you've got criminal laws and other such laws which are passed through with very laws which are passed through with very little debate no little debate no deliberation in that no public deliberation in that no public consultation no deliberation worth the consultation no deliberation worth the name and you don't know why it's name and you don't know why it's happening um and I speak as a reporter I happening um and I speak as a reporter I don't I don't always know why these don't I don't always know why these things are happening and so you see at things are happening and so you see at every every level you're pushed out of every every level you're pushed out of the decision- making process you're not the decision- making process you're not involved it hit me the first time when involved it hit me the first time when way back in 2014 or 2015 Niti AOG had way back in 2014 or 2015 Niti AOG had this was it Niti AOG or somebody else this was it Niti AOG or somebody else they had the smart cities competition they had the smart cities competition and they said this will be consultative and they said this will be consultative it will it'll bring your thoughts it will it'll bring your thoughts together and all of that and it'll be together and all of that and it'll be participatory and and all the all that participatory and and all the all that stuff and how were you to participate stuff and how were you to participate one of the ways in which you would one of the ways in which you would participate was by by designing some participate was by by designing some kind of logo on some government website kind of logo on some government website and I looked at that and and I looked at that and thought that is participation thought that is participation but what really you know and so and so but what really you know and so and so you had a sense that this is where you had a sense that this is where things were going to go but now where things were going to go but now where these laws affect you where facial these laws affect you where facial recognition can affect you where recognition can affect you where databases can certainly certainly be databases can certainly certainly be used against you you really don't have a used against you you really don't have a say or you've given up and and and said say or you've given up and and and said many people have just given up and said many people have just given up and said well my data is already out there so well my data is already out there so might as well just add to one more might as well just add to one more database if you pull that particular database if you pull that particular thread um it raises fundamental thread um it raises fundamental questions questions questions about what citizens think they're doing about what citizens think they're doing and and what they think their role is is and and what they think their role is is their role to to vote every 5 years and their role to to vote every 5 years and then leave it at that is it to just earn then leave it at that is it to just earn as much money as you can so that you as much money as you can so that you achieve escape velocity from this place achieve escape velocity from this place uh and go somewhere else where you can uh and go somewhere else where you can have a better quality of life I have a better quality of life I mean what role do you see for yourself mean what role do you see for yourself and how involved do you want to be I and how involved do you want to be I think about it quite a think about it quite a lot that's where I think my the next lot that's where I think my the next question is also so in your book you as question is also so in your book you as you said you go to a Sam and then CA NRC you said you go to a Sam and then CA NRC there's a history with the Northeast there's a history with the Northeast borders but today there is also a bigger borders but today there is also a bigger problem or a big problem enough as problem or a big problem enough as compared to other problems as well which compared to other problems as well which is delimitation delimitation which is is delimitation delimitation which is connected to census census to adhar NPR connected to census census to adhar NPR NRC CA Etc my question is not about what NRC CA Etc my question is not about what would adhar do or in that sense but um would adhar do or in that sense but um as a reporter um when you talk to people as a reporter um when you talk to people and even today when you go to many parts and even today when you go to many parts of the of the of the country what is it that has country what is it that has fundamentally changed in India in the fundamentally changed in India in the say let let's say it's not about from say let let's say it's not about from 2014 let's say in last four five decades 2014 let's say in last four five decades and where do you see this this is and where do you see this this is Unstoppable now this machine is Unstoppable now this machine is Unstoppable so where do you see this Unstoppable so where do you see this going as a reporter I honestly see uh a going as a reporter I honestly see uh a certain fragmenting of reality um in certain fragmenting of reality um in people's minds they're really not able people's minds they're really not able to process the significance of what's to process the significance of what's happening in this country um and I I happening in this country um and I I think at some level it's it's because of think at some level it's it's because of the information they receive and how the information they receive and how they receive it um the idea of a shared they receive it um the idea of a shared reality is something that that that reality is something that that that seems to be broken um where if you point seems to be broken um where if you point out you say I have been to a place and I out you say I have been to a place and I have seen this with my own have seen this with my own eyes and you write about eyes and you write about it they rightly they would look for bias it they rightly they would look for bias as they should but there is a certain as they should but there is a certain disbelief about it like I not well not disbelief about it like I not well not disbelief that's a wrong word but they disbelief that's a wrong word but they they just do they just do not believe that something like that not believe that something like that could happen they do not trust the could happen they do not trust the messenger they question the messenger messenger they question the messenger rather than turning their ey towards rather than turning their ey towards leaders towards rulers so that is leaders towards rulers so that is something that I something that that is something that I I saw I witnessed up close I saw people I saw I witnessed up close I saw people just not able to to ask that question of just not able to to ask that question of why this is happening around them the why this is happening around them the violence against Muslims for example I violence against Muslims for example I didn't hear from too many people who didn't hear from too many people who thought that it was wrong that they it's thought that it was wrong that they it's almost like they were justifying they almost like they were justifying the the cruelty in their were justifying the the cruelty in their minds and they were like yes all of this minds and they were like yes all of this is happening for a reason it is is happening for a reason it is happening because Muslims are this way happening because Muslims are this way that is what they would tell me and and that is what they would tell me and and when when I heard these things I would when when I heard these things I would find myself wondering what has what has find myself wondering what has what has gotten into you what are you being fed gotten into you what are you being fed what kind of what kind of world are you what kind of world are you existing in and I saw I saw that I saw existing in and I saw I saw that over and over again they didn't that over and over again they didn't they didn't really see you know they they didn't really see you know they they said like Muslims kind of stick they said like Muslims kind of stick together they would say stuff like that together they would say stuff like that oh they have their own community that oh they have their own community that place is dirty you would hear words like place is dirty you would hear words like that but they wouldn't connect it back that but they wouldn't connect it back to themselves the fact to themselves the fact that in many that in many instances they or their friends or their instances they or their friends or their family would oppose letting out a house family would oppose letting out a house to a Muslim on rent you know and so to a Muslim on rent you know and so people have to move they have to gather people have to move they have to gather and there is safety in numbers and so and there is safety in numbers and so you have places like like Okla like you you have places like like Okla like you know outside outside jamama where when I know outside outside jamama where when I had these late night walks and had these late night walks and conversations with people they just said conversations with people they just said we feel we feel safe over here we feel we feel safe over here because the nonsense that can afflict because the nonsense that can afflict them outside can't over here so you're them outside can't over here so you're seeing a fragmentation and that seeing a fragmentation and that fragmentation is not just in the mind fragmentation is not just in the mind but it's actually along and it's not but it's actually along and it's not just along lines of cast it's not along just along lines of cast it's not along lines of religion it's also along lines lines of religion it's also along lines of ideology it's along lines of of ideology it's along lines of profession like the moment you you profession like the moment you you moment you say you're a journalist or moment you say you're a journalist or you say that I work over here at this you say that I work over here at this particular paper you're marked as particular paper you're marked as somebody who's oh yeah you're this is somebody who's oh yeah you're this is how you think this is what you do do how you think this is what you do do rather than looking at the work itself rather than looking at the work itself and what what it all means and so you and what what it all means and so you you see this kind of fragmentation you see this kind of fragmentation you're you're seeing it for example I'll you're you're seeing it for example I'll just take you know look at the farmer just take you know look at the farmer protests and look at the way people protests and look at the way people reacted to them the words khalistani the reacted to them the words khalistani the words anti-national the usual the usual words anti-national the usual the usual stuff that is that is thrown at people stuff that is that is thrown at people you see a kind of division instead of you see a kind of division instead of empathy instead of sympathy for somebody empathy instead of sympathy for somebody else's problems but that's also Rahul as else's problems but that's also Rahul as a country itself you've had a history of a country itself you've had a history of cast and religious I mean communal cast and religious I mean communal related massacres as well um apathy in related massacres as well um apathy in one sense has perhaps been part of not one sense has perhaps been part of not just India but then South Asian culture just India but then South Asian culture also right thus thus I mean what what also right thus thus I mean what what what is sharpened you think it's just what is sharpened you think it's just this these divisions or it's also the this these divisions or it's also the way in which people are forced to exist way in which people are forced to exist in their own fantasies and realities in their own fantasies and realities also I think it's just how widespread it also I think it's just how widespread it is and how open it is is and how open it is now that's the thing I mean it's it's now that's the thing I mean it's it's open there's no mistaking it there's no open there's no mistaking it there's no there's no denying it there's no it there's no denying it there's no it doesn't exist in the shadows it doesn't doesn't exist in the shadows it doesn't exist in a gray area it's there out in exist in a gray area it's there out in the open for you to see people are the open for you to see people are saying these things and it's not just saying these things and it's not just adults it's children it's all over the adults it's children it's all over the place and I I think when I when I went place and I I think when I when I went around you're checking the temp around you're checking the temp temperature in some way um when you when temperature in some way um when you when you go out and you're reporting you you go out and you're reporting you would expect that after the last 10 12 would expect that after the last 10 12 years where things have gotten years where things have gotten particularly bad for certain communities particularly bad for certain communities for Muslims for for others you would for Muslims for for others you would imagine that there would be more people imagine that there would be more people pushing back against pushing back against that I don't I didn't see that and I in that I don't I didn't see that and I in fact saw that there were people fighting fact saw that there were people fighting their individual ual their individual ual fights and they were they were by fights and they were
