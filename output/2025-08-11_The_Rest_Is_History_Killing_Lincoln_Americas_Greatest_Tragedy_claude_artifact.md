**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. Lincoln's Second Inauguration and Vision for Peace

***"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether - with malice toward none, with charity for all."***

The second inauguration on March 4, 1865, marked a supreme moment of triumph with Lincoln becoming the first president to win re-election since Andrew Jackson in 1832. Victory for the Union was mere weeks away, yet the inaugural address contained **no triumphalism, no boasting, no sense of exaltation**. The speech emphasized humility before God's divine plan, sadness at the war's cost, and a focus on union and reconciliation. Lincoln's biographer Michael Burlingame noted this as one of his greatest speeches, while The Spectator in England praised it as worthy of Oliver Cromwell.

The inauguration itself descended into chaos - Vice President Andrew Johnson, weakened by typhoid, drank three glasses of brandy and delivered an interminable, rambling speech, forgetting names and slobbering over the Bible. The New York World reported he "defiled our council chamber with the spewings of a drunken bore." The inaugural banquet saw crowds pushing tables, snatching whole turkeys, smashing crockery, and pouring food over each other's heads. Despite the chaos, Lincoln made a point of welcoming Frederick Douglass, the Black abolitionist who had been initially turned away, publicly shaking his hand in a significant gesture.

## 2. The Final Military Campaign and Lee's Surrender

***"It seems to me that I've been dreaming a horrid dream for four years, and now the nightmare is gone."***

By early 1865, the Union's massive economic and industrial advantages, marshaled by Ulysses S. Grant, had begun to tell decisively. The capture of Atlanta in late 1864 and Sherman's march to the sea had torn through Confederate economic and transport networks. The Confederates' last hope - that Lincoln would lose re-election to Democrat George McClellan who wanted a negotiated settlement - vanished with Lincoln's comfortable victory in November.

On April 2, 1865, the Confederates evacuated their capital Richmond, Virginia. The next day, Confederate defenses at Petersburg broke, forcing Robert E. Lee's army to retreat across the Appomattox River. **On April 9, at Appomattox Courthouse, Lee signed the instrument of surrender** in the McLean farmhouse, with Grant's adjutant Ely Parker, a Seneca Indian, writing out the document. When Lee remarked it was good to have "one real American" present, Parker responded, "Sir, we're all Americans."

## 3. Lincoln's Historic Visit to Richmond

***"Don't kneel to me - kneel to God only."***

On April 4, 1865, just two days after Confederate evacuation, Lincoln visited the fallen Confederate capital with his 12-year-old son Tad. The scene was extraordinary - **thousands of formerly enslaved people rushed to greet their liberator**, shouting "Hallelujah! Bless the Lord!" Journalists described the emotion as beyond written description, with dancing, thanksgivings, and overwhelming joy. When they knelt before him, Lincoln demonstrated remarkable dignity, telling them to kneel only to God.

Walking through the war-torn city with smoldering buildings and smoke, Lincoln passed an elderly Black man in rags who blessed him as "Master President Lincoln." **Lincoln removed his hat and bowed to this man** - a gesture that astonished observers. Charles Coffin of the Boston Journal called it "a death shock to chivalry and a mortal wound to caste." At the Confederate White House, Lincoln sat briefly in Jefferson Davis's chair but declined to tour the private apartments, saying it wouldn't be right to tour another man's home. He addressed the freed slaves in Capitol Square: ***"You are free, free as air. Liberty is your birthright. God gave it to you as he gave it to others. It's a sin that you have been deprived of it for so many years."***

## 4. The Reconstruction Debate and Black Suffrage

***"I think it is time to give the vote to some of our black fellow citizens - I would prefer it were conferred on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers."***

The political landscape was intensely faction-ridden over two existential questions: **what to do about slavery and how to handle the rebel states**. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery had passed the House and states were beginning ratification. Lincoln struck a conciliatory tone, even offering compensation to Southern slaveholders for their losses if they rejoined the Union - he feared anarchy in the South more than anything.

The radical Republicans demanded harsh punishment for traitors, while moderates and Democrats wanted quick readmission of Southern states. **Nearly 200,000 Black Americans had served in the Union Army**, and Lincoln privately believed it unreasonable to ask them to fight and die without granting them voting rights afterward. On April 11, 1865, Lincoln made his final speech, publicly endorsing limited Black suffrage for the first time - specifically for the intelligent and those who served as soldiers. This gradualist approach was typical of Lincoln's political strategy, moving slowly but steadily toward more radical positions.

## 5. Mary Todd Lincoln's Volatile Behavior

***"Mrs. Lincoln was the greatest tragedy of Mr. Lincoln's existence."***

Mary Todd Lincoln's behavior during the war's final weeks shocked military officers and their wives. When Julia Grant sat down without invitation, Mary shrieked, "How dare you be seated until I invite you!" A friend described her as "insanely jealous of every person and everything." When General Ord's attractive wife rode next to Lincoln, Mary publicly berated her, calling her vile names and asking "what she meant by following up the president." The poor woman burst into tears while officers watched in horror.

Mary repeatedly attacked her husband in front of officers. One observer noted Lincoln bore it "with an expression of pain and sadness which cut one to the heart but with supreme calmness and dignity." General Carl Schurz declared Mary "the greatest tragedy of Mr. Lincoln's existence." When crowds cheered Grant instead of Lincoln during a carriage ride, she demanded the driver stop and let her out, unable to bear people chanting Grant's name over her husband's.

## 6. John Wilkes Booth: Actor Turned Assassin

***"That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds."***

Born in Maryland in May 1838, John Wilkes Booth was the illegitimate son of Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth (named after Caesar's assassin) and his mistress Mary Anne Holmes. The stigma of illegitimacy haunted him throughout life. At 26, Booth was **not a failed actor but a genuine star** - handsome, athletic, known for his theatrical leaps and acrobatics that drove female audiences wild with excitement. He had played Richard III, Romeo, Hamlet, Brutus, and Mark Antony.

Booth was pathologically racist, having written that slavery was brilliant and he'd seen slaves whipped "but only when they really deserved it and never as much as they deserved." He called abolitionists traitors who should be "stamped to death" and wished he could "grind them into dust." Despite his Confederate sympathies, he never fought - he'd promised his mother he wouldn't, making him both a racist and a coward. As Confederate defeats mounted, he drank heavily, couldn't sleep, and focused his rage entirely on Lincoln, whom he compared to both Napoleon and Julius Caesar attempting to destroy the republic.

## 7. The Assassination Plot Takes Shape

***"A man could immortalize himself by killing Lincoln - I want to do something that will mean I'm remembered for all time."***

Initially, Booth planned to kidnap Lincoln from his summer cottage and exchange him for Confederate prisoners, possibly as part of a wider Confederate conspiracy involving agents like John Surratt, whose mother Mary ran a Washington boarding house serving as a Confederate safe house. The kidnapping scheme involved multiple conspirators but never materialized.

After hearing of Richmond's fall and Lee's surrender, Booth shifted from kidnapping to assassination. On the morning of April 14, Good Friday, Booth learned at Ford's Theatre that Lincoln would attend that evening's performance of "Our American Cousin." He immediately made three preparations: **hired a horse with a white star from Mr. Pumphrey's stable, gave Mary Surratt a mysterious package to hide at her Maryland tavern, and contacted three conspirators** - George Atzerodt (German carriage repairman), David Herold (pharmacist's assistant), and Lewis Powell (former Confederate soldier).

## 8. Lincoln's Final Day

***"For the first time, I really feel as though the war is over - we must both be more cheerful in the future."***

On Good Friday morning, April 14, 1865, Lincoln held his final cabinet meeting with Grant present. He insisted on clemency for the South: **"We must extinguish our resentments if we expect harmony and union. No bloody work."** He wanted Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis (whom he called "Jeffy D") to flee the country rather than face prosecution. Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch noted Lincoln had never seemed happier - "the burden had been lifted."

During an afternoon carriage ride with Mary (remarkably without argument), Lincoln spoke optimistically about the future, mentioning their son Willie who died of typhoid: "Between the war and the loss of our darling Willie, we have been very miserable." The Lincolns planned to attend Ford's Theatre that evening, though Grant and his wife refused to go - Julia Grant couldn't bear another encounter with Mary Lincoln. They were replaced by Clara Harris and her fiancé Major Henry Rathbone.

Lincoln traveled with minimal security - just policeman John Parker and messenger Charles Forbes, not professional bodyguards. He had repeatedly refused protection, saying "I will not be shut up in an iron cage" and asking "Who would want to kill me?" No successful assassination had occurred in American history, and Secretary of State William Seward had declared in 1862 that "assassination is not an American practice or habit."

The Lincolns arrived at Ford's Theatre at 9:00 PM, twenty minutes after the play began. Their box (boxes 7 and 8 knocked together) was conspicuously decorated with American flags. The play stopped, the band played "Hail to the Chief," and the audience applauded. At 10:15 PM, as actor Harry Hawk delivered the line "you sockdologizing old man-trap" to enormous laughter, the door to Lincoln's box swung open, and John Wilkes Booth stood in the doorway.
