DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
Every day we draw in two thousand gallons of airâ€”and thousands of living things. From the ground to the stratosphere, the air teems with invisible life. This last great biological frontier remains so mysterious that it took over two years for scientists to finally agree that the Covid pandemic was caused by an airborne virus.

In Air-Borne, award-winning New York Times columnist and author Carl Zimmer leads us on an odyssey through the living atmosphere and through the history of its discovery. We travel to the tops of mountain glaciers, where Louis Pasteur caught germs from the air, and follow Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh above the clouds, where they conducted groundbreaking experiments. We meet the long-forgotten pioneers of aerobiology including William and Mildred Wells, who tried for decades to warn the world about airborne infections, only to die in obscurity.

Air-Borne chronicles the dark side of aerobiology with gripping accounts of how the United States and the Soviet

hi I can't tell you how happy I am to hi I can't tell you how happy I am to see you uh people who are interested in see you uh people who are interested in science lately I've been feeling a science lately I've been feeling a little sad and and I have to say that little sad and and I have to say that you're making me feel really happy um I you're making me feel really happy um I did write an introduction so I'm gon did write an introduction so I'm gon to not read to not read it um I'm Melissa Franklin I'm a it um I'm Melissa Franklin I'm a particle physicist who works over here particle physicist who works over here that way and uh and so uh it's like the that way and uh and so uh it's like the Harvard bookstore which is the Harvard bookstore which is the independent independent independent one and uh the division of Science and one and uh the division of Science and the Harvard libraries got together uh the Harvard libraries got together uh and have this program called the Harvard and have this program called the Harvard science book talks and we have a couple science book talks and we have a couple one or two every month and uh you can one or two every month and uh you can look on the bookstore website for them look on the bookstore website for them or we'll or you can sign up outside and or we'll or you can sign up outside and we'll send you uh about these talks so we'll send you uh about these talks so um we really like this because I really um we really like this because I really like the people from the bookstore and I like the people from the bookstore and I don't they don't usually talk to me when don't they don't usually talk to me when I just buy books I don't know why really I just buy books I don't know why really it's maybe the clothes I'm wearing it's maybe the clothes I'm wearing anyway anyway anyway um so what we're trying to do with this um so what we're trying to do with this series is bring science to the community series is bring science to the community and then now it's more important than and then now it's more important than ever um so I want to talk about Carl's ever um so I want to talk about Carl's book but I'm not I'm not going to book but I'm not I'm not going to because Carl's going to talk about his because Carl's going to talk about his book um but I do want to just uh say book um but I do want to just uh say that um you know after that um you know after this uh talk there will be time for this uh talk there will be time for questions and you will have a microphone questions and you will have a microphone if you want and you can ask questions if you want and you can ask questions and then you never know Carl might and then you never know Carl might answer them but right after that we're answer them but right after that we're going to scoot over to the cabit library going to scoot over to the cabit library where there will be little things to eat where there will be little things to eat I don't know how little they will be but I don't know how little they will be but they will not be at the atomic they will not be at the atomic level um but they may be things that you level um but they may be things that you find in the centrifuge here uh which find in the centrifuge here uh which Carl is going to talk about it um anyway Carl is going to talk about it um anyway you can come over there and the great you can come over there and the great thing about being over there is there's thing about being over there is there's a little place where Carl will sit and a little place where Carl will sit and sign the books you buy from the sign the books you buy from the Independent Harvard Independent Harvard Independent Harvard bookstore uh and buy two for a friend bookstore uh and buy two for a friend buy buy three don't get it on the buy buy three don't get it on the Kindle sorry you can get it on the Kindle sorry you can get it on the Kindle um okay so I don't really know Kindle um okay so I don't really know Carl but I did meet him once and I want Carl but I did meet him once and I want to tell you where I met him because it to tell you where I met him because it was important there was a conference for was important there was a conference for undergraduate women in physics at Yale undergraduate women in physics at Yale one year and these are conferences that one year and these are conferences that used to take place and hope hopefully used to take place and hope hopefully they still will everywhere in the in the they still will everywhere in the in the country uh once a year and Carl was country uh once a year and Carl was giving a talk and someone had told me giving a talk and someone had told me that he was um interesting and I went to that he was um interesting and I went to the talk and there were a lot of the talk and there were a lot of undergrads and then there was just me undergrads and then there was just me and I was old I was older then than I am and I was old I was older then than I am now sorry and Carl gave the most amazing now sorry and Carl gave the most amazing talk talk about being a science writer talk talk about being a science writer and and a little bit about how he got and and a little bit about how he got there but more about what it was like there but more about what it was like and what you did and by the end I was and what you did and by the end I was thinking okay um I I'm going to retire thinking okay um I I'm going to retire my shingle my shingle presently says uh my shingle my shingle presently says uh try and find out everything you can try and find out everything you can about the vacuum of the about the vacuum of the universe and I was going to retire that universe and I was going to retire that and just become a science writer but I and just become a science writer but I have written anything in that I think have written anything in that I think that was 10 years that was 10 years ago now Carl is different because he's ago now Carl is different because he's written about a book every 18 months for written about a book every 18 months for the past 25 years the past 25 years so well that's the difference so I'm so well that's the difference so I'm still looking at the the universe which still looking at the the universe which is is is sad um anyhow I think what's kind of sad um anyhow I think what's kind of also really cool about Carl is this too also really cool about Carl is this too long and it's weird that I don't know long and it's weird that I don't know him and I'm talking as if I do I guess I him and I'm talking as if I do I guess I should say Mr should say Mr Zimmer is that he's he he he's not a Zimmer is that he's he he he's not a scientist like he like he doesn't have scientist like he like he doesn't have he's not a card carrying scientist like he's not a card carrying scientist like which means what most people think is which means what most people think is that he didn't go to college and study that he didn't go to college and study science he studied English literature science he studied English literature which we're happy about because that which we're happy about because that then we like to read his books um but then we like to read his books um but has learned so much science and has learned so much science and describes it so well that it kind of describes it so well that it kind of makes me happy I like this this is the makes me happy I like this this is the real idea of inclusion real idea of inclusion to me I guess I'm not sure whether I can to me I guess I'm not sure whether I can say that can say that can you we just take the inclusion you we just take the inclusion out um I think it's you know the great thing um I think it's you know the great thing about being a science writer is that you about being a science writer is that you get to look at a whole bunch of diverse get to look at a whole bunch of diverse scientific Explorations take that one scientific Explorations take that one out um so anyhow I will just be very out um so anyhow I will just be very quick here Carl's not young but he's not quick here Carl's not young but he's not old you can see him here old you can see him here and uh and he studied at Yale um and he and uh and he studied at Yale um and he studied English uh and he's a New York studied English uh and he's a New York Times columnist science columnist so Times columnist science columnist so maybe you've maybe that's why you're maybe you've maybe that's why you're here maybe you read the New York Times here maybe you read the New York Times and I just want to uh read some of the and I just want to uh read some of the titles of his books in case you want to titles of his books in case you want to go to the Harvard bookstore directly go to the Harvard bookstore directly from here and just buy all of them but I from here and just buy all of them but I not sure they're in stock um starts with not sure they're in stock um starts with starting with the water's edge you can starting with the water's edge you can sort of feel like what that's about sort of feel like what that's about maybe something happened there at the 's maybe something happened there at the 's Edge Evolution where did we come from Edge Evolution where did we come from and then he also wrote apparently The and then he also wrote apparently The Descent of Man which he wrote with Descent of Man which he wrote with Charles Darwin I like that sorry I would Charles Darwin I like that sorry I would always want to write a book with Charles always want to write a book with Charles Darwin um a planet of viruses she has Darwin um a planet of viruses she has her mother's her mother's her mother's laugh life Edge the search for what it laugh life Edge the search for what it means to be alive and now finally he's means to be alive and now finally he's written a incredibly beautiful book I written a incredibly beautiful book I think uh Airborne the hidden history of think uh Airborne the hidden history of the life we breathe and here it is here the life we breathe and here it is here and you can buy copies at and you can buy copies at upstairs um he has also won a huge upstairs um he has also won a huge number of prizes and I'm not going to number of prizes and I'm not going to talk about them because the only one talk about them because the only one that's interesting is the one that has that's interesting is the one that has to do with to do with Harvard I'm sorry it's not true uh but Harvard I'm sorry it's not true uh but he did win the Steph Jay gold prize Well he did win the Steph Jay gold prize Well he Stephen J gold was at Harvard so and he Stephen J gold was at Harvard so and the other thing he has which I don't the other thing he has which I don't have and will never have and I don't have and will never have and I don't want to talk about it much but he has an want to talk about it much but he has an asteroid named after him it is asteroid named after him it is 21273 Carl 21273 Carl 21273 Carl Zimmer that's the asteroid that's not Zimmer that's the asteroid that's not going to hit Earth um and anyhow I can going to hit Earth um and anyhow I can tell you one thing I'm not I've never tell you one thing I'm not I've never reviewed a book in my life but I can reviewed a book in my life but I can tell you when I was reading this book I tell you when I was reading this book I felt like I was in conversation with felt like I was in conversation with Carl Zimmer I felt like he left me lots Carl Zimmer I felt like he left me lots of room to think and ask questions and of room to think and ask questions and then almost immediately he would answer then almost immediately he would answer the questions even though he didn't know the questions even though he didn't know he was doing that so it's incred it's he was doing that so it's incred it's just like you just read it and it's done just like you just read it and it's done and you have all kinds of thoughts so I and you have all kinds of thoughts so I think it's well worth uh reading even if think it's well worth uh reading even if you steal you steal you steal it um but the best part of all and this it um but the best part of all and this may be for the physicist in the room may be for the physicist in the room there is a tension between physicist and there is a tension between physicist and biologists he writes about which I love biologists he writes about which I love I love that tension and so Carl Zimmer all right thank you very much Zimmer all right thank you very much Melissa thank you all for coming out uh Melissa thank you all for coming out uh um you know I I'm sure for some of you um you know I I'm sure for some of you it you know the idea of you know just it you know the idea of you know just getting up and going out and doing getting up and going out and doing something might be kind of challenging something might be kind of challenging right now given the mood you might be in right now given the mood you might be in uh so thanks for being here um you know uh so thanks for being here um you know uh I've been working on this book for uh uh I've been working on this book for uh several years now and you know when you several years now and you know when you start writing a book um you don't know start writing a book um you don't know what the world will be like when it what the world will be like when it actually comes out so when I started on actually comes out so when I started on Airborne um you know I what I was doing Airborne um you know I what I was doing it was setting out to to write a history it was setting out to to write a history of our of our long slow very difficult of our of our long slow very difficult realization that the air around us is realization that the air around us is alive uh and um it's it's taken alive uh and um it's it's taken centuries for us to really start to centuries for us to really start to appreciate it and I would argue in the appreciate it and I would argue in the book we don't appreciate it enough yet book we don't appreciate it enough yet um but I I would not have predicted when um but I I would not have predicted when I started working on the book that uh I started working on the book that uh when it came out we would have uh really when it came out we would have uh really expensive expensive expensive eggs thanks to bird flu uh which is also eggs thanks to bird flu uh which is also running rampant in cows and cats in this running rampant in cows and cats in this country uh and is you know threatening country uh and is you know threatening to become a a human pandemic I I to become a a human pandemic I I wouldn't have predicted that a a human wouldn't have predicted that a a human pandemic where the concern is that too pandemic where the concern is that too might become might become might become airborne um I I would not have predicted airborne um I I would not have predicted that the government would currently be that the government would currently be decimating the ranks of the people whose decimating the ranks of the people whose job it is to monitor bird flu but that's job it is to monitor bird flu but that's what's happening right now um I would what's happening right now um I would not have uh predicted that uh the not have uh predicted that uh the National Institutes of Health the National Institutes of Health the centers of Disease Control would be centers of Disease Control would be undergoing massive layoffs right now uh undergoing massive layoffs right now uh I would not have predicted that the I would not have predicted that the government would actually be uh wiping government would actually be uh wiping out so much funding that I'm not sure out so much funding that I'm not sure how much of the research I'm going to be how much of the research I'm going to be telling you about is going to be carried telling you about is going to be carried on in the near on in the near future would never predicted any of future would never predicted any of this but the goal of writing a book is this but the goal of writing a book is is to just to try to set something down is to just to try to set something down that's going to be meaningful when it that's going to be meaningful when it finally comes out and will you hope stay finally comes out and will you hope stay meaningful in 5 years or 10 years or meaningful in 5 years or 10 years or even even even longer so so I hope that the story I'm longer so so I hope that the story I'm going to tell you uh tonight which much going to tell you uh tonight which much of which happened nearly a century ago of which happened nearly a century ago um is actually very vital to what's um is actually very vital to what's happening right happening right happening right now so um the story and the story has to now so um the story and the story has to do with this this is a very very special do with this this is a very very special object that I'm actually very excited to object that I'm actually very excited to lay my eyes on for the first time and lay my eyes on for the first time and I'm going to tell you about what this I'm going to tell you about what this is so is so is so so cast your mind back about 90 years um so cast your mind back about 90 years um it's late it's late it's late 1934 it's a cold day in 1934 it's a cold day in Boston there are a group of students who Boston there are a group of students who are enrolled in a class on sanitation are enrolled in a class on sanitation that is you know keeping People that is you know keeping People Protected from infectious diseases um Protected from infectious diseases um and they're all going into a Hall at the and they're all going into a Hall at the Harvard School of Public Health so not Harvard School of Public Health so not very far from where we are right very far from where we are right now now the class is now now the class is taught by this guy 47y old man named taught by this guy 47y old man named William fth William fth William fth Wells and he is assisted by a Wells and he is assisted by a 23-year-old uh medical school student 23-year-old uh medical school student Harvard Medical School student named Harvard Medical School student named Richard Wy this is when he's much much Richard Wy this is when he's much much older older older obviously um now I can say with some obviously um now I can say with some confidence having done a lot of research confidence having done a lot of research on this particular event that it was a on this particular event that it was a terrible lecture uh I have actually found in lecture uh I have actually found in archives you know written comments about archives you know written comments about Wells as a teacher uh and they're none Wells as a teacher uh and they're none of them are of them are good uh this is what the dean of the good uh this is what the dean of the Harvard School of Public dean of the Harvard School of Public Health said at the time he said this is Health said at the time he said this is the type of work Wells does extremely the type of work Wells does extremely badly in badly in badly in print anyway so on this so uh as for print anyway so on this so uh as for Riley um you know he was you know being Riley um you know he was you know being an assistant and helping Wells out he an assistant and helping Wells out he was probably attending to this device was probably attending to this device right here um Riley actually came to right here um Riley actually came to Harvard College with dreams of becoming Harvard College with dreams of becoming a musician a piano player um I suspect a musician a piano player um I suspect that when the Great Depression came uh that when the Great Depression came uh he started to to think differently he he started to to think differently he went to medical school he didn't have went to medical school he didn't have enough money so he needed a job so he enough money so he needed a job so he became uh uh an assistant to Wells along became uh uh an assistant to Wells along with his brother Edward Riley um and with his brother Edward Riley um and Richard Riley loved it so Wells might be Richard Riley loved it so Wells might be a terrible teacher and all his colleague a terrible teacher and all his colleague said he's politely said he was very said he's politely said he was very peculiar um but Riley called him quoting peculiar um but Riley called him quoting here a wizard whom I found here a wizard whom I found irresistible so this was a a man who irresistible so this was a a man who drew very strong opinions from drew very strong opinions from people now um so what is people now um so what is this this is something called the wells this this is something called the wells a a a centrifuge this is actually the only centrifuge this is actually the only only well centrifuge that at least I only well centrifuge that at least I know of that still exists uh and is know of that still exists uh and is actually come to Harvard come home to actually come to Harvard come home to Harvard to be in a collection here um Harvard to be in a collection here um and so this has been this just happened and so this has been this just happened and I'm very excited to to see this um and I'm very excited to to see this um and so I want to tell you about what and so I want to tell you about what happened so Riley and Wells they bring happened so Riley and Wells they bring this thing into that lecture hall this thing into that lecture hall okay and they plug it in and now Wells okay and they plug it in and now Wells is talking for a while about is talking for a while about uh about uh sanitation talking about the uh about uh sanitation talking about the germ theory of disease probably talking germ theory of disease probably talking about like typhoid and contaminated about like typhoid and contaminated water so then about 20 minutes before water so then about 20 minutes before the end of the end of class well stops his class well stops his lecture he comes over and he turns on lecture he comes over and he turns on this this this thing now there's a shaft that rotates thing now there's a shaft that rotates and it starts spinning there are little and it starts spinning there are little fan blades at the top fan blades at the top so this thing is woring away I don't so this thing is woring away I don't know if he actually explained to them know if he actually explained to them what he was doing he would be the sort what he was doing he would be the sort of person to just do it and not tell of person to just do it and not tell anybody sorry I anybody sorry I am I'm sorry the person for the museum am I'm sorry the person for the museum is here and I think he just had a heart is here and I think he just had a heart attack I'm gonna go over attack I'm gonna go over here so so so so um uh so Riley probably here so so so so um uh so Riley probably switches this on now switches this on now um he now what they also do just is if um he now what they also do just is if you can see over on the other side there you can see over on the other side there are some glass are some glass cylinders so they would take one of cylinders so they would take one of these glass cylinders and fit it up these glass cylinders and fit it up inside the the the cylindrical shaft um inside the the the cylindrical shaft um you can see I think they're holding one you can see I think they're holding one of the cylinders there in the photograph of the cylinders there in the photograph so so now these cylinders are very so so now these cylinders are very interesting they're coated with a sort interesting they're coated with a sort of sticky substance that includes among of sticky substance that includes among other things human other things human blood now this bizarre Contraption is blood now this bizarre Contraption is woring away now as if that wasn't weird woring away now as if that wasn't weird enough William Wells pulls out a jar of enough William Wells pulls out a jar of sneezing sneezing sneezing powder he walks over and there's an powder he walks over and there's an there's s an outlet where the air is there's s an outlet where the air is coming out at the top and he just coming out at the top and he just sprinkles it and the sneezing powder sprinkles it and the sneezing powder sort of drifts away towards one wall now sort of drifts away towards one wall now bear in mind it's a cold day the windows bear in mind it's a cold day the windows are shut the doors are shut so there's are shut the doors are shut so there's not a lot of ventilation in this space not a lot of ventilation in this space so the air that's in here pretty much so the air that's in here pretty much stays in stays in stays in here not surprisingly maybe uh people here not surprisingly maybe uh people start to sneeze after a while like in start to sneeze after a while like in the back they start to the back they start to sneeze so he lets this thing run sneeze so he lets this thing run um and uh after a while he shuts the um and uh after a while he shuts the machine off okay he takes out that machine off okay he takes out that cylinder and then puts in another one cylinder and then puts in another one now the sneezing is stopped and he goes now the sneezing is stopped and he goes on with with the lecture on with with the lecture uh and then class is over everybody uh and then class is over everybody leaves probably wondering like what was leaves probably wondering like what was that that that about and then he puts in a third about and then he puts in a third cylinder and each time the cylinder is cylinder and each time the cylinder is gets to spin for about 10 minutes okay gets to spin for about 10 minutes okay so there's right when he right when he so there's right when he puts the sneezing Potter into the room puts the sneezing Potter into the room you've got one cylinder running 10 you've got one cylinder running 10 minutes later another cylinder and then minutes later another cylinder and then after everyone leaves another after everyone leaves another cylinder um now Riley takes those those cylinder um now Riley takes those those cylinders out and takes them back to a cylinders out and takes them back to a lab and for a few days he keeps them in lab and for a few days he keeps them in a very warm incubator and waits to see a very warm incubator and waits to see if anything if anything if anything grows and things do grow grows and things do grow specifically it he starts to the the he specifically it he starts to the the he starts to grow colonies of starts to grow colonies of bacteria that grow in our mouths that's bacteria that grow in our mouths that's why there was human blood in the uh in why there was human blood in the uh in the cylinders because they had figured the cylinders because they had figured out that this particular concoction out that this particular concoction would get this particular kind of would get this particular kind of bacteria to bacteria to bacteria to grow and so what it happened was grow and so what it happened was that you know the sneezing powder had that you know the sneezing powder had gone out into the room people had gone out into the room people had sneezed they had sneezed out this sneezed they had sneezed out this harmless bacteria in their mouths that harmless bacteria in their mouths that had floated and had come over here and had floated and had come over here and as it went up got sucked up through the as it went up got sucked up through the air centrifuge the bacteria got air centrifuge the bacteria got flung onto the walls of these flung onto the walls of these cylinders so the first cind cylinders so the first cind cylinder there were no colonies in the cylinder there were no colonies in the second cylinder there were 2,200 second cylinder there were 2,200 colonies and the third cylinder at the colonies and the third cylinder at the end of class there were 920 end of class there were 920 colonies and so the way that Wells colonies and so the way that Wells described this later he said a practical described this later he said a practical joke was turned into a conclusive joke was turned into a conclusive experiment uh you see Wells had been experiment uh you see Wells had been developing a theory for how diseases developing a theory for how diseases spread over long distances in the air spread over long distances in the air and this demonstration with an air cfug and this demonstration with an air cfug just like this showed how it worked just like this showed how it worked because what was happening is because what was happening is that when you when you sneeze or even that when you when you sneeze or even when you breathe you release little when you breathe you release little droplets now if you sneeze and you droplets now if you sneeze and you sneeze like a big droplets a lot of them sneeze like a big droplets a lot of them might fall to the ground or the floor might fall to the ground or the floor very very very soon but smaller ones can Flo further soon but smaller ones can Flo further and also these droplets are evaporating and also these droplets are evaporating as they hit dry air so they might get as they hit dry air so they might get small enough to be able to then float small enough to be able to then float and Wells called these in particular and Wells called these in particular droplet droplet droplet nuclei and so the droplet nuclei had nuclei and so the droplet nuclei had wandered all the way to the air wandered all the way to the air centrifuge where he scooped them up um centrifuge where he scooped them up um and so you know for Wells you know he he and so you know for Wells you know he he he saw this as this cycle where like he saw this as this cycle where like sneezing patter comes out and then sneezing patter comes out and then bacteria come back he wrote a perfect bacteria come back he wrote a perfect cycle was thus completed now you've all just been been completed now you've all just been been through a through a through a pandemic you have been through a pandemic you have been through a pandemic with an Airborne virus that pandemic with an Airborne virus that causes covid so you might be thinking to causes covid so you might be thinking to yourself why have I not heard of these yourself why have I not heard of these people um and you know why why have you people um and you know why why have you not heard about this particular not heard about this particular experiment how is this possible and experiment how is this possible and that's part of what I write about in the that's part of what I write about in the book is um how it is that um science book is um how it is that um science took this very strange and really took this very strange and really unfortunate pth unfortunate pth unfortunate pth that there were incredible insights that that there were incredible insights that were made almost a century ago and then were made almost a century ago and then lost and then lost and then rediscovered rediscovered rediscovered um to understand uh this and how this um to understand uh this and how this happened I actually want to just jump happened I actually want to just jump back uh actually a couple thousand back uh actually a couple thousand years because the thing is the air has years because the thing is the air has always been captivating and mysterious always been captivating and mysterious to us you know long before we knew that to us you know long before we knew that it was made of oxygen and nitrogen it was made of oxygen and nitrogen um we we needed air to live obviously um we we needed air to live obviously but the air would also could be but the air would also could be sometimes seem kind of treacherous to us sometimes seem kind of treacherous to us you know maybe a dust storm would come you know maybe a dust storm would come along maybe some foul OD odors would along maybe some foul OD odors would come our way and so very early on uh come our way and so very early on uh people like Epocrates would say that people like Epocrates would say that oh this kind of Corruption of the air a oh this kind of Corruption of the air a my Asma is the cause of many my Asma is the cause of many diseases the reason that a lot of people diseases the reason that a lot of people in a particular place all start to get in a particular place all start to get sick with some disease is because ay sick with some disease is because ay Asma has drifted Asma has drifted through and so hypocrates developed a through and so hypocrates developed a very uh elaborate way to explain a lot very uh elaborate way to explain a lot of diseases that there were miasmas for of diseases that there were miasmas for people there are miasmas for other people there are miasmas for other species he said when the air is full of species he said when the air is full of miasmas whose properties are high miasmas whose properties are high hostile to human nature this is when men hostile to human nature this is when men are ill but when the air is not suitable are ill but when the air is not suitable for another type of living beings these for another type of living beings these beings are then ill um and this was a beings are then ill um and this was a really potent idea this was a very really potent idea this was a very powerful idea and it stuck on for a long powerful idea and it stuck on for a long time it took you know sometimes people time it took you know sometimes people would use you know different names for would use you know different names for the what was happening to the air but the what was happening to the air but fundamentally it was about the air fundamentally it was about the air becoming corrupt becoming pestilential becoming corrupt becoming pestilential uh and then you in a disease like uh and then you in a disease like malaria it's just it's in the name bad malaria it's just it's in the name bad air and you can see it in this picture air and you can see it in this picture from uh from uh from uh 1831 colera came to Europe uh it had not 1831 colera came to Europe uh it had not come to Europe before the 1800s and come to Europe before the 1800s and people were just shocked and overwhelmed people were just shocked and overwhelmed by the deadliness of this thing and um by the deadliness of this thing and um and they were convinced that like so and they were convinced that like so many other diseases it must be caused by many other diseases it must be caused by uh foul air corrupt air you know maybe uh foul air corrupt air you know maybe maybe that there was you know waste was maybe that there was you know waste was left on on on the ground and then so you left on on on the ground and then so you would have these miasmas form and they would have these miasmas form and they would just blow along and if the you would just blow along and if the you know the air might be very hot or some know the air might be very hot or some other sort of meteorological conditions other sort of meteorological conditions that could then help to make these that could then help to make these epidemics even epidemics even epidemics even worse worse worse um now you know one thing to bear in um now you know one thing to bear in mind is by mind is by 1831 um people had already known about 1831 um people had already known about microorganisms about microbes for about microorganisms about microbes for about 150 years and even in the early 1700s 150 years and even in the early 1700s there were people who were saying um you there were people who were saying um you know we think that these microbes are know we think that these microbes are causing these diseases like the plague I causing these diseases like the plague I mean people were making that connection mean people were making that connection already but they didn't have any they already but they didn't have any they didn't really have have compelling proof didn't really have have compelling proof and so it was easy for a lot of people and so it was easy for a lot of people to just dismiss that and continue to to just dismiss that and continue to think about my asthmas um in then in the think about my asthmas um in then in the 19th century 19th century 19th century um those microbes started to get more um those microbes started to get more respect um one person who was really respect um one person who was really important for that was a German uh important for that was a German uh scientist named uh godfried aronburg um scientist named uh godfried aronburg um he went on all sorts of amazing Journeys he went on all sorts of amazing Journeys in Africa and Siberia all over the place in Africa and Siberia all over the place and he studied all kinds of life and he studied all kinds of life forms but what really uh but what really forms but what really uh but what really captiv captivated him the most captiv captivated him the most were were were microorganisms and so this is just a microorganisms and so this is just a sketch of a from one sketch of countless sketch of a from one sketch of countless that that he would make aronburg is is that that he would make aronburg is is the person who coined the word bacteria the person who coined the word bacteria you know he was he he brought order to you know he was he he brought order to this whole hidden Universe of of this whole hidden Universe of of microbes microbes microbes um and you know he he was he did all um and you know he he was he did all sorts of sorts of sorts of research that led him to to get the research that led him to to get the conviction that there was actually not conviction that there was actually not just uh bacteria and other microbes in just uh bacteria and other microbes in the ocean and in the soil and so on but the ocean and in the soil and so on but also in the also in the air um for example Charles Darwin air um for example Charles Darwin actually gave him some samples of dust actually gave him some samples of dust that he had collected on the his ship that he had collected on the his ship the beagle in the middle of the Atlantic the beagle in the middle of the Atlantic and when uh aronberg looked at it he and when uh aronberg looked at it he found that they it was actually uh full found that they it was actually uh full of microorganisms I mean Darwin himself of microorganisms I mean Darwin himself was just astonished by was just astonished by this um and this um and so but the thing was that so but the thing was that um you know aronburg had found you know um you know aronburg had found you know argued that there was this thing that argued that there was this thing that some people called an atmospheric some people called an atmospheric Kingdom of life so of this invisible Kingdom of life so of this invisible world in the air around us but he you world in the air around us but he you know he still again like he didn't have know he still again like he didn't have like direct evidence like direct evidence um and really the the person who really um and really the the person who really started to to find some of the crucial started to to find some of the crucial evidence was none other than Louie evidence was none other than Louie Pastor Louis Pastor was engaged in a Pastor Louis Pastor was engaged in a debate in the 1850s about whether life debate in the 1850s about whether life could spontaneously generate or whether could spontaneously generate or whether uh you know every microbe that you found uh you know every microbe that you found descended from another descended from another microbe and he argued that spontaneous microbe and he argued that spontaneous generation was an illusion and that generation was an illusion and that actually there were things floating actually there were things floating through the air and they would settle in through the air and they would settle in place place place and so suddenly they would seem to sort and so suddenly they would seem to sort of magically appear in you know a a a of magically appear in you know a a a vat of grape juice say that you were vat of grape juice say that you were fermenting into wine uh and he actually fermenting into wine uh and he actually went to a glacier with flasks if you can went to a glacier with flasks if you can believe it and he would wave them around believe it and he would wave them around in the in the in the air and and hope that you know bacteria air and and hope that you know bacteria would land in the sterile broth in the would land in the sterile broth in the flask and they did he could actually flask and they did he could actually show like I incubating bacteria that I show like I incubating bacteria that I found on top of a glacier um this was found on top of a glacier um this was very difficult for people to believe um very difficult for people to believe um there was a journalist at the time who there was a journalist at the time who said to pastor this is you want to lead said to pastor this is you want to lead us into a world that is too Fantastical us into a world that is too Fantastical to believe so the the idea that there to believe so the the idea that there were you know bacteria floating around were you know bacteria floating around us and other things was just uh just too us and other things was just uh just too much um much um much um now Pastor was also really important for now Pastor was also really important for for championing the The Germ theory of for championing the The Germ theory of disease and so instead of my asthmas disease and so instead of my asthmas being the cause of things like chalera being the cause of things like chalera people started to to pin down diseases people started to to pin down diseases to specific microbes so in the case of to specific microbes so in the case of chalera was chalera was chalera was bacteria that was uh that Robert Coke bacteria that was uh that Robert Coke referred to as he called it a Comm referred to as he called it a Comm bacillus we call it vibrio colide today bacillus we call it vibrio colide today um and in uh 1892 in an outbreak in um and in uh 1892 in an outbreak in Hamburg you know Coke Hamburg you know Coke uh dealt with that for the first time in uh dealt with that for the first time in a in a modern Way by saying we are going a in a modern Way by saying we are going to deal with the bacteria in this water to deal with the bacteria in this water we are going to bring people clean water we are going to bring people clean water we're going to clean out these we're going to clean out these contaminated homes and we're going to contaminated homes and we're going to stop this outbreak uh and he did and stop this outbreak uh and he did and this actually then became the the this actually then became the the standard in Germany for how to deal with standard in Germany for how to deal with public public public health and actually right here in health and actually right here in Massachusetts at the same year something Massachusetts at the same year something very similar happened um very similar happened um William Sedwick was a microbiologist and William Sedwick was a microbiologist and um he uh he was brought in to LEL to um he uh he was brought in to LEL to deal with a an outbreak of typhoid so we deal with a an outbreak of typhoid so we know typhoid now is being caused by know typhoid now is being caused by bacteria but at the time literally like bacteria but at the time literally like in 1892 people in low are like yeah I in 1892 people in low are like yeah I know it was a really cold winter and you know it was a really cold winter and you know the air is just kind of strange know the air is just kind of strange like people were still blaming the air like people were still blaming the air and he said no this is bacteria the the and he said no this is bacteria the the cause of tyho had already been cause of tyho had already been identified if IED a couple years earlier identified if IED a couple years earlier by coch and others and so he actually by coch and others and so he actually demonstrated where in the river the demonstrated where in the river the sewage was coming in and making people sewage was coming in and making people sick and he said hey how about you not sick and he said hey how about you not get your drinking water from the same get your drinking water from the same river where you're dumping your sewage river where you're dumping your sewage what a what a what a concept so L said yeah okay so they sank concept so L said yeah okay so they sank a bunch of wells and uh they didn't have a bunch of wells and uh they didn't have to deal with tyo anymore um this was you to deal with tyo anymore um this was you know this was a public health Revolution know this was a public health Revolution and sedc was was was leading the and sedc was was was leading the revolution he came to MIT and he set up revolution he came to MIT and he set up one of the first modern public health one of the first modern public health programs um and he would at his lectures programs um and he would at his lectures he would he would wave a flask of water he would he would wave a flask of water with uh you know the bacteria that with uh you know the bacteria that causes typhoid and he'd say like I can causes typhoid and he'd say like I can kill a thousand people with this but you kill a thousand people with this but you people you my students are going to go people you my students are going to go out and you are going to save people's out and you are going to save people's lives because we're going to make sure lives because we're going to make sure that people don't get typhoid because that people don't get typhoid because now we know where typhoid is now we know where typhoid is from and again and again these diseases from and again and again these diseases were being linked to microbes that were were being linked to microbes that were spread in water or in food in sex in spread in water or in food in sex in contact not the contact not the air so the air started to become air so the air started to become harmless it seemed uh Sedrick actually harmless it seemed uh Sedrick actually uh with where the student ran an uh with where the student ran an experiment here at Boston City Hospital experiment here at Boston City Hospital where they actually created this device where they actually created this device called an aerob bioscope where they it called an aerob bioscope where they it was a vacuum sealed cylinder and they was a vacuum sealed cylinder and they would pop it open and it would air would would pop it open and it would air would rush in and again they had some rush in and again they had some cylinders and they would just see what cylinders and they would just see what they could catch and they just didn't they could catch and they just didn't really it didn't seem like there was really it didn't seem like there was very much inside the hospital so they very much inside the hospital so they were like yeah it's not a big deal we're were like yeah it's not a big deal we're not worried about the air not worried about the air um and Cedric would send his students at um and Cedric would send his students at MIT uh down to Providence Rhode Island MIT uh down to Providence Rhode Island where the person in charge of public where the person in charge of public health there Charles chapen would talk health there Charles chapen would talk to them about public health um and to them about public health um and chapen became really the the the leader chapen became really the the the leader of American public health in the early of American public health in the early 1900s and he was adamant that that you 1900s and he was adamant that that you know the the air that people exhaled you know the the air that people exhaled you did not have to worry about that in any did not have to worry about that in any significant way for all sorts of significant way for all sorts of diseases you didn't have to worry and he diseases you didn't have to worry and he said it will be a great relief to most said it will be a great relief to most people to be freed from the Spectre of people to be freed from the Spectre of infected air this Superstition these old infected air this Superstition these old Notions of mymas a spectre which has Notions of mymas a spectre which has pursued the race from the times of pursued the race from the times of hypocrates here we are in the modern hypocrates here we are in the modern world the air is world the air is fine fine fine so you know the people knew that there so you know the people knew that there were things in the air though so for were things in the air though so for example um you know Farmers knew that example um you know Farmers knew that their their crops could get wiped out by their their crops could get wiped out by spores of spores of spores of fungi uh and one example was uh fungi uh and one example was uh something called wheat rust uh which something called wheat rust uh which could knock out you know huge Fields uh could knock out you know huge Fields uh very quickly um but some they was it was very quickly um but some they was it was in a different discipline people really in a different discipline people really didn't think about that very much and so didn't think about that very much and so really this Paradigm just took hold and really this Paradigm just took hold and it was in place when William Wells came it was in place when William Wells came to MIT in 1910 and he studied under to MIT in 1910 and he studied under cedrick um and he he said of cedrick cedrick um and he he said of cedrick later this is what well said he strove later this is what well said he strove to inspire us for the coming battles to inspire us for the coming battles which lay ahead so this is where how which lay ahead so this is where how Wells thought of himself I I'm a soldier Wells thought of himself I I'm a soldier for public for public for public health he probably sat at the knee of health he probably sat at the knee of Charles chapen and evidence because Charles chapen and evidence because that's what you did when you were a that's what you did when you were a student of student of student of cedrix and so he goes off and he he cedrix and so he goes off and he he starts to to specialize in dealing with starts to to specialize in dealing with diseases like typhoid in the water he diseases like typhoid in the water he comes up with tests to figure out if comes up with tests to figure out if water is contaminated and he starts to water is contaminated and he starts to specialize uh after he leaves MIT in specialize uh after he leaves MIT in oysters so oysters are incredibly oysters so oysters are incredibly popular but you know those oysters are popular but you know those oysters are sitting in the water and they're sitting in the water and they're filtering water all the time and so it filtering water all the time and so it was quite common for people to be was quite common for people to be enjoying some oysters and just kill over enjoying some oysters and just kill over from typhoid people were dying from from typhoid people were dying from contaminated oysters a contaminated oysters a lot and so he was starting to study well lot and so he was starting to study well how how does it happen how did the how how does it happen how did the bacteria go from the water into these bacteria go from the water into these oysters and then you know get trapped oysters and then you know get trapped and can you purify them what what can and can you purify them what what can you do so he's happily going about this you do so he's happily going about this until World War I until World War I came and um he actually went to uh uh he came and um he actually went to uh uh he actually uh went to um Camp me in actually uh went to um Camp me in Maryland um and he gave them clean Maryland um and he gave them clean water um there was just a little dirty water um there was just a little dirty stream there and he had this a truck stream there and he had this a truck that would purify water for them um and that would purify water for them um and after he figured out how to do that he after he figured out how to do that he then went to France and was bringing then went to France and was bringing clean water to soldiers fighting at the clean water to soldiers fighting at the front so there he was saving lots of front so there he was saving lots of lives living the dream he was the lives living the dream he was the soldier saving people's lives with the soldier saving people's lives with the germ theory of disease uh germ theory of disease uh Unfortunately they all started dying of Unfortunately they all started dying of something else of influenza this was not something else of influenza this was not a waterborne disease in fact uh you know a waterborne disease in fact uh you know Wells probably kind of got the idea that Wells probably kind of got the idea that this was something that was spreading by this was something that was spreading by air nobody knew it was a virus at this air nobody knew it was a virus at this point but PE soldiers were dying in point but PE soldiers were dying in droves H just colossal numbers you know droves H just colossal numbers you know more people were ending soldiers end up more people were ending soldiers end up ending up in the hospital in World War I ending up in the hospital in World War I with the flu then were getting wounded with the flu then were getting wounded on the on the on the battlefield uh and then from from the battlefield uh and then from from the ranks of American soldiers influenza ranks of American soldiers influenza then spread across the world um and so then spread across the world um and so civilians had to deal with it so while civilians had to deal with it so while William Wells was uh in France during William Wells was uh in France during World War I uh his sister back in the World War I uh his sister back in the United States dies at age 27 one among United States dies at age 27 one among many many people who died 50 100 million many many people who died 50 100 million people probably died of the pandemic in people probably died of the pandemic in 1918 um this would haunt Wells uh for 1918 um this would haunt Wells uh for years he would later talk about the years he would later talk about the failure of Public Health to deliver failure of Public Health to deliver Mankind from the 1918 pandemic of Mankind from the 1918 pandemic of influenza and I and I think that my influenza and I and I think that my hunch is that this was like a in the hunch is that this was like a in the back of his head for things that he he back of his head for things that he he would do later would do later on he comes back um he's he's married on he comes back um he's he's married now to a woman named Mildred Wells um now to a woman named Mildred Wells um doctor from Texas and I'm going to get doctor from Texas and I'm going to get back to her in a little bit uh they have back to her in a little bit uh they have a son named William Jr um who probably a son named William Jr um who probably very early on exhibited some kind of very early on exhibited some kind of psychiatric condition maybe psychiatric condition maybe schizophrenia uh and stayed at schizophrenia uh and stayed at home so in the 1920s Wells goes back to home so in the 1920s Wells goes back to uh oysters you know it's so Roaring 20s uh oysters you know it's so Roaring 20s everybody's enjoying their oysters and everybody's enjoying their oysters and people are still dying in incredible people are still dying in incredible numbers of typhoid from oysters like numbers of typhoid from oysters like like you'd think that people might stop like you'd think that people might stop but no they love their oysters and so but no they love their oysters and so what wells wanted to do uh this is like what wells wanted to do uh this is like you know a story of an outbreak you know you know a story of an outbreak you know the sad story of a social Downfall with the sad story of a social Downfall with a grim reaper next to the oyster um so a grim reaper next to the oyster um so Wells is just trying to figure out how Wells is just trying to figure out how can I make these oysters can I make these oysters safe so he's actually starts to raise safe so he's actually starts to raise oysters to study them and he's and he's oysters to study them and he's and he's raising them in water the larae the raising them in water the larae the little larvae and the water gets kind of little larvae and the water gets kind of old he wants to move the larvae into old he wants to move the larvae into fresh fresh water so how do I get the fresh fresh water so how do I get the larae out it gets this idea a cream larae out it gets this idea a cream separator which uses in tripal force to separator which uses in tripal force to to separate the cream from the milk so to separate the cream from the milk so we'll get back to the cream separated in we'll get back to the cream separated in a bit so so he starts using this to a bit so so he starts using this to separate the oysters the little larae separate the oysters the little larae from their water and then put them in from their water and then put them in fresh fresh fresh water it works it's great he starts a water it works it's great he starts a Hatchery on Long Island so this is an Hatchery on Long Island so this is an article from The New York Times where article from The New York Times where you know he is saving this the industry you know he is saving this the industry so here he starts to be called the so here he starts to be called the oyster Godfather here he is looking at a oyster Godfather here he is looking at a whole pile of oysters that that he had whole pile of oysters that that he had seeded out in Long Island off the coast seeded out in Long Island off the coast of Long Island um it's amazing stuff and of Long Island um it's amazing stuff and um and everything's great um until of um and everything's great um until of course the Great Depression comes and course the Great Depression comes and then he's out of a then he's out of a job now this is where we uh come back to job now this is where we uh come back to uh his wife uh his wife Mildred so seems like right around the Mildred so seems like right around the point that William Wells loses his job point that William Wells loses his job Mildred who's trained as a physician but Mildred who's trained as a physician but doesn't seem to have practiced medicine doesn't seem to have practiced medicine gets a job of her own she starts she is gets a job of her own she starts she is she is assigned to to study the she is assigned to to study the epidemiology of polio polio is a epidemiology of polio polio is a terrifying disease at the time nobody terrifying disease at the time nobody knows quite what causes it nobody knows knows quite what causes it nobody knows quite how it spreads and so she quite how it spreads and so she starts basically be becoming an starts basically be becoming an epidemiologist um on her own epidemiologist um on her own um and she gets convinced looking at all um and she gets convinced looking at all the evidence and coming up with all the evidence and coming up with all these charts that she creates um that it these charts that she creates um that it maybe it spreads to the maybe it spreads to the air uh she she puts this out in in in air uh she she puts this out in in in her review it's in a book uh with a her review it's in a book uh with a number of chapters on all on polio it's number of chapters on all on polio it's a very comprehensive book but um all the a very comprehensive book but um all the authors are authors are authors are women and so the New England Journal of women and so the New England Journal of Medicine uh gives them this this lovely Medicine uh gives them this this lovely uh backhanded compliment they say no one uh backhanded compliment they say no one is better fitted than a woman to collect is better fitted than a woman to collect data such as this book data such as this book contains um they they did not really contains um they they did not really take much notice at all that mild was take much notice at all that mild was thinking whether polio might be spread thinking whether polio might be spread by droplets in the air they just totally by droplets in the air they just totally passed them by but William Wells noticed passed them by but William Wells noticed William Wells then gets a job at Harvard William Wells then gets a job at Harvard U it doesn't pay very much uh and he's U it doesn't pay very much uh and he's he's kind of terrible as I said at he's kind of terrible as I said at teaching um but teaching um but um but and one of the reasons he's um but and one of the reasons he's terrible at teaching well two reasons he terrible at teaching well two reasons he just he's a bad Communicator people just he's a bad Communicator people would talk about how he would start would talk about how he would start talking and then hours would go by he talking and then hours would go by he would just you could not get a word in would just you could not get a word in edgewise that's the kind of person he edgewise that's the kind of person he was you you know people like this um and was you you know people like this um and also he was really not interested in also he was really not interested in teaching he wanted to be like Sedwick teaching he wanted to be like Sedwick his mentor he and you know sedok had his mentor he and you know sedok had helped found Harvard School of Public helped found Harvard School of Public Health and he's like now here I am you Health and he's like now here I am you know I'm at the show like what am I know I'm at the show like what am I going to do and Incredibly like in an going to do and Incredibly like in an office that he was given there was a office that he was given there was a picture of this aerob bioscope and he's picture of this aerob bioscope and he's looking at it he's like huh now remember looking at it he's like huh now remember s Wells is a is a is a good engineer a s Wells is a is a is a good engineer a good inventor he understands physics good inventor he understands physics like like this is really you know a lot like like this is really you know a lot of his background of his background and he's like that's not a very good way and he's like that's not a very good way to sample things from the air because to sample things from the air because you're just taking one little sample you're just taking one little sample very quickly we are breathing in and out very quickly we are breathing in and out we are breathing a couple thousand times we are breathing a couple thousand times a a a day we are like day we are like oysters so he's like how can I get more oysters so he's like how can I get more air through a machine and he's like air through a machine and he's like that's centrifuge the centrifuge that that's centrifuge the centrifuge that originally was used to make cream that originally was used to make cream that he used to separate he used to separate oysters I'm going to use it to oysters I'm going to use it to centrifuge air so that's how this thing centrifuge air so that's how this thing came about he invented the air came about he invented the air centrifuge probably around centrifuge probably around 193 one or 193 one or so so he invents this thing and he he so so he invents this thing and he he starts to do experiments on his students starts to do experiments on his students you know with steezing powder um he um you know with steezing powder um he um he takes it around Boston with with the he takes it around Boston with with the the Riley Brothers and they they start the Riley Brothers and they they start trying things out and in they find trying things out and in they find generally indoors they can get a lot of generally indoors they can get a lot of of of the kind a lot of bacteria of the of of the kind a lot of bacteria of the kind that are associated with humans kind that are associated with humans Outdoors not very Outdoors not very much so you know this is the kind of much so you know this is the kind of space where you know you will find these space where you know you will find these kinds of things in the basement of one of these things in the basement of one of these buildings at Harvard School of Public buildings at Harvard School of Public Health was a giant tank that was left Health was a giant tank that was left over from World War I when they were over from World War I when they were trying to uh study chemical trying to uh study chemical warfare they were studying the G you warfare they were studying the G you know these gases so they could design know these gases so they could design gas masks for soldiers on the front and gas masks for soldiers on the front and it was just sitting there so like you it was just sitting there so like you know 15 years later Wells is like okay know 15 years later Wells is like okay I'm going to use this I'm going to I'm going to use this I'm going to spray droplets into this thing and I'm spray droplets into this thing and I'm going to study it I'm going to shine going to study it I'm going to shine lights in there I'm going to have my lights in there I'm going to have my centrifuge pulling things out in the air centrifuge pulling things out in the air and he does a bunch of experiments and and he does a bunch of experiments and Riley helps him to understand that ah Riley helps him to understand that ah you know these these droplets are you know these these droplets are floating in the air they're able to stay floating in the air they're able to stay around for a long time long enough that around for a long time long enough that they can we can inhale them and so it's they can we can inhale them and so it's it's it's a possibility that diseases it's it's a possibility that diseases can spread from person to person so now can spread from person to person so now he's got a theory based on physics about he's got a theory based on physics about Airborne Airborne Airborne infection and so you know he is totally infection and so you know he is totally going against chapen he's saying this is going against chapen he's saying this is a this is a a this is a this is a concern um the wells for a little concern um the wells for a little while uh This research while uh This research was a sensation other scientists were was a sensation other scientists were very excited by it there were scientists very excited by it there were scientists at Columbia University who took these uh at Columbia University who took these uh air Wells air centrifuges onto the New air Wells air centrifuges onto the New York City subway and discovered lots of York City subway and discovered lots of bacteria on the subway much more than if bacteria on the subway much more than if they went into Central they went into Central Park Park Park now I'm going to show you this picture now I'm going to show you this picture again uh this picture that thing glowing again uh this picture that thing glowing there that's an UltraViolet lamp Wells there that's an UltraViolet lamp Wells was saying okay now that I'm figuring was saying okay now that I'm figuring out that maybe diseases can be spread out that maybe diseases can be spread through the air how can I how can I through the air how can I clean the air in the same way that clean the air in the same way that Sedrick cleaned water what can I do what Sedrick cleaned water what can I do what can I use and he starts experimenting can I use and he starts experimenting with things and he discovers ultraviolet with things and he discovers ultraviolet light works really well to disinfect air light works really well to disinfect air so if he if he had influen of viruses so if he if he had influen of viruses floating along he could knock them out floating along he could knock them out with UV with UV with UV light um light um light um and so he he publishes a paper about and so he he publishes a paper about this in this in this in 1936 and it is huge people you know 1936 and it is huge people you know people are saying we are going to have people are saying we are going to have ultraviolet light everywhere we are ultraviolet light everywhere we are going to be protected from diseases like going to be protected from diseases like influenza thanks to the work of William influenza thanks to the work of William Wells uh this was this was a sensation Wells uh this was this was a sensation Hospital started installing UV lights uh Hospital started installing UV lights uh to protect patients um this is a train to protect patients um this is a train uh in Maine where they installed uh in Maine where they installed ultraviolet lights in there so that ultraviolet lights in there so that people on the train wouldn't give each people on the train wouldn't give each other diseases um this became a other diseases um this became a thing uh but it did not actually bring thing uh but it did not actually bring Wells you know real glory or security Wells you know real glory or security either um either um either um because um as far as I can tell he did because um as far as I can tell he did not get along he and Mild did not get not get along he and Mild did not get along with their boss their boss was along with their boss their boss was Gordon fair was very prominent um Gordon fair was very prominent um engineer and and a public health expert engineer and and a public health expert at Harvard and they did not get along as at Harvard and they did not get along as soon as Fair basically Wells borrowed soon as Fair basically Wells borrowed ult Fair's UV lamps to do his research ult Fair's UV lamps to do his research fair was like that's not going to work fair was like that's not going to work and then it did work and then fa wanted and then it did work and then fa wanted to be in on the patent he wanted to be a to be in on the patent he wanted to be a co-author on the paper and he said you co-author on the paper and he said you all this work is going to happen to my all this work is going to happen to my lab from now on and the wells got into a lab from now on and the wells got into a huge fight with them and because of they huge fight with them and because of they were the wells they had no friends and were the wells they had no friends and so they were out so Harvard fired them so they were out so Harvard fired them um and uh you know their reputation um and uh you know their reputation unfortunately preceded them and it unfortunately preceded them and it didn't look very good for them to get didn't look very good for them to get hired anywhere but there was a doctor in hired anywhere but there was a doctor in Philadelphia who was using UV lights in Philadelphia who was using UV lights in his in his hospital and he and he his in his hospital and he and he basically basically basically engineered bringing them to the engineered bringing them to the University of University of University of Pennsylvania and they opened up this Pennsylvania and they opened up this thing called the laboratory for the thing called the laboratory for the study of Airborne infection and and it study of Airborne infection and and it was housed in this uh building this was was housed in this uh building this was a big building for the study of a big building for the study of tuberculosis and so they had a couple tuberculosis and so they had a couple rooms in rooms in rooms in there and so Wells got to work he there and so Wells got to work he started to build new devices um and this started to build new devices um and this thing here uh came to be known as the thing here uh came to be known as the infection infection infection machine um what you would do is you machine um what you would do is you would put an animal or some animals and would put an animal or some animals and a little like there's little cage of a little like there's little cage of mice in there um and they would breathe mice in there um and they would breathe air and then you would actually deliver air and then you would actually deliver air to them they would have be have air to them they would have be have droplets and those droplets might have droplets and those droplets might have influenza viruses in them or influenza viruses in them or tuberculosis bacteria or other pathogens tuberculosis bacteria or other pathogens you could see the Well's air centrifuge you could see the Well's air centrifuge in the corner there that was used to in the corner there that was used to sort of sample to figure out how you sort of sample to figure out how you know what level of of these viruses or know what level of of these viruses or bacteria were were in the air so this is bacteria were were in the air so this is just a diagram showing you how it works just a diagram showing you how it works the the key thing is here that um is the the key thing is here that um is that he was really able to show very that he was really able to show very precisely that you you know if you if precisely that you you know if you if mice and then later rabbits were mice and then later rabbits were breathing in things like influenza breathing in things like influenza viruses or tuberculos the bacteria that viruses or tuberculos the bacteria that caused tuberculosis they would get sick caused tuberculosis they would get sick they would die if there was more of they would die if there was more of these pathogens in the these pathogens in the air this it was more severe he could air this it was more severe he could control it very precisely he could make control it very precisely he could make predictions about just how much you predictions about just how much you needed to breathe in to get sick needed to breathe in to get sick and if we put a UV lamp on that pipe on and if we put a UV lamp on that pipe on the tube that delivered those the tube that delivered those droplets the animals were droplets the animals were fine um now meanwhile uh Mildred is busy fine um now meanwhile uh Mildred is busy in a in a couple schools in Philadelphia in a in a couple schools in Philadelphia because William and Mildred installed UV because William and Mildred installed UV lamps like that in the lamps like that in the school and so you know so the lights are school and so you know so the lights are pointing up so these kids are not going pointing up so these kids are not going blind don't worry um but the idea was blind don't worry um but the idea was that you know if you've got these kids that you know if you've got these kids who are uh you know just just yelling who are uh you know just just yelling and running around and having fun you and running around and having fun you know they're they're they're exhaling know they're they're they're exhaling lots of of stuff lots of germs um and lots of of stuff lots of germs um and this UV these UV lamps can protect them this UV these UV lamps can protect them and it turned out they did there was a and it turned out they did there was a measles outbreak familiar measles yeah measles outbreak familiar measles yeah speaking of which um there was a measles speaking of which um there was a measles outbreak in 1940 so this was a at a time outbreak in 1940 so this was a at a time when there was no vaccine for measles so when there was no vaccine for measles so um you know unlike today um measles were um you know unlike today um measles were uh a really terrible fact of life uh a really terrible fact of life measles hit Philadelphia in 1940 was the measles hit Philadelphia in 1940 was the biggest epidemic of measles they had biggest epidemic of measles they had seen in years this school was protected seen in years this school was protected they had very little measles there and they had very little measles there and you could credit the UV lamps for that you could credit the UV lamps for that and Mildred painstakingly recorded you and Mildred painstakingly recorded you know all that data of these children know all that data of these children and their medical data to show that and their medical data to show that these were these were these were working so you know so in the 1940s you working so you know so in the 1940s you might think like okay all right all might think like okay all right all right they had some trouble at Harvard right they had some trouble at Harvard now they're at Penn things are going now they're at Penn things are going great like you know this now they're great like you know this now they're going to really things are going to go going to really things are going to go really great for them and unfortunately really great for them and unfortunately it didn't um what part of what happened it didn't um what part of what happened was World War II so suddenly like was World War II so suddenly like everybody had to focus on the war and so everybody had to focus on the war and so all sorts of you know infectious disease all sorts of you know infectious disease experts were trying to figure out how do experts were trying to figure out how do we keep our soldiers from getting sick we keep our soldiers from getting sick and the wells wanted to help they were and the wells wanted to help they were terrified that there was going to be terrified that there was going to be another 1918 flu another 1918 flu pandemic so they wanted in they wanted pandemic so they wanted in they wanted to run a big experiment like the one at to run a big experiment like the one at that school but in army barracks with that school but in army barracks with thousands of soldiers they said like thousands of soldiers they said like this will convince everybody that this will convince everybody that Airborne infection is real but they Airborne infection is real but they couldn't even get in to that research so couldn't even get in to that research so instead people looked at other things instead people looked at other things they ran other experiments the wellses they ran other experiments the wellses were shut were shut were shut out um and they were really quite out um and they were really quite embittered um you know and and you could embittered um you know and and you could they could sense that their their they could sense that their their colleagues were really shifting away colleagues were really shifting away from the idea of Airborne from the idea of Airborne infection weirdly I won't get into this infection weirdly I won't get into this too much but um I talk about this in the too much but um I talk about this in the book book book uh there were some people in World War uh there were some people in World War II who were really really interested in II who were really really interested in wells's work and were actually in a way wells's work and were actually in a way confirming all his work these were the confirming all his work these were the people who were building biological people who were building biological weapons for the US Army so this is a weapons for the US Army so this is a camp Dietrich and this is an infection camp Dietrich and this is an infection machine it's just an it's a just a a machine it's just an it's a just a a military grade infection machine and military grade infection machine and instead of figuring out how to protect instead of figuring out how to protect Mice from dying they're figuring out how Mice from dying they're figuring out how much do we need to give the mice to kill much do we need to give the mice to kill them um this would lead to just a huge them um this would lead to just a huge ug Arsenal in the United States of ug Arsenal in the United States of Anthrax bombs and all sorts of other Anthrax bombs and all sorts of other biological weapons Wells didn't know biological weapons Wells didn't know about any of this this was all about any of this this was all classified when he found out about it classified when he found out about it after the war he was shocked and after the war he was shocked and horrified horrified horrified so the there were a couple things that so the there were a couple things that the wellses did the wellses did um to try to one basically Mildred and um to try to one basically Mildred and William they each tried one last time to William they each tried one last time to really pursue suway the world about really pursue suway the world about Airborne Airborne Airborne infection by now their marriage had infection by now their marriage had pretty much Fallen apart um they didn't pretty much Fallen apart um they didn't get divorced but they were totally get divorced but they were totally estranged mild just went off on her own estranged mild just went off on her own and did her own research um and she was and did her own research um and she was just as committed to this as William was just as committed to this as William was she uh this Quest she she wrote I she uh this Quest she she wrote I believe that a provision of pure air for believe that a provision of pure air for children and adults to breathe should be children and adults to breathe should be looked upon as of equal importance to looked upon as of equal importance to the provision of pure water and pure the provision of pure water and pure milk and so her last experiment took milk and so her last experiment took place in Pleasantville New York she place in Pleasantville New York she actually was able to convince the public actually was able to convince the public health commissioner there to basically health commissioner there to basically rig up the town the whole town with UV rig up the town the whole town with UV light so in the church uh in the train light so in the church uh in the train station in the movie theater in the you station in the movie theater in the you know the fountain shops everywhere there know the fountain shops everywhere there were UV lamps and she was really hoping were UV lamps and she was really hoping that she could get definitive proof that that she could get definitive proof that this worked there you know they there were worked there you know they there were some some some promising results that she published in promising results that she published in 1950 um but you know people looked at it 1950 um but you know people looked at it these experts looked at it and they were these experts looked at it and they were like H it it wasn't compelling enough like H it it wasn't compelling enough for them and part of the problem there for them and part of the problem there was that you know she wasn't able to put was that you know she wasn't able to put UV lights UV lights UV lights everywhere uh and people were going to everywhere uh and people were going to New York City and back as a in this New York City and back as a in this commuter town and bringing diseases with commuter town and bringing diseases with them so it wasn't a clean result and them so it wasn't a clean result and people who wanted to ignore it ignored people who wanted to ignore it ignored it and so she died um in 1957 and this it and so she died um in 1957 and this is this is the only obituary this was is this is the only obituary this was the only notice that was taken of her it the only notice that was taken of her it was a local Delaware uh was a local Delaware uh obituary that's it and this is the only obituary that's it and this is the only picture I've ever found of her from her picture I've ever found of her from her yearbook so milg dies and William is yearbook so milg dies and William is Alone um it's a it's very hard for him Alone um it's a it's very hard for him know now she's totally gone but he is know now she's totally gone but he is now going to make one last take one last now going to make one last take one last shot at this he's in his shot at this he's in his 60s pen University of Pennsylvania has 60s pen University of Pennsylvania has now fired him like they they can't deal now fired him like they they can't deal with him with him with him either and so he's going to try to prove either and so he's going to try to prove that uh he's going to try to like that uh he's going to try to like establish that establish that establish that tuberculosis is Con is air can be spread tuberculosis is Con is air can be spread through the air and then you can stop it through the air and then you can stop it in the air so tuberculosis uh you know in the air so tuberculosis uh you know is this huge burden uh on people um even is this huge burden uh on people um even to it kills over a million people a year to it kills over a million people a year um and you know poor people died of it um and you know poor people died of it wealthy people died of it this is Claude wealthy people died of it this is Claude man's wife before uh she got TB and then man's wife before uh she got TB and then he painted her you know on her deathbed he painted her you know on her deathbed it was horrific for so many it was horrific for so many people um there there was an idea for a people um there there was an idea for a while that it was hereditary because a while that it was hereditary because a very slow developing disease um then very slow developing disease um then people in the when the germ theory of people in the when the germ theory of disease came along uh a lot of people disease came along uh a lot of people believed that uh people would spit you believed that uh people would spit you know they cough and they'd spit on the know they cough and they'd spit on the ground and then the the that spit would ground and then the the that spit would kind of turn into dust and if you you kind of turn into dust and if you you know disturb the dust then maybe you know disturb the dust then maybe you might inhale it um and so that was why a might inhale it um and so that was why a lot of spitting rules came into lot of spitting rules came into existence actually um Wells was existence actually um Wells was convinced no this is not the case you convinced no this is not the case you just if you have tuberculosis and you just if you have tuberculosis and you just breathe or talk you're going to just breathe or talk you're going to excel exhale these droplet excel exhale these droplet nuclei um and none other than Richard nuclei um and none other than Richard Riley came back to help him out on this Riley came back to help him out on this um Riley had been in touch with wells um Riley had been in touch with wells for years we in the 1950s now and now for years we in the 1950s now and now Riley's at John's Hopkins and he finds Riley's at John's Hopkins and he finds out about a VA Hospital not far from out about a VA Hospital not far from them called lock Raven so they are able so this is after Raven so they are able so this is after years of Wells just trying to get this years of Wells just trying to get this experiment off the ground finally it's experiment off the ground finally it's going to happen in uh like 1957 or so um going to happen in uh like 1957 or so um so they take over actually some rooms so they take over actually some rooms that were used to be a ward for people that were used to be a ward for people with psychiatric with psychiatric with psychiatric conditions they just they put people conditions they just they put people with tuberculosis in there um and they with tuberculosis in there um and they sort of seal off these rooms so that the sort of seal off these rooms so that the the people who are in there breathing the people who are in there breathing their air is in the rooms and the only their air is in the rooms and the only way it gets out is through a ventilation way it gets out is through a ventilation system and the ventilation system goes system and the ventilation system goes up to a penthouse above where there they up to a penthouse above where there they have a whole little city of guinea pigs have a whole little city of guinea pigs and the guinea pigs breathe in the and the guinea pigs breathe in the air and it works the guinea pigs are air and it works the guinea pigs are getting getting getting tuberculosis now while this is happening tuberculosis now while this is happening Wells uh collapses at his home he has Wells uh collapses at his home he has cancer he's also gone psychotic uh and cancer he's also gone psychotic uh and he has to be rushed to a he has to be rushed to a hospital he's a veteran they take him to hospital he's a veteran they take him to the nearest hospital it's this the nearest hospital it's this hospital so he is lying in bed dying for hospital so he is lying in bed dying for a couple years and also going in and out a couple years and also going in and out of psychotic episodes while this of psychotic episodes while this experiment that is demonstrating that he experiment that is demonstrating that he was right takes place overhead is was right takes place overhead is incredible incredible incredible um and you know and and even you know um and you know and and even you know and and using ultraviolet light was able and and using ultraviolet light was able to protect the guinea pigs too I should to protect the guinea pigs too I should say so Wells dies in 1963 say so Wells dies in 1963 in that hospital bed at lock in that hospital bed at lock Raven and even then even after these Raven and even then even after these experiments the wellses just fade away experiments the wellses just fade away Into Into Into Obscurity um this is a quote from Ronald Obscurity um this is a quote from Ronald hair who actually gave a lecture about hair who actually gave a lecture about respiratory diseases like about a month respiratory diseases like about a month after Wells died and um basically he after Wells died and um basically he just says it is Extreme despite the just says it is Extreme despite the contentions of Wells it is extremely contentions of Wells it is extremely doubtful whether droplet nuclea play any doubtful whether droplet nuclea play any important part in the transmission of important part in the transmission of respiratory infection respiratory infection respiratory infection now people did eventually like say okay now people did eventually like say okay maybe yeah maybe yeah maybe yeah tuberculosis okay like it was sort of a tuberculosis okay like it was sort of a grudging acceptance by the community but grudging acceptance by the community but it really didn't go much further than it really didn't go much further than that that that um so after Wells died there were very um so after Wells died there were very few people that really like carried this few people that really like carried this on so so Richard Riley um you know he he on so so Richard Riley um you know he he kept trying to do it on his own um he kept trying to do it on his own um he once actually like put on a gas mask once actually like put on a gas mask sealed off his own office and flooded it sealed off his own office and flooded it with the bacteria that caused with the bacteria that caused tuberculosis and then switched on an tuberculosis and then switched on an UltraViolet lamp and just was able to UltraViolet lamp and just was able to demonstrate he was could keep his office demonstrate he was could keep his office clean I I wonder what the people in the clean I I wonder what the people in the office next to him wondered if they office next to him wondered if they looked over and saw a guy with a gas looked over and saw a guy with a gas mask inside his own office he would do mask inside his own office he would do anything for science um but he actually anything for science um but he actually did go on to to with his brother in the did go on to to with his brother in the 1970s to do a really important 1970s to do a really important experiment that really helped to nail experiment that really helped to nail down the fact that measles is Airborne down the fact that measles is Airborne that is one of the reasons why you need that is one of the reasons why you need about 95% of people to get vaccinated to about 95% of people to get vaccinated to protect the community that is why we are protect the community that is why we are now dealing with a measles outbreak in now dealing with a measles outbreak in Texas because there are communities Texas because there are communities there that are below that threshold the there that are below that threshold the measles is spreading through the air to measles is spreading through the air to between them um in uh the 1980s Richard between them um in uh the 1980s Richard Riley uh uh connected with Ed nardell Riley uh uh connected with Ed nardell who is a scientist uh tuberculosis who is a scientist uh tuberculosis expert uh uh uh here at Harvard Medical expert uh uh uh here at Harvard Medical School he's actually here tonight um and School he's actually here tonight um and uh and so so Ed did a lot of work trying uh and so so Ed did a lot of work trying to figure out can we use ultraviolet to figure out can we use ultraviolet light to protect people in homeless light to protect people in homeless shelters from tuberculosis because shelters from tuberculosis because homeless people are are are are homeless people are are are are particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis um and so there was work that was going um and so there was work that was going on on on then so so my my story from a century ago is so so my my story from a century ago is is just about over in the book I talk is just about over in the book I talk you know I I I talk a great deal about you know I I I talk a great deal about covid because it was so important in so covid because it was so important in so many many many ways for our understanding of Airborne ways for our understanding of Airborne infection infection infection um and the fact is that people like Ed um and the fact is that people like Ed Ardell and and some other people here um Ardell and and some other people here um at the time when this mysterious uh at the time when this mysterious uh disease started to emerge and China said disease started to emerge and China said folks this might be airborne we should folks this might be airborne we should treat treat it like it's treat treat it like it's airborne and maybe you were like me and airborne and maybe you were like me and you didn't I know I wiped down a lot of you didn't I know I wiped down a lot of groceries in February 2020 because I was groceries in February 2020 because I was that was my impression like oh this must that was my impression like oh this must be spread on surfaces that what Char be spread on surfaces that what Char that's what Charles chapen would have that's what Charles chapen would have told us um the Providence public health told us um the Providence public health expert and in fact you actually had the expert and in fact you actually had the World Health World Health World Health Organization um emphatically stating Organization um emphatically stating March 28th that Co is not March 28th that Co is not Airborne so you know I I uh I write in Airborne so you know I I uh I write in the book about the book about how the scientific Community shifted to how the scientific Community shifted to realize that that's not realize that that's not true you know covid is in droplets we we true you know covid is in droplets we we can we can and we can now study Airborne can we can and we can now study Airborne diseases like covid uh on a scale that diseases like covid uh on a scale that was just not possible for the wellses um was just not possible for the wellses um and it really you know while Wells you and it really you know while Wells you know Mildred and William Wells you know know Mildred and William Wells you know they they were doing very basic they they were doing very basic research you know with very research you know with very crude pieces of equipment um I'm not crude pieces of equipment um I'm not going to touch going to touch that they they still got some things that they they still got some things fundamentally right and actually it was fundamentally right and actually it was during the covid pandemic that a lot of during the covid pandemic that a lot of scientists scientists scientists themselves learn who learned about the themselves learn who learned about the wells is and for the first time wells is and for the first time so the wellses have had certainly a so the wellses have had certainly a Renaissance and and I will say that um Renaissance and and I will say that um you know when I was trying to understand you know when I was trying to understand why was everyone arguing and fighting why was everyone arguing and fighting about whether Co is Airborne and why is about whether Co is Airborne and why is this so hard you know someone said to me this so hard you know someone said to me like well you need to learn about like well you need to learn about William Wells and I said who and that's William Wells and I said who and that's part of how this book uh came to part of how this book uh came to be be be um um um so so we are so here we are now it's so so we are so here we are now it's 2025 um about 90 years after Wells ran 2025 um about 90 years after Wells ran that first experiment subjected to that first experiment subjected to students to sneezing powder and now we students to sneezing powder and now we are dealing with influenza viruses that are dealing with influenza viruses that are circulating among cows and cats and are circulating among cows and cats and other mammals um this is a bird flu it's other mammals um this is a bird flu it's primarily in Birds but it is get it is primarily in Birds but it is get it is adapting to mammals right now it seems adapting to mammals right now it seems to spread among the cows it seems to be to spread among the cows it seems to be spreading primarily from their mam their spreading primarily from their mam their udds like milking machines maybe part of udds like milking machines maybe part of how they're how they're how they're spreading sometimes they Splash and they spreading sometimes they Splash and they get into to Dairy workers's eyes they get into to Dairy workers's eyes they get get get conjunctivitis um fortunately they conjunctivitis um fortunately they haven't been getting too sick but you haven't been getting too sick but you know this is an opportunity for the bird know this is an opportunity for the bird flu to adapt to humans and so the flu to adapt to humans and so the question is like is this going to spread question is like is this going to spread between humans and how important will between humans and how important will the air be um while I was working on the the air be um while I was working on the book I actually paid a visit to uh to book I actually paid a visit to uh to Baltimore uh where Christian Coleman of Baltimore uh where Christian Coleman of the University of Maryland and her the University of Maryland and her colleague Donald Milton were trying to colleague Donald Milton were trying to trying to address this question they trying to address this question they basically like took over a floor of this basically like took over a floor of this hotel and they rigged it up with their hotel and they rigged it up with their own devices for sampling viruses uh and own devices for sampling viruses uh and they brought in you know W they would they brought in you know W they would recruit people who were sick with the recruit people who were sick with the flu and they would just sort of sit flu and they would just sort of sit around and just be sick and people would around and just be sick and people would sort of hang out with them healthy sort of hang out with them healthy volunteers you know and they they were volunteers you know and they they were hoping they could see like can we can we hoping they could see like can we can we observe transmission and can we really observe transmission and can we really nail this down um it didn't work in this nail this down um it didn't work in this particular case they were able to get particular case they were able to get the virus out of the air but people were the virus out of the air but people were not developing the flu um and you know not developing the flu um and you know part of the reason may have been because part of the reason may have been because there weren't enough people in the study there weren't enough people in the study so they want to continue the study they so they want to continue the study they plan to continue the study at the plan to continue the study at the University of Maryland on campus um it you know it took this this campus um it you know it took this this kind of work takes years to do I mean kind of work takes years to do I mean we're a long way off from the wellses we're a long way off from the wellses but this is still really hard work it but this is still really hard work it takes a lot of time and it takes takes a lot of time and it takes support uh and I'll just close by saying support uh and I'll just close by saying it's going to be a lot it's going to be a lot harder if uh there is not the kind of harder if uh there is not the kind of support that it needs going forward and support that it needs going forward and that is a serious question right now uh that is a serious question right now uh which you know uh and the sad thing is which you know uh and the sad thing is that you know the the the pathogens that you know the the the pathogens don't care they're going to move through don't care they're going to move through the air we are going to breathe them in the air we are going to breathe them in whether we understand what's happening whether we understand what's happening or not so thank you very much for for or not so thank you very much for for coming to the talk and and I'm happy to happy to answer and and I'm happy to happy to answer questions hi that was really great thank questions hi that was really great thank you it was great it was so good that I you it was great it was so good that I didn't even notice how long it didn't even notice how long it was but I you must be more like a was but I you must be more like a professor um anybody have a professor um anybody have a question you question you question you do see if this is on I don't I don't think the on I don't I don't think the microphone's working starting off by thanking Mr Zimmer that starting off by thanking Mr Zimmer that was a great talk um I'm Mackenzie I'm a was a great talk um I'm Mackenzie I'm a reporter for the Crimson um I think just reporter for the Crimson um I think just one of the questions that I have because one of the questions that I have because like you kind of briefly touched on this like you kind of briefly touched on this twice if like the type of research like twice if like the type of research like uh airborne disease like research isn't uh airborne disease like research isn't supported by the coming Administration supported by the coming Administration what do you think the recovery timeline what do you think the recovery timeline looks like for something like that in looks like for something like that in terms of after the Trump Administration terms of after the Trump Administration if research gets cut and like if research gets cut and like departments get cut like I feel like the departments get cut like I feel like the whole theme of this talk is that this whole theme of this talk is that this whole research it's very stop and go if whole research it's very stop and go if it does stop again do you think this it does stop again do you think this will recover more will recover more quickly um well you know we're we're quickly um well you know we're we're still just about a month into this so still just about a month into this so it's it is it is it is hard sometimes to it's it is it is it is hard sometimes to really look far ahead but certainly like really look far ahead but certainly like I have talked to I have talked to people people in this room who have told people people in this room who have told me about how they you know have you know me about how they you know have you know their lab has lost you know several their lab has lost you know several hundred, right now and we're hoping for hundred, right now and we're hoping for even more money in the F you know next even more money in the F you know next year and they're not sure they're going year and they're not sure they're going to be able to get that I don't know what to be able to get that I don't know what happens when suddenly uh Labs that are happens when suddenly uh Labs that are doing this kind of important research uh doing this kind of important research uh basically just have to shut basically just have to shut down because you know it's not it's not down because you know it's not it's not like you know I mean we're we're also like you know I mean we're we're also seeing that uh we're also seeing that um seeing that uh we're also seeing that um you know places like University of you know places like University of Pittsburgh and University of Pittsburgh and University of Pennsylvania have already announced that Pennsylvania have already announced that they are going to be accepting far fewer they are going to be accepting far fewer graduate students into these programs graduate students into these programs next year these are the people who do a next year these are the people who do a lot of This research so so um even lot of This research so so um even if even let's say that things were back if even let's say that things were back to quote unquote normal next year which to quote unquote normal next year which I I don't think you you would have any I I don't think you you would have any reason to expect that to be the case it reason to expect that to be the case it could take years years for the system to could take years years for the system to recover or it might not I mean I mean we recover or it might not I mean I mean we we you can look back at history at we you can look back at history at countries that systematically dismantled countries that systematically dismantled their own scientific their own scientific research you know you can look at the research you know you can look at the Soviet Union and look at their Soviet Union and look at their incredible research on genetics before incredible research on genetics before lysenko came along and then it all fell lysenko came along and then it all fell apart hi um I have a quick question about the hi um I have a quick question about the um the uh new research that came out um the uh new research that came out after covid where yes uh you know after covid where yes uh you know municipalities have the ability to test municipalities have the ability to test um water supplies or watersheds for um water supplies or watersheds for disease outbreaks and that seems to be a disease outbreaks and that seems to be a pretty quick that's a new technology um pretty quick that's a new technology um during Co that they can figure out if during Co that they can figure out if the disease is in the community with the disease is in the community with without you know having to find patients without you know having to find patients that are already clinically identified that are already clinically identified and so do you think there could be uh and so do you think there could be uh any synergistic system here between any synergistic system here between looking at you know the atmosphere is looking at you know the atmosphere is obviously a Continuum of the water obviously a Continuum of the water supply um and so I was wondering if supply um and so I was wondering if possibly since covid brought out so much possibly since covid brought out so much you know they were able to establish you know they were able to establish during the covid outbreak um and to this during the covid outbreak um and to this day about like oh this is an airborne day about like oh this is an airborne disease they were able to establish that disease they were able to establish that then they get the water treatment uh then they get the water treatment uh testing going um and another um so I'm testing going um and another um so I'm sorry what what is the question well the sorry what what is the question well the question is is do you think there will question is is do you think there will be some Synergy in the Technologies be some Synergy in the Technologies between water treatment testing to between water treatment testing to diagnose disease as well as proving diagnose disease as well as proving Airborne um transmission and is there Airborne um transmission and is there anything in the pipeline about ALS as a anything in the pipeline about ALS as a disease of CYO bacteria as aob air disease of CYO bacteria as aob air trans that's great great questions uh I trans that's great great questions uh I haven't seen anything recently about ALS haven't seen anything recently about ALS otherwise known as lugar's disease as otherwise known as lugar's disease as being possibly caused through being possibly caused through Airborne uh I think it's some kind of Cy Airborne uh I think it's some kind of Cy of bacteria I think I haven't seen of bacteria I think I haven't seen anything recently about it it's a anything recently about it it's a provocative idea but I I I I haven't provocative idea but I I I I haven't seen any important recent developments seen any important recent developments on that I might have missed something on that I might have missed something there's a lot to keep up with in these there's a lot to keep up with in these areas the thing about water with Co is areas the thing about water with Co is that um the waste water just is just a that um the waste water just is just a good indicator of the community because good indicator of the community because some people when they get covid they some people when they get covid they will uh shed the virus uh you know in will uh shed the virus uh you know in their in their stool um and it gets into their in their stool um and it gets into sewage systems and so you can you can sewage systems and so you can you can tell if if there's a lot of covid in a tell if if there's a lot of covid in a community just by looking there um that community just by looking there um that water itself is not you know that's not water itself is not you know that's not going to that's water itself is not going to that's water itself is not going to give people Co um but it's a going to give people Co um but it's a good you know if if you good it's a good you know if if you don't have good testing in a community don't have good testing in a community we don't have good testing anymore so so we don't have good testing anymore so so the Wastewater is is a good system um the Wastewater is is a good system um and that is good um there are people who and that is good um there are people who are doing well let me put it this way um are doing well let me put it this way um uh in the previous uh in the previous administration uh there was a big administration uh there was a big program that was set up to uh give program that was set up to uh give people uh grants to try to develop people uh grants to try to develop really cuttingedge devices they would be really cuttingedge devices they would be able to sample the air and tell you able to sample the air and tell you immediately what was in it in other immediately what was in it in other words to to actually sequence the DNA or words to to actually sequence the DNA or the RNA of stuff that these devices were the RNA of stuff that these devices were capturing in real time this is real capturing in real time this is real science fiction stuff um it'll be years science fiction stuff um it'll be years before this happens but there's like before this happens but there's like $150 million that was set aside for that $150 million that was set aside for that in the previous administration like in the previous administration like right now we're seeing a lot of research right now we're seeing a lot of research being clawed back uh by the current being clawed back uh by the current Administration so you know vaccines for Administration so you know vaccines for example there are research on covid example there are research on covid vaccines that's getting clawed back as vaccines that's getting clawed back as well so I can't tell you what the well so I can't tell you what the feature is going to bring on that score um hi you you spoke a lot about score um hi you you spoke a lot about the experiments with UV light and that the experiments with UV light and that they did provide some evidence for um they did provide some evidence for um diseases being Airborne um but I wonder diseases being Airborne um but I wonder if people recognize the dangers of UV if people recognize the dangers of UV light that you know causes cataracts light that you know causes cataracts maybe skin cancer um so it seems like maybe skin cancer um so it seems like there probably was a downside did any of there probably was a downside did any of that come up in your looking at the that come up in your looking at the history of those experiments yeah so I history of those experiments yeah so I should specify th those UV lamps were should specify th those UV lamps were not pointed down they were pointed up so not pointed down they were pointed up so like kids if we look if the kids were like kids if we look if the kids were looking at the devices they were not you looking at the devices they were not you know being directly exposed to it but in know being directly exposed to it but in ter but you know there is I mean ter but you know there is I mean Ed can tell you a lot about current UV Ed can tell you a lot about current UV uh research there's a lot of research on uh research there's a lot of research on a particular type of UV light of band a particular type of UV light of band UVC which looks to be quite effective um UVC which looks to be quite effective um at knocking out Airborne uh pathogens at knocking out Airborne uh pathogens and is is very safe now there have there and is is very safe now there have there has been a debate about you know if you has been a debate about you know if you have UV running in the air just is it is have UV running in the air just is it is it the UV reacting with molecules in the it the UV reacting with molecules in the air could that be you know create air could that be you know create harmful molecules in terms of breathing harmful molecules in terms of breathing it in but there's a lot of research it in but there's a lot of research trying to figure out maybe we can find trying to figure out maybe we can find ways to just minimize that so the the ways to just minimize that so the the there's a lot of research right now on there's a lot of research right now on UVC light for Airborne infection but UVC light for Airborne infection but there are lots of other ways that should there are lots of other ways that should clarify to to stop an clarify to to stop an Airborne uh pathogen some of you are Airborne uh pathogen some of you are wearing masks masks help to reduce that wearing masks masks help to reduce that risk um opening Windows ventilation risk um opening Windows ventilation systems so like a number of scientists systems so like a number of scientists actually last year said we need mandates actually last year said we need mandates on ventilation systems and buildings on ventilation systems and buildings like like it's not enough to just like like it's not enough to just encourage people to design buildings encourage people to design buildings that get circulated filtered air and that get circulated filtered air and purified air we need requirements um purified air we need requirements um just like we have other requirements we just like we have other requirements we have requirements for clean water like have requirements for clean water like we don't just sort of hope that our we don't just sort of hope that our water is clean coming out of the faucet water is clean coming out of the faucet um so it the you the the ultraviolet um so it the you the the ultraviolet part is of the story is just one part of part is of the story is just one part of a bigger story of trying to keep our air a bigger story of trying to keep our air safe okay one last safe okay one last question I I want to go back to the question I I want to go back to the previous question about testing water previous question about testing water supplies for covid I think one of the supplies for covid I think one of the reasons that worked was that you could reasons that worked was that you could use something like poly Maries chain PCR use something like poly Maries chain PCR techniques to look for one specific techniques to look for one specific thing if you were trying to look for a thing if you were trying to look for a whole slew of things it would be a lot whole slew of things it would be a lot more difficult but I think for example more difficult but I think for example you could use use air conditioner you could use use air conditioner filters uh as a trap for trapping filters uh as a trap for trapping organisms for example legioner disease organisms for example legioner disease if you were looking for something if you were looking for something specific if you specific if you have just a collection of lots of things have just a collection of lots of things uh you would get a really large uh you would get a really large databases of things and then wanting to databases of things and then wanting to try to see which of those was pathogenic try to see which of those was pathogenic becomes another different problem you becomes another different problem you would have to see if it infected would have to see if it infected something and cause some disease so it something and cause some disease so it would be a much bigger problem yeah well would be a much bigger problem yeah well the the the reason that uh there has the the the reason that uh there has been hope about creating these sort of been hope about creating these sort of air sort of the the ultimate air Wells air sort of the the ultimate air Wells air centrifuge which would like capture air centrifuge which would like capture things in the air and tell you exactly things in the air and tell you exactly what they were in real time uh uh one what they were in real time uh uh one reason for the Hope about this is that reason for the Hope about this is that DNA and RNA sequencing has gotten so DNA and RNA sequencing has gotten so good that you can just basically like good that you can just basically like read stuff out and you don't need PCR read stuff out and you don't need PCR there are other kinds of Technologies so there are other kinds of Technologies so that you can actually just that you can actually just see it all and just match it up to see it all and just match it up to what's known in our databases again what's known in our databases again assuming our databases stay online I assuming our databases stay online I can't guarantee that um but if they do can't guarantee that um but if they do then these devices would be able to say then these devices would be able to say like oh guess what you know we see like oh guess what you know we see influenza in the air we see this we see influenza in the air we see this we see that or we see something that we haven't that or we see something that we haven't seen before that concerns us like maybe seen before that concerns us like maybe this is a Corona virus that is not in this is a Corona virus that is not in our database that's the hope that's our database that's the hope that's where things may go in the future where things may go in the future this was a great why don't we thank Carl this was a great why don't we thank Carl Zimmer again thank you and you and you and uh and if you walk across there's maybe uh and if you walk across there's maybe some cheese cubes and then if you buy some cheese cubes and then if you buy there's no cheese cubes today and then there's no cheese cubes today and then when you buy a book you can uh you can when you buy a book you can uh you can ask a question
