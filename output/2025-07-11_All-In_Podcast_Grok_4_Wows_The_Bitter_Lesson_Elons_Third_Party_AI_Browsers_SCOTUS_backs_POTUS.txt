You know, as you probably heard, on July 4th was the first time in heard, on July 4th was the first time in recorded history that there were no recorded history that there were no shootings or no murders in New York on shootings or no murders in New York on that day. So, right now, things are in that day. So, right now, things are in pretty good shape, but we may be maybe pretty good shape, but we may be maybe leaving New York quickly. leaving New York quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to probably want to &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to probably want to sell that place if you got one there sell that place if you got one there because Mami is going to seize it and because Mami is going to seize it and turn it into a drugstore for you. Yes, turn it into a drugstore for you. Yes, it's going to be it's going to be drug stores. Travis Kalanick is back drug stores. Travis Kalanick is back with us. How you doing, bestie? with us. How you doing, bestie? &gt;&gt; Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. Second appearance here on the round Second appearance here on the round table and uh third time on the show. Of table and uh third time on the show. Of course, you spoke at the summit. You've course, you spoke at the summit. You've been busy with cloud kitchens. Yeah. been busy with cloud kitchens. Yeah. Lots of exciting things going on. Lots of exciting things going on. &gt;&gt; Oh, lots of stuff. Lots of stuff. The &gt;&gt; Oh, lots of stuff. Lots of stuff. The robots the robots are taking over. We're robots the robots are taking over. We're we're rolling out. We're rolling out we're rolling out. We're rolling out robots. Yeah. robots. Yeah. robots. Yeah. &gt;&gt; TK, can you tell us what you're doing &gt;&gt; TK, can you tell us what you're doing with this Pony AI thing or not? That's with this Pony AI thing or not? That's speculation. speculation. speculation. &gt;&gt; Uh look, you know, obviously is autonomy &gt;&gt; Uh look, you know, obviously is autonomy as we, you know, in the US we have of as we, you know, in the US we have of course. Wait, do you want to just frame course. Wait, do you want to just frame for people that don't that may not be up for people that don't that may not be up to speed what was announced or at least to speed what was announced or at least &gt;&gt; Why don't you frame it? So, why don't &gt;&gt; Why don't you frame it? So, why don't you AI is um an autonomous company doing you AI is um an autonomous company doing self-driving? It's one of the few uh self-driving? It's one of the few uh players that actually have cars on the players that actually have cars on the road. They're based in China. They've road. They're based in China. They've got a lot of operations in the Middle got a lot of operations in the Middle East. They've got a deal with um a East. They've got a deal with um a delivery company called Uber, which you delivery company called Uber, which you might be familiar with. might be familiar with. &gt;&gt; Uh okay. So &gt;&gt; Uh okay. So look, look, look, &gt;&gt; well the deal was basically that you &gt;&gt; well the deal was basically that you would partner with Uber, license in the would partner with Uber, license in the pony technology and essentially start a pony technology and essentially start a competitor I guess to Whimo and Tesla. competitor I guess to Whimo and Tesla. &gt;&gt; Let me work on this one. Okay. So So in &gt;&gt; Let me work on this one. Okay. So So in the US we have Whimo. We see the Whimos the US we have Whimo. We see the Whimos in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, coming soon to Miami, coming soon to coming soon to Miami, coming soon to Atlanta, coming soon to DC. They're even Atlanta, coming soon to DC. They're even talking about New York. talking about New York. Tesla's sort of like the, you know, Tesla's sort of like the, you know, they're doing it the hard way, you know, they're doing it the hard way, you know, classic Elon style, like let's classic Elon style, like let's let's do this sort of in a fundamental let's do this sort of in a fundamental holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's go all the way kind of holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's go all the way kind of kind of approach. Uh, and it's unclear kind of approach. Uh, and it's unclear when it gets over the line. Of course, when it gets over the line. Of course, he he launched sort of a a semi he he launched sort of a a semi semi-pilot of sorts in Austin recently, semi-pilot of sorts in Austin recently, but there's no other alternatives. So but there's no other alternatives. So what happens is is some of the folks who what happens is is some of the folks who are interested in making sure there are are interested in making sure there are alternatives alternatives alternatives have reached out they they've reached have reached out they they've reached out to me and there different out to me and there different discussions they get going because discussions they get going because they're like Travis you did autonomy way they're like Travis you did autonomy way back in the day got the Uber autonomous back in the day got the Uber autonomous stuff going in 2014 stuff going in 2014 maybe there's something to do here to maybe there's something to do here to create optionality now maybe like I'm of create optionality now maybe like I'm of course very interested on the food side course very interested on the food side I talk about autonom onous burritos I talk about autonom onous burritos being a big deal because if you can being a big deal because if you can automate the kitchen, the production of automate the kitchen, the production of food and then you can automate the sort food and then you can automate the sort of logistics around food, you take huge of logistics around food, you take huge amount of costs out of the food out of amount of costs out of the food out of what's going on in food and that's of what's going on in food and that's of course near and dear to my heart. course near and dear to my heart. There's folks of course that want to see There's folks of course that want to see autonomy and mobility. That's a real autonomy and mobility. That's a real thing. It it may be that or I would say thing. It it may be that or I would say if you get the autonomy problem right, if you get the autonomy problem right, you can use it to apply to both you can use it to apply to both problems. So there's a lot of folks problems. So there's a lot of folks interested in interested in interested in moving things, moving food, moving moving things, moving food, moving people. And if there is some kind of people. And if there is some kind of autonomous autonomous autonomous technology that maybe I get involved in, technology that maybe I get involved in, it might apply to a bunch of different it might apply to a bunch of different things. And so I've got some inbound. things. And so I've got some inbound. Let's just put it that way. There's no Let's just put it that way. There's no there's no real deal right now, but there's no real deal right now, but there is definitely some inbound. And I there is definitely some inbound. And I think there is some news about some of think there is some news about some of that inbound that may or may not be that inbound that may or may not be occurring. That's probably the best way occurring. That's probably the best way to put it. That is long-winded. I'll try to put it. That is long-winded. I'll try to tighten that up next time. to tighten that up next time. &gt;&gt; No, no, I think it's great to get the &gt;&gt; No, no, I think it's great to get the overview here first on uh overview here first on uh &gt;&gt; allin. Thank you for sharing it with us. &gt;&gt; allin. Thank you for sharing it with us. And everybody knows you have And everybody knows you have &gt;&gt; been doing a bowl builder lab 37 I think &gt;&gt; been doing a bowl builder lab 37 I think it's called. We throw it up on the it's called. We throw it up on the screen. Not sure what the status of it screen. Not sure what the status of it is. And then I'll let you go, Chimath, is. And then I'll let you go, Chimath, with your follow-up question. But with your follow-up question. But &gt;&gt; I I think there's a pretty interesting &gt;&gt; I I think there's a pretty interesting concept here of the bowl getting built concept here of the bowl getting built &gt;&gt; and then put into a self-driving car. &gt;&gt; and then put into a self-driving car. &gt;&gt; Now, that machine looks huge, but it's &gt;&gt; Now, that machine looks huge, but it's actually 60 square feet. actually 60 square feet. &gt;&gt; That picture makes it look monstrous. &gt;&gt; That picture makes it look monstrous. It's a 60 foot machine like uh imagine It's a 60 foot machine like uh imagine running like a Sweet Green like brand or running like a Sweet Green like brand or a Chipotle like brand and just making it a Chipotle like brand and just making it so it comes to life for people who so it comes to life for people who &gt;&gt; who you know are like, "Hey, what is &gt;&gt; who you know are like, "Hey, what is this thing?" Imagine you just order this thing?" Imagine you just order online exactly the kind of bowl you want online exactly the kind of bowl you want and actually this machine could run like and actually this machine could run like many brands at the same time and and many brands at the same time and and does you build the bowl you want does you build the bowl you want whatever ingredients uh it sort of it if whatever ingredients uh it sort of it if you look at that bottom you see those you look at that bottom you see those little white bricks at the bottom that's little white bricks at the bottom that's what carries the bowl underneath what carries the bowl underneath dispensers it fills up the machine puts dispensers it fills up the machine puts a it sauces the the bowl then it puts a a it sauces the the bowl then it puts a lid on it takes the bowl puts it in a lid on it takes the bowl puts it in a bag uh puts utensils in the bag seals bag uh puts utensils in the bag seals the bag and the bag goes down a conveyor the bag and the bag goes down a conveyor belt where then another machine what we belt where then another machine what we would call an AGV takes the bull to the would call an AGV takes the bull to the front of house. The bull gets put into a front of house. The bull gets put into a locker. The courier be a Door Dash who locker. The courier be a Door Dash who breeds courier will wave their app in breeds courier will wave their app in front of a camera and it will open up front of a camera and it will open up the locker that has the food that the locker that has the food that they're supposed to pick up. So it just they're supposed to pick up. So it just it takes out a lot of what we would call it takes out a lot of what we would call the the cost of assembly. um which is the the cost of assembly. um which is more more more &gt;&gt; reduces mistakes, right? I mean a &gt;&gt; reduces mistakes, right? I mean a mistake. Yeah, mistake. Yeah, mistake. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know exactly how many grams of every &gt;&gt; we know exactly how many grams of every ingredient are put in. That's exactly ingredient are put in. That's exactly what you're supposed to get what you're supposed to get &gt;&gt; and so you get a higher quality product. &gt;&gt; and so you get a higher quality product. It takes a lot of the cost out. You It takes a lot of the cost out. You imagine ultimately that's going to be imagine ultimately that's going to be they're going to be couriers with that they're going to be couriers with that as well that you know I like to say as well that you know I like to say autonomous burritos like is a Whimo autonomous burritos like is a Whimo gonna carry a burrito or is Tesla going gonna carry a burrito or is Tesla going to have a a machine that carries food or to have a a machine that carries food or you know is there another another you know is there another another company that ends up doing you know sort company that ends up doing you know sort of the the the things the the the the of the the the things the the the the autonomous delivery of things and the autonomous delivery of things and the point is is well where we are right now point is is well where we are right now is we've got customers and so those is we've got customers and so those customers are starting to deploy customers are starting to deploy this quarter and it's pretty this quarter and it's pretty interesting. I mean you can the in our interesting. I mean you can the in our delivery kitchens delivery kitchens delivery kitchens the cost of labor is about 30% of the cost of labor is about 30% of revenue. That's what the successful guy revenue. That's what the successful guy let's say 30% 35% of revenue in a in a let's say 30% 35% of revenue in a in a brickandmortar in a brick and mortar brickandmortar in a brick and mortar restaurants it's even higher. Okay. restaurants it's even higher. Okay. &gt;&gt; When they're running our machine it's &gt;&gt; When they're running our machine it's between seven and 10% of revenue. between seven and 10% of revenue. Right. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Then you take out the cost of &gt;&gt; Amazing. Then you take out the cost of the delivery, you know, and now it's the delivery, you know, and now it's becoming everybody can have a private becoming everybody can have a private chef, which was your original vision for chef, which was your original vision for Uber was people don't know the original Uber was people don't know the original tagline, but it was your your p tagline, but it was your your p everybody has a private driver. everybody has a private driver. &gt;&gt; Everyone's private driver was the &gt;&gt; Everyone's private driver was the original for Uber. Basically, the original for Uber. Basically, the infrastructure was already there. And I infrastructure was already there. And I said this on, you know, one of your said this on, you know, one of your recent, I think it was at the All-In recent, I think it was at the All-In Summit, Jason, but like um Summit, Jason, but like um in the mobility, cars, you know, I in the mobility, cars, you know, I transport uh space, the roads were transport uh space, the roads were already there. The cars were already already there. The cars were already built. People weren't using their cars built. People weren't using their cars 98% of the day. So the infrastructure is 98% of the day. So the infrastructure is already there to get people around already there to get people around &gt;&gt; to do this as a service and do it very &gt;&gt; to do this as a service and do it very efficiently and conveniently efficiently and conveniently &gt;&gt; with food. The infrastructure is not &gt;&gt; with food. The infrastructure is not there. Like yes, restaurants have excess there. Like yes, restaurants have excess capacity. That's what Uber Eatats capacity. That's what Uber Eatats utilizes. But to go and say like let's utilizes. But to go and say like let's make 30% of all meals in a in a city uh make 30% of all meals in a in a city uh sort of prepared and delivered by a sort of prepared and delivered by a service, the infrastructure is not service, the infrastructure is not there. So you have to build it. So our there. So you have to build it. So our company that the mission is uh company that the mission is uh infrastructure for better food. So infrastructure for better food. So that's real estate, that's software and that's real estate, that's software and robotics for the production and delivery robotics for the production and delivery of food in this super efficient way. of food in this super efficient way. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh Keith, what are your &gt;&gt; All right. Uh Keith, what are your thoughts? Any questions for thoughts? Any questions for &gt;&gt; Well, he's not here, but isn't this what &gt;&gt; Well, he's not here, but isn't this what David Freeberg tried to do a few years David Freeberg tried to do a few years ago? ago? ago? &gt;&gt; Yeah. This came up on the last Allin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This came up on the last Allin. Yeah. Or the last one I was at. Yeah. Yeah. Or the last one I was at. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. pizza. Pizza. The problem was I &gt;&gt; Yeah. pizza. Pizza. The problem was I told Freeberg, "People don't want to eat told Freeberg, "People don't want to eat quinoa. quinoa. quinoa. &gt;&gt; You got to put a a little steak in &gt;&gt; You got to put a a little steak in there, maybe a piece of salmon." But he there, maybe a piece of salmon." But he was kind of rel I think eventually he was kind of rel I think eventually he relented and let people have a little relented and let people have a little bit of protein. Uh but yeah, it's such a bit of protein. Uh but yeah, it's such a great vision. And great vision. And &gt;&gt; wait, he he died as a vegan martyr. &gt;&gt; wait, he he died as a vegan martyr. &gt;&gt; I think the business died as martyr. &gt;&gt; I think the business died as martyr. &gt;&gt; Well, that was the hill he was led to. &gt;&gt; Well, that was the hill he was led to. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people have died on &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people have died on that hill. But the bottom line is if that hill. But the bottom line is if you're going to get into automation, you you're going to get into automation, you have to it has to be endto-end have to it has to be endto-end automation. And what I mean by that is automation. And what I mean by that is like there are pizza there are pizza like there are pizza companies that have come and gone companies that have come and gone automated pizza companies where it's automated pizza companies where it's like we have a pizza machine and like we have a pizza machine and everybody's like yeah this is amazing everybody's like yeah this is amazing and you have a guy you have a and you have a guy you have a million-dollar pizza machine and then on million-dollar pizza machine and then on the left you have a guy feeding the left you have a guy feeding ingredients into the pizza machine and ingredients into the pizza machine and on the right you have a guy taking the on the right you have a guy taking the pizza out and then putting it in a box pizza out and then putting it in a box and doing all this. So instead of one and doing all this. So instead of one guy making pizzas, I have a guy making pizzas, I have a million-dollar machine and two guys million-dollar machine and two guys making pizza. And so when you look at making pizza. And so when you look at these auton like robotic food production these auton like robotic food production machines or food assembly machines, you machines or food assembly machines, you have to look at the full stack and say have to look at the full stack and say does it work with the ecosystem that does it work with the ecosystem that exists in a restaurant and does it go exists in a restaurant and does it go full stack from you know like like we full stack from you know like like we have this thing that machine we saw have this thing that machine we saw earlier. The staff preps the food, they earlier. The staff preps the food, they put the food in the machine and then put the food in the machine and then they leave. they leave. they leave. &gt;&gt; They're gone. This restaurant runs &gt;&gt; They're gone. This restaurant runs itself for many hours without anybody itself for many hours without anybody there. there. there. &gt;&gt; But this could be McDonald's, Burger &gt;&gt; But this could be McDonald's, Burger King, and Taco Bell. Nobody would know King, and Taco Bell. Nobody would know &gt;&gt; that right there. That machine is a it's &gt;&gt; that right there. That machine is a it's an assembly machine, right? The food is an assembly machine, right? The food is prepped by humans and then assembled by prepped by humans and then assembled by this machine. For a Chipotle or a sweet this machine. For a Chipotle or a sweet green, this is like a a majority of green, this is like a a majority of their labor, right? You go up to a their labor, right? You go up to a Chipotle, there's like 10 guys at lunch Chipotle, there's like 10 guys at lunch and you're still in line. That machine and you're still in line. That machine right there does 300 bulls an hour, right there does 300 bulls an hour, right? And so you go, okay, that's the right? And so you go, okay, that's the this is what's called um like the this is what's called um like the assembly line. It's just that front line assembly line. It's just that front line where you basically assemble things. I where you basically assemble things. I think sometimes I call it the make line. think sometimes I call it the make line. &gt;&gt; What will happen over time is you'll &gt;&gt; What will happen over time is you'll have perpendicular lines going into it have perpendicular lines going into it where you're producing food, where you're producing food, &gt;&gt; right? So you'll have a production or &gt;&gt; right? So you'll have a production or bake line going into an assembly line bake line going into an assembly line here and then you go, "Oh, wow." So you here and then you go, "Oh, wow." So you have it something that dispenses burgers have it something that dispenses burgers on buns. That's the dispenser. That's on buns. That's the dispenser. That's the assembly, the assembly, the assembly, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But Factorio on steroids basically. &gt;&gt; But Factorio on steroids basically. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's like how do you cook &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's like how do you cook that burger? That's what I call that's that burger? That's what I call that's what we call state change. So state what we call state change. So state change is the is the cooking of the change is the is the cooking of the food. assembly is the like how do I put food. assembly is the like how do I put it together and plate it. it together and plate it. &gt;&gt; Doesn't this collapse like for example &gt;&gt; Doesn't this collapse like for example if you have a yield of 300 per hour you if you have a yield of 300 per hour you said out of that one machine? said out of that one machine? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Very quickly you can imputee the value &gt;&gt; Very quickly you can imputee the value &gt;&gt; of having a smaller footprint store with &gt;&gt; of having a smaller footprint store with five of these things in a faceless five of these things in a faceless warehouse with drone delivery or cars. warehouse with drone delivery or cars. You don't need the physical You don't need the physical infrastructure. infrastructure. infrastructure. &gt;&gt; So then don't you create a wasteland of &gt;&gt; So then don't you create a wasteland of real estate or how do you repurpose all real estate or how do you repurpose all the real estate? Well, the way to think the real estate? Well, the way to think about it is like 90% of well, it's about it is like 90% of well, it's probably a little lower than that right probably a little lower than that right now. Let's say 85% of all meals in the now. Let's say 85% of all meals in the US are at home. They just are. US are at home. They just are. &gt;&gt; And a vast majority of those meals are &gt;&gt; And a vast majority of those meals are cooked at home. So, you know, like Uber cooked at home. So, you know, like Uber Eats and Door Dash, they represent like Eats and Door Dash, they represent like 1.8% or 2% of all meals right now. It's 1.8% or 2% of all meals right now. It's very tiny, right? So what you're doing very tiny, right? So what you're doing is you're using real estate to and is you're using real estate to and infrastructure to prepare and deliver infrastructure to prepare and deliver meals to people at their homes. And so meals to people at their homes. And so it's not the restaurants still exist. it's not the restaurants still exist. We're still going to want to go to We're still going to want to go to restaurants. We're still going to want restaurants. We're still going to want to go outside. We learned that during co to go outside. We learned that during co we knew it before. We definitely know it we knew it before. We definitely know it after. Um and so I don't it's not really after. Um and so I don't it's not really like a decimating real estate situation. like a decimating real estate situation. It's taking a thing we used to do for It's taking a thing we used to do for ourselves and creating a service that ourselves and creating a service that does it higher quality. You know, sort does it higher quality. You know, sort of I like to say you don't have to be of I like to say you don't have to be wealthy to be healthy wealthy to be healthy and just infrastructure to get that cost and just infrastructure to get that cost down. down. down. &gt;&gt; And so you're doing something as a &gt;&gt; And so you're doing something as a service that we used to do at home. service that we used to do at home. &gt;&gt; I think in the super long run you're &gt;&gt; I think in the super long run you're like what where's the story on grocery like what where's the story on grocery stores? If you go to like in in 20 stores? If you go to like in in 20 years, I think everybody agrees, years, I think everybody agrees, you you will have machines making very you you will have machines making very high quality, very personalized meals high quality, very personalized meals for everybody. for everybody. for everybody. &gt;&gt; This will be good for Keith because he &gt;&gt; This will be good for Keith because he measures stuff down to like five measures stuff down to like five calories based on his Instagram. calories based on his Instagram. &gt;&gt; What's your What's your What's your body &gt;&gt; What's your What's your What's your body fat? Like seven%. fat? Like seven%. &gt;&gt; It's like &gt;&gt; It's like &gt;&gt; Just open his Instagram. He posted four &gt;&gt; Just open his Instagram. He posted four times today about his body fat. like so times today about his body fat. like so disgusted with himself at 10%. disgusted with himself at 10%. &gt;&gt; It's like bad at 10. But um I actually &gt;&gt; It's like bad at 10. But um I actually think the vision of this actually the think the vision of this actually the natural implication and maybe the home natural implication and maybe the home run version of this is everybody has a run version of this is everybody has a private chef in their house, a robot in private chef in their house, a robot in their house that actually does this their house that actually does this personalized because people do want to personalized because people do want to cook at home, but they don't have the cook at home, but they don't have the time. time. time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or space uh and infrastructure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or space uh and infrastructure. But man, these delivery services are But man, these delivery services are charging. Rich people do this all the charging. Rich people do this all the time, right? They do these crazy meal time, right? They do these crazy meal delivery services for 200 bucks a day delivery services for 200 bucks a day and this is just going to abstract it and this is just going to abstract it down to everybody and man people get down to everybody and man people get creative when there's that empty space creative when there's that empty space to your point Jimoth about what happens to your point Jimoth about what happens to all this space. When I lived in New to all this space. When I lived in New York in the 80s and 90s it was common to York in the 80s and 90s it was common to in Tribeca in West Chelsea where I lived in Tribeca in West Chelsea where I lived to take storefronts put your little to take storefronts put your little architect's office in the front and live architect's office in the front and live in the back. And many people were in the back. And many people were hacking real estate. We still need five, hacking real estate. We still need five, 10 million homes in this country. And 10 million homes in this country. And they're already doing this with malls. I they're already doing this with malls. I I I keep seeing malls being turned into I I keep seeing malls being turned into colleges and creative spaces. One of colleges and creative spaces. One of them in Boston, they turned like the them in Boston, they turned like the second and third floor into studio second and third floor into studio apartments for artists. So, you know, apartments for artists. So, you know, where there's a will, there's a way we where there's a will, there's a way we could use the space. I mean, could use the space. I mean, &gt;&gt; yeah. Where this goes, what Chimamas &gt;&gt; yeah. Where this goes, what Chimamas saying and where the real estate goes is saying and where the real estate goes is we call it the internet food court we call it the internet food court where, you know, you're on Amazon, where, you know, you're on Amazon, right? It's the everything store. Now right? It's the everything store. Now imagine that for food and then imagine imagine that for food and then imagine you have an 8,000 foot facility where you have an 8,000 foot facility where basically anything can be made. basically anything can be made. &gt;&gt; Anything can be made &gt;&gt; Anything can be made &gt;&gt; because if you have that machine you saw &gt;&gt; because if you have that machine you saw has 18 sort of dispensers for food, 10 has 18 sort of dispensers for food, 10 different sauces. You get the idea. Now different sauces. You get the idea. Now what what about when it's 50 or 100 what what about when it's 50 or 100 dispensers for food? What if you have dispensers for food? What if you have multiple machines with a 100 dispensers multiple machines with a 100 dispensers for food? for food? for food? &gt;&gt; That's crazy. you can the combinatorial &gt;&gt; That's crazy. you can the combinatorial math in terms of what's possible, what math in terms of what's possible, what can be made sort of, you know, goes can be made sort of, you know, goes exponential and so exponential and so the internet food court is sort of the the internet food court is sort of the vision for where this all goes. vision for where this all goes. &gt;&gt; Another example of the bitter lesson. &gt;&gt; Another example of the bitter lesson. &gt;&gt; The bitter Yeah, we're going to get to &gt;&gt; The bitter Yeah, we're going to get to that, I guess, today that, I guess, today in a very full docket. Before we get to in a very full docket. Before we get to that, just a little bit of housekeeping that, just a little bit of housekeeping here. here. here. September 7th, 8th, 9th in Los Angeles, September 7th, 8th, 9th in Los Angeles, the All-In Summit again, all-in.com yada the All-In Summit again, all-in.com yada yada yada. The lineup is stacked and yada yada. The lineup is stacked and we're gonna start announcing the we're gonna start announcing the speakers. People have been begging us to speakers. People have been begging us to announce the speakers. announce the speakers. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; You got to hold some back. Careful, &gt;&gt; You got to hold some back. Careful, careful. careful. careful. &gt;&gt; Hold a couple back, but we got some &gt;&gt; Hold a couple back, but we got some really nice speakers lined up. It is really nice speakers lined up. It is going to be extraordinary. going to be extraordinary. &gt;&gt; It is. It is the best one yet. &gt;&gt; It is. It is the best one yet. &gt;&gt; I mean, every year we have this done. &gt;&gt; I mean, every year we have this done. Yeah. Yeah. Every year we have this Yeah. Yeah. Every year we have this little bit of panic like um you know we little bit of panic like um you know we going to get great speakers and man they going to get great speakers and man they started flowing in this week it's going started flowing in this week it's going to be extraordinary to be extraordinary almost as extraordinary as this almost as extraordinary as this delicious tequila behind my head here. delicious tequila behind my head here. Get the allin tequila at Get the allin tequila at tequila.allin.com. tequila.allin.com. tequila.allin.com. Deliveries begin late summer.

You can't even tell tell tell right there. right there. right there. &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Lots to discuss this week. Obviously AI &gt;&gt; Lots to discuss this week. Obviously AI is continuing to be the big story in our is continuing to be the big story in our industry and for good reason. Our bestie industry and for good reason. Our bestie uh Elon released Gro 4 Wednesday night. uh Elon released Gro 4 Wednesday night. Two versions, base model and a heavy Two versions, base model and a heavy model. 30 bucks a month for the base. model. 30 bucks a month for the base. $300 a month for this heavy model which $300 a month for this heavy model which has a very unique feature. You can have has a very unique feature. You can have a multi- aent feature. I got to see this a multi- aent feature. I got to see this actually when I visited XAI a couple of actually when I visited XAI a couple of weeks ago where multiple agents work on weeks ago where multiple agents work on the same problem then they and they do the same problem then they and they do that simultaneously obviously and then that simultaneously obviously and then compare each other's work and it gives compare each other's work and it gives you kind of like a study group the best you kind of like a study group the best answer uh by consensus really answer uh by consensus really interesting according to artificial interesting according to artificial analysis benchmarks you can pull that up analysis benchmarks you can pull that up Nick Gro 4 base model has surpassed Nick Gro 4 base model has surpassed OpenAI's 03 pro Google Gemini's 2.5 pro OpenAI's 03 pro Google Gemini's 2.5 pro as the most intelligent model as the most intelligent model includes like seven different industry includes like seven different industry standard evaluation tests. You can look standard evaluation tests. You can look it up, but reasoning, math, coding, all it up, but reasoning, math, coding, all that kind of stuff. This is, you know, that kind of stuff. This is, you know, book smarts, not necessarily street book smarts, not necessarily street smart. So, it doesn't mean that these smart. So, it doesn't mean that these things can reason. And obviously there things can reason. And obviously there was a little um there was a little was a little um there was a little kurluffle on um X formerly known as kurluffle on um X formerly known as Twitter where XAI got a little frisky Twitter where XAI got a little frisky and was saying all kinds of crazy stuff and was saying all kinds of crazy stuff and needed to uh maybe be redteamed a and needed to uh maybe be redteamed a little bit more decisively. little bit more decisively. Many of you know Grock 4 was trained on Many of you know Grock 4 was trained on Colossus. That's that giant data center Colossus. That's that giant data center that Elon's been building. And we showed that Elon's been building. And we showed the chart here. Shimoth, the chart here. Shimoth, you sent us a link to the bitter lesson you sent us a link to the bitter lesson by uh Rich Sutton in the group chat. by uh Rich Sutton in the group chat. That's the 2019 blog post. We'll pull it That's the 2019 blog post. We'll pull it up here for people to take a look at and up here for people to take a look at and we'll put it in the show notes. Maybe we'll put it in the show notes. Maybe just generally, just generally, just generally, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; your reaction to both how quickly Elon &gt;&gt; your reaction to both how quickly Elon has, and that chart showed it, how has, and that chart showed it, how quickly Elon has caught up quickly Elon has caught up &gt;&gt; and I don't think people expected him to &gt;&gt; and I don't think people expected him to take the lead, but here we are. Before take the lead, but here we are. Before we start, Nick, can you please show we start, Nick, can you please show Elon's tweet about how they did on the Elon's tweet about how they did on the AGI benchmark? It's absolutely AGI benchmark? It's absolutely incredible. incredible. incredible. Two things. One is how quickly starting Two things. One is how quickly starting in March of 2023, so we're talking about in March of 2023, so we're talking about less than 2 and 1/2 years, what this less than 2 and 1/2 years, what this team has accomplished team has accomplished and how far ahead they are of everybody and how far ahead they are of everybody else. that's demonstrated by this. But else. that's demonstrated by this. But the second is a fundamental the second is a fundamental architectural decision that Elon made architectural decision that Elon made which I think we didn't fully appreciate which I think we didn't fully appreciate until now. And it maps to an until now. And it maps to an architectural decision he made at Tesla architectural decision he made at Tesla as well. And for all we know, we'll as well. And for all we know, we'll figure out that he made an equivalent figure out that he made an equivalent decision at SpaceX. And that decision is decision at SpaceX. And that decision is really well encapsulated by this essay, really well encapsulated by this essay, the bitter lesson by Rich Sutton. And the bitter lesson by Rich Sutton. And Nick, if you can just throw this up Nick, if you can just throw this up there, but just to summarize what this there, but just to summarize what this says, it basically says in a nutshell says, it basically says in a nutshell that you're always better off when that you're always better off when you're trying to solve an AI problem you're trying to solve an AI problem taking a general learning approach that taking a general learning approach that can scale with computation because it can scale with computation because it ultimately proves to be the most ultimately proves to be the most effective. And the alternative would be effective. And the alternative would be something that's much more human labored something that's much more human labored and human involved that requires human and human involved that requires human knowledge. And so the first method, what knowledge. And so the first method, what it essentially allows you to do is view it essentially allows you to do is view any problem as an endless scalable any problem as an endless scalable search or learning task. And as it's search or learning task. And as it's turned out, whether it's chess or go or turned out, whether it's chess or go or speech recognition or computer vision, speech recognition or computer vision, whenever there was two competing whenever there was two competing approaches, one that used general approaches, one that used general computation and one that used human computation and one that used human knowledge, the general computation knowledge, the general computation problem always won. And so it creates problem always won. And so it creates this bitter lesson for humans that want this bitter lesson for humans that want to think that we are at the center of to think that we are at the center of all of this critical learning and all of all of this critical learning and all of these leaps. In more AI specific these leaps. In more AI specific language, what it means is that a lot of language, what it means is that a lot of these systems create these embeddings these systems create these embeddings that are just not understandable by that are just not understandable by humans at all, but it yields incredible humans at all, but it yields incredible results. results. results. So why is this crazy? Well, he made this So why is this crazy? Well, he made this huge bet on this 100,000 GPU cluster. huge bet on this 100,000 GPU cluster. People thought, "Wow, that's a lot. Is People thought, "Wow, that's a lot. Is it going to bear fruit?" Then he said, it going to bear fruit?" Then he said, "No, actually, I'm scaling it up to "No, actually, I'm scaling it up to 250,000." Then he said, "It's going to 250,000." Then he said, "It's going to scale up to a million." And what these scale up to a million." And what these results show is a general computational results show is a general computational approach that doesn't require as much approach that doesn't require as much human labeling can actually get to the human labeling can actually get to the answer and better answers faster. That answer and better answers faster. That has huge implications because if you has huge implications because if you think about all these other companies, think about all these other companies, what is Llama been doing? They just what is Llama been doing? They just spent 15 billion to buy 49% of scale AI. spent 15 billion to buy 49% of scale AI. That's exactly a bet on human knowledge. That's exactly a bet on human knowledge. What is Gemini doing? What is OpenAI What is Gemini doing? What is OpenAI doing? What is Anthropic doing? So all doing? What is Anthropic doing? So all these things come into question. And these things come into question. And then the last thing I'll say is if you then the last thing I'll say is if you look back, he made this bet once before, look back, he made this bet once before, which was Tesla FSD versus Whimo. And which was Tesla FSD versus Whimo. And Tesla FSD only had cameras. It didn't Tesla FSD only had cameras. It didn't have LAR. But the bet was, I'll just have LAR. But the bet was, I'll just collect billions and billions of driving collect billions and billions of driving miles before anybody else does and apply miles before anybody else does and apply general compute and it'll get to general compute and it'll get to autonomy faster than the other more autonomy faster than the other more laborious and very expensive approach. laborious and very expensive approach. So I just think it's an incredible So I just think it's an incredible moment in technology where we see so moment in technology where we see so many examples. Travis is another one many examples. Travis is another one what he's just talked about. You know, what he's just talked about. You know, the bitter lesson is you could believe the bitter lesson is you could believe that, you know, food is this immutable that, you know, food is this immutable thing that's made meticulously by hand thing that's made meticulously by hand by these individuals, or you can take by these individuals, or you can take this general purpose computer approach, this general purpose computer approach, which is what he took, waited for these which is what he took, waited for these cost curves to come into play, and now cost curves to come into play, and now you can scale food to every human on you can scale food to every human on Earth. I I just think it's a it's so Earth. I I just think it's a it's so profoundly important. profoundly important. profoundly important. &gt;&gt; One thing I'll throw out there, Chimoth, &gt;&gt; One thing I'll throw out there, Chimoth, is is is the Tesla approach for autonomy is the Tesla approach for autonomy is taking human knowledge. In fact, the taking human knowledge. In fact, the whole idea is to approximate human human whole idea is to approximate human human driving, right? The is the whole damn driving, right? The is the whole damn thing. Now, depending on your approach thing. Now, depending on your approach in the technology, you can do like in the technology, you can do like what's called an end toend approach or what's called an end toend approach or you can look at okay perception, you can look at okay perception, prediction, planning, uh, and control, prediction, planning, uh, and control, which are like these four modules that which are like these four modules that sort of you you you sort of engineer if sort of you you you sort of engineer if that makes sense. But it's approximating that makes sense. But it's approximating human driving to do it. The difference human driving to do it. The difference is that, is that, is that, you know, I I think Elon's taken a a you know, I I think Elon's taken a a almost a more human approach, which is almost a more human approach, which is like, I've got two eyes. Why can't my like, I've got two eyes. Why can't my car do it like a human? car Why can't my car do it like a human? Like, I don't have any LAR spinning Like, I don't have any LAR spinning around on my head as a human. Why can't around on my head as a human. Why can't my car? So, it's kind of interesting. my car? So, it's kind of interesting. He's sort of taking what you're saying He's sort of taking what you're saying Chimoth on the computation side because Chimoth on the computation side because hardware 5 is coming out on Tesla hardware 5 is coming out on Tesla probably next year probably next year &gt;&gt; which is going to make a big difference &gt;&gt; which is going to make a big difference in what FSD can do. in what FSD can do. &gt;&gt; That's the compute side you're talking &gt;&gt; That's the compute side you're talking about. But then he is approximating about. But then he is approximating human. human. human. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just meant that, you know, other &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just meant that, you know, other than the first versions of FSD, which I than the first versions of FSD, which I think Andre talked about, Andre Carpathy think Andre talked about, Andre Carpathy talked about, talked about, talked about, &gt;&gt; you know, they're not really so &gt;&gt; you know, they're not really so &gt;&gt; reliant anymore on human labeling, per &gt;&gt; reliant anymore on human labeling, per se, right? So that that Yeah, that that se, right? So that that Yeah, that that interference. And then interference. And then &gt;&gt; the other crazy thing that he said &gt;&gt; the other crazy thing that he said subsequent versions of Grock subsequent versions of Grock are not going to be trained on any are not going to be trained on any traditional data set that exists in the traditional data set that exists in the wild. the cumulative sum of human wild. the cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI knowledge has been exhausted in AI training. That happened basically last training. That happened basically last last year. And so the only way to then last year. And so the only way to then supplement that is with synthetic data supplement that is with synthetic data where the AI creates it'll sort of write where the AI creates it'll sort of write an essay or it'll come up with with a an essay or it'll come up with with a thesis and then it will grade itself um thesis and then it will grade itself um and and and sort of go through this and and and sort of go through this process of self-arning with synthetic process of self-arning with synthetic data. He said that he's going to have data. He said that he's going to have agents creating synthetic data from agents creating synthetic data from scratch that then drive all the training scratch that then drive all the training which I just think is it's crazy. which I just think is it's crazy. &gt;&gt; Just explain this concept one more time &gt;&gt; Just explain this concept one more time with a bitter lesson. hand coding with a bitter lesson. hand coding heristics into the computer and saying, heristics into the computer and saying, "Hey, here are specific openings in "Hey, here are specific openings in chess." chess." chess." &gt;&gt; Use Yeah, use chess, right? &gt;&gt; Use Yeah, use chess, right? &gt;&gt; You're hand coding specific examples of &gt;&gt; You're hand coding specific examples of openings in there, end games, etc. openings in there, end games, etc. versus just saying, "Play every possible versus just saying, "Play every possible game, and here's every game we have." game, and here's every game we have." &gt;&gt; So, here's &gt;&gt; So, here's &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, the two approaches would be, &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, the two approaches would be, let's say, like Travis and I were let's say, like Travis and I were building competing versions of a chess building competing versions of a chess solver, and Travis's approach would say, solver, and Travis's approach would say, I'm just going to define the chessboard. I'm just going to define the chessboard. I'm gonna give the players certain I'm gonna give the players certain boundaries in which they can move, boundaries in which they can move, right? So the bishop can only move right? So the bishop can only move diagonally and there's a couple of diagonally and there's a couple of boundary conditions and I'm going to boundary conditions and I'm going to create a reward function and I'm just create a reward function and I'm just going to let the thing self-learn and going to let the thing self-learn and selfplay. That's his version. selfplay. That's his version. And then what happens is when you map And then what happens is when you map out every single permutation out every single permutation when you go and play Keith, who's the when you go and play Keith, who's the best chess player in the world, what best chess player in the world, what you're doing at that point is saying, you're doing at that point is saying, "Okay, Keith made this move." So you "Okay, Keith made this move." So you search for what Keith's move is, and you search for what Keith's move is, and you have a distribution of the best moves have a distribution of the best moves that you could make in response or vice that you could make in response or vice versa. That was the cutting edge versa. That was the cutting edge approach. The different approach which approach. The different approach which is more, you know, what people would is more, you know, what people would think is more quote unquote elegant and think is more quote unquote elegant and less brute force would be Jason for you less brute force would be Jason for you and I to sit there and say, "Okay, if and I to sit there and say, "Okay, if Keith moves here, we should do this. We Keith moves here, we should do this. We should do this specific variation of the should do this specific variation of the Sicilian defense." And Sicilian defense." And &gt;&gt; and it's too much human knowledge. And I &gt;&gt; and it's too much human knowledge. And I think what what it turned out was there think what what it turned out was there was a psychological need for humans to was a psychological need for humans to believe we were part of the answer. believe we were part of the answer. &gt;&gt; But what this is showing is because of &gt;&gt; But what this is showing is because of Moore's law and because of general Moore's law and because of general computation, it's just not necessary. computation, it's just not necessary. You just have to let go, give up You just have to let go, give up control. And that's very hard for some control. And that's very hard for some people and for others. people and for others. &gt;&gt; It's also very hard in some &gt;&gt; It's also very hard in some circumstances where a car is driving circumstances where a car is driving down the road and it's learning in that down the road and it's learning in that process, which is why you need a safety process, which is why you need a safety driver. And and I think Elon made the driver. And and I think Elon made the right decision to put one in there. right decision to put one in there. Keith, your thoughts? Keith, your thoughts? &gt;&gt; Yeah, a a couple points. It's it's not &gt;&gt; Yeah, a a couple points. It's it's not quite that binary. Chimoth, I generally quite that binary. Chimoth, I generally agree with your arc, but like if you agree with your arc, but like if you think about LLMs being the most think about LLMs being the most important unlock in AI, LLMs are all important unlock in AI, LLMs are all trained on human writing. So someone trained on human writing. So someone wrote every piece of data that every LLM wrote every piece of data that every LLM use a human wrote at some point in use a human wrote at some point in history. So yes, it's true that they've history. So yes, it's true that they've shocked everybody including OpenAI's, shocked everybody including OpenAI's, you know, original team on the you know, original team on the implications, the broad implications, implications, the broad implications, the general applicability to almost the general applicability to almost every problem, but it's not like there every problem, but it's not like there was uh some tablets floating in space was uh some tablets floating in space that weren't drafted by humans that that weren't drafted by humans that we've trained on. as you get in non LLM we've trained on. as you get in non LLM based uh models, you may be totally based uh models, you may be totally right, but almost no one's really using right, but almost no one's really using nonlm based models at scale nonlm based models at scale &gt;&gt; on driving specifically. Travis is &gt;&gt; on driving specifically. Travis is totally right that humans are actually totally right that humans are actually really good drivers except when they get really good drivers except when they get distracted. They get distracted by drugs distracted. They get distracted by drugs or alcohol. They get distracted by being or alcohol. They get distracted by being tired. They get distracted by turning tired. They get distracted by turning the radio. They get distracted by the radio. They get distracted by chatting with their passenger. So chatting with their passenger. So trading against human behaviors actually trading against human behaviors actually turned out to be a great decision turned out to be a great decision because what for whatever sort of because what for whatever sort of Darwinistic reasons humans are pretty Darwinistic reasons humans are pretty ideal drivers and so you don't have to ideal drivers and so you don't have to reason from first principles this is a reason from first principles this is a much better path and I think again there much better path and I think again there may be a a broad u sort of lesson there. may be a a broad u sort of lesson there. most important thing I think as a VC most important thing I think as a VC that you said uh is we've been debating that you said uh is we've been debating for years should we invest in companies for years should we invest in companies like scale or mercore or any of these like scale or mercore or any of these surge the truth is I think there's a surge the truth is I think there's a very short halflife very short halflife on human label data and so everybody on human label data and so everybody who's investing in these companies just who's investing in these companies just looking at revenue traction looking at revenue traction really didn't understand that there may really didn't understand that there may be a year two years three years max when be a year two years three years max when anybody uses human label data for maybe anybody uses human label data for maybe anything anything anything &gt;&gt; because we hit the end of human &gt;&gt; because we hit the end of human knowledge or just the collection of it. knowledge or just the collection of it. 99% done 99% done 99% done &gt;&gt; or you train on it so well &gt;&gt; or you train on it so well that you don't need to label anymore. that you don't need to label anymore. Like the the machines know how to label Like the the machines know how to label as good or better than a human. And so as good or better than a human. And so like we're seeing this in the like we're seeing this in the self-driving space is labeling was huge, self-driving space is labeling was huge, right? You would have a right? You would have a three-dimensional sort of scene that's three-dimensional sort of scene that's created by video plus LAR. Let's say, created by video plus LAR. Let's say, okay, I have to label all of these okay, I have to label all of these essentially what become boxes like I've essentially what become boxes like I've identified objects. You're you're some identified objects. You're you're some of the players in the in the autonomous of the players in the in the autonomous software space, autonomous vehicle software space, autonomous vehicle software space are no longer doing any software space are no longer doing any labeling because the machines are doing labeling because the machines are doing it all. it all. it all. &gt;&gt; Just broadly, &gt;&gt; Just broadly, &gt;&gt; it'll just be built into the chipset &gt;&gt; it'll just be built into the chipset that this is a stop sign. Like it's like that this is a stop sign. Like it's like we know what a stop sign is. We don't we know what a stop sign is. We don't need the millionth time for somebody need the millionth time for somebody &gt;&gt; captas like you're like find the stop &gt;&gt; captas like you're like find the stop sign or what's the traffic light and sign or what's the traffic light and eventually the machines are just way eventually the machines are just way better than humans at identifying these better than humans at identifying these things things things &gt;&gt; or you to be very practical when you see &gt;&gt; or you to be very practical when you see a stop sign you don't have to identify a stop sign you don't have to identify that it's a stop sign. You just see that that it's a stop sign. You just see that every human when they encounter a stop every human when they encounter a stop sign 99.9% of the time they hit a break sign 99.9% of the time they hit a break and they never act. So nobody actually and they never act. So nobody actually knows it's a stop sign. It's just that knows it's a stop sign. It's just that hit a break when you see something that hit a break when you see something that looks like this object. looks like this object. &gt;&gt; It's just a vibe. &gt;&gt; It's just a vibe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a vibe. &gt;&gt; it's a vibe. &gt;&gt; I would just say that that's like &gt;&gt; I would just say that that's like intuitive knowledge versus like the intuitive knowledge versus like the expressly labeled human knowledge. The expressly labeled human knowledge. The question for me is if everybody was so question for me is if everybody was so reliant on human labeling initially, if reliant on human labeling initially, if you're an investor now, when you see you're an investor now, when you see these Gro four results, these Gro four results, how do you make an investment decision how do you make an investment decision that's not purely levered to just that's not purely levered to just computation? computation? computation? So if you look at these results, does it So if you look at these results, does it mean that the, you know, there's 300 to mean that the, you know, there's 300 to a,000 basis points of lag a,000 basis points of lag between just letting the computers vibe between just letting the computers vibe itself to the answer versus interjecting itself to the answer versus interjecting ourselves? If interjecting ourselves ourselves? If interjecting ourselves slows us down by 300 to a,000 basis slows us down by 300 to a,000 basis points per successive iteration, then points per successive iteration, then over two or three iterations, you've over two or three iterations, you've totally lost. So, what does it mean for totally lost. So, what does it mean for everybody that's not Grock when they everybody that's not Grock when they wake up today and they have to decide wake up today and they have to decide how do I change my strategy or double how do I change my strategy or double down? down? down? &gt;&gt; I think look, I'm I'm not in the &gt;&gt; I think look, I'm I'm not in the investment game, but if I were, it would investment game, but if I were, it would be all about scientific breakthrough. be all about scientific breakthrough. So, I sometimes get in this place where So, I sometimes get in this place where I'm looking I'm going down a path. I, I'm looking I'm going down a path. I, you know, I'll be up at 4:00 or 5 in the you know, I'll be up at 4:00 or 5 in the morning. Uh, my day hasn't quite morning. Uh, my day hasn't quite started, but I'm not sleeping anymore. started, but I'm not sleeping anymore. And I'll start go like I'll be on Kora And I'll start go like I'll be on Kora and see some cool quantum physics and see some cool quantum physics question or something else I'm looking question or something else I'm looking into and I'll go down this thread with into and I'll go down this thread with GPT or Grock and I'll start to get to GPT or Grock and I'll start to get to the edge of what's known in quantum the edge of what's known in quantum physics and then I'm doing the physics and then I'm doing the equivalent of vibe coding except it's equivalent of vibe coding except it's vibe physics vibe physics vibe physics and we're approaching what's known and and we're approaching what's known and I'm trying to poke and see if there's I'm trying to poke and see if there's breakthroughs to be had and I've gotten breakthroughs to be had and I've gotten pretty damn close to some interesting pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that. breakthroughs just doing that. &gt;&gt; And I, you know, I pinged uh I pinged &gt;&gt; And I, you know, I pinged uh I pinged Elon at some point. I'm just like, dude, Elon at some point. I'm just like, dude, if I'm if I'm doing this and I'm super if I'm if I'm doing this and I'm super amateur hour physics enthusiast like amateur hour physics enthusiast like what about all those PhD students and what about all those PhD students and postocs that are super legit using this postocs that are super legit using this tool and this is pre Grock 4 now with tool and this is pre Grock 4 now with Grock 4 like like there's a lot of Grock 4 like like there's a lot of mistakes. I was seeing Grock make that mistakes. I was seeing Grock make that then I would correct and we would talk then I would correct and we would talk about it. Grock could be this place about it. Grock could be this place where breakthroughs are actually where breakthroughs are actually happening, new breakthroughs. So if I'm happening, new breakthroughs. So if I'm investing in this space, I would be investing in this space, I would be like, like, like, &gt;&gt; who's got the edge on scientific &gt;&gt; who's got the edge on scientific breakthroughs and and the application breakthroughs and and the application layer on top of these foundational layer on top of these foundational models that orients that direction? Is models that orients that direction? Is your perception that the LLMs are your perception that the LLMs are actually starting to get to the actually starting to get to the reasoning level that they'll come up reasoning level that they'll come up with a novel concept theory and have with a novel concept theory and have that breakthrough or that we're kind of that breakthrough or that we're kind of reading into it and it's just trying reading into it and it's just trying random stuffs at the at the margins. random stuffs at the at the margins. &gt;&gt; It's uh &gt;&gt; It's uh &gt;&gt; or maybe it doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; or maybe it doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. So, what I what I've seen &gt;&gt; No, no, no. So, what I what I've seen and again I haven't used Grock for I and again I haven't used Grock for I tried to use it early this morning but tried to use it early this morning but for some reason I couldn't do it on my for some reason I couldn't do it on my on my app. But on my app. But so let's say we're talking Gro 3 and so let's say we're talking Gro 3 and existing chat GPT as it is. No, it existing chat GPT as it is. No, it cannot come up with the new idea. These cannot come up with the new idea. These things are so wedded to what is known things are so wedded to what is known &gt;&gt; and they're so like even when I come up &gt;&gt; and they're so like even when I come up with a new idea, I have to really it's with a new idea, I have to really it's like pulling a donkey sort of. You see, like pulling a donkey sort of. You see, you're pulling it you're pulling it &gt;&gt; because it doesn't want to break &gt;&gt; because it doesn't want to break conventional wisdom. It's like really conventional wisdom. It's like really adhering to conventional wisdom. for adhering to conventional wisdom. for pulling it out and then eventually goes, pulling it out and then eventually goes, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got something." "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got something." &gt;&gt; But then when it says that, when it says &gt;&gt; But then when it says that, then you you have to you have to that, then you you have to go, "Okay, it said that, but I'm not go, "Okay, it said that, but I'm not sure." Like you have to double and sure." Like you have to double and triple check to make sure that you triple check to make sure that you really got something. To your point, really got something. To your point, when these models are fully divorced when these models are fully divorced from having to learn on the known world from having to learn on the known world and instead can just learn and instead can just learn synthetically, synthetically, synthetically, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; then everything gets flipped upside down &gt;&gt; then everything gets flipped upside down to what is the best hypothesis you have to what is the best hypothesis you have or what is the best question? You could or what is the best question? You could just give it some problem and it would just give it some problem and it would just figure it out. just figure it out. &gt;&gt; So, where I go on this one, guys, is &gt;&gt; So, where I go on this one, guys, is it's all about scientific method, it's all about scientific method, right? If you get if you have an LLM or right? If you get if you have an LLM or foundational model of some kind that is foundational model of some kind that is the best in the world at the scientific the best in the world at the scientific method, method, method, game the f over. game the f over. You basically you just light up more You basically you just light up more GPUs and you just got like a thousand GPUs and you just got like a thousand more PhD students working for you. more PhD students working for you. &gt;&gt; Keith, you're nodding your head here. &gt;&gt; Keith, you're nodding your head here. &gt;&gt; I I agree with that. I think that's &gt;&gt; I I agree with that. I think that's fantastic because the scientific method fantastic because the scientific method also the faster it is the more you when also the faster it is the more you when you have a hypothesis the faster you get you have a hypothesis the faster you get a response you're more likely to dive in a response you're more likely to dive in and dive in recursively and and dive in and dive in recursively and recursively and every lag every recursively and every lag every millisecond lag causes you to like lose millisecond lag causes you to like lose your train of thought sort of so to your train of thought sort of so to speak. So you get the benefits that speak. So you get the benefits that Travis alluding to plus speed and you go Travis alluding to plus speed and you go places you never guess. This happens all places you never guess. This happens all the time when you run a company and the time when you run a company and you're doing like analytics and you have you're doing like analytics and you have a tool that allows you to constantly a tool that allows you to constantly query quickly quickly quickly double query quickly quickly quickly double click triple click you get to answers click triple click you get to answers that you never get to there's even a that you never get to there's even a second or two second or 3 second delay second or two second or 3 second delay let alone sending it to a human. let alone sending it to a human. Secondly where you actually see this Secondly where you actually see this today it's already happening. If you today it's already happening. If you look at foundational models that just look at foundational models that just apply to science, there's lots of things apply to science, there's lots of things about the human body, let's say in about the human body, let's say in health biology, that we humans don't health biology, that we humans don't actually understand all the connections. actually understand all the connections. Like why do we do X? Why do some people Like why do we do X? Why do some people get cancer? Why other people not get get cancer? Why other people not get cancer? Why does the brain work this cancer? Why does the brain work this way? Models trained solely on science way? Models trained solely on science tend to expose connections that no human tend to expose connections that no human has ever had before. has ever had before. &gt;&gt; And that's because like the raw &gt;&gt; And that's because like the raw materials there and we only have a materials there and we only have a conscious awareness of call it 110%. But conscious awareness of call it 110%. But when you apply it to other human domains when you apply it to other human domains where they're training on human sort of where they're training on human sort of data, human produced data, human data, human produced output, they're limited to that produced output, they're limited to that output. So I think you just take the output. So I think you just take the science and apply it at large and you science and apply it at large and you you're going to wind up finding things you're going to wind up finding things that no human has ever thought before. that no human has ever thought before. And it's that the thing about science And it's that the thing about science though is that it's the hypothesis that though is that it's the hypothesis that you then have to test in the physical you then have to test in the physical world. So the you're like okay you've world. So the you're like okay you've got this hive mind this like you know got this hive mind this like you know this this this computation engine this brain of sorts computation engine this brain of sorts &gt;&gt; you wanted to say consciousness but you &gt;&gt; you wanted to say consciousness but you start I was like how do I describe start I was like how do I describe &gt;&gt; the big C word consciousness &gt;&gt; the big C word consciousness &gt;&gt; but but you need to be able to test in &gt;&gt; but but you need to be able to test in the physical world so you could imagine the physical world so you could imagine a a physical lab connected to one of a a physical lab connected to one of these systems these systems these systems where then you could say, okay, like if where then you could say, okay, like if it was a chemistry experiment, you could it was a chemistry experiment, you could do chemistry experiments or physics. You do chemistry experiments or physics. You get the idea. get the idea. &gt;&gt; What could go wrong? &gt;&gt; What could go wrong? &gt;&gt; It would be it's yeah, no big deal. It's &gt;&gt; It would be it's yeah, no big deal. It's going to be fine. Okay. So, but but this going to be fine. Okay. So, but but this is where it goes because if you have a is where it goes because if you have a scientific method machine, you still scientific method machine, you still have to be able to test your hypothesis. have to be able to test your hypothesis. You have to go through the scientific You have to go through the scientific &gt;&gt; and the verification. Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; and the verification. Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's kind of mind-blowing. Reminds &gt;&gt; Wow. It's kind of mind-blowing. Reminds me me me &gt;&gt; really mindblowing &gt;&gt; really mindblowing &gt;&gt; if you remember I don't know if you guys &gt;&gt; if you remember I don't know if you guys remember dark matter and like the remember dark matter and like the discovery of it and everything and as discovery of it and everything and as explained to me by Lisa Randall you know explained to me by Lisa Randall you know the the discovery was made not by the the discovery was made not by knowing there was dark ma matter there knowing there was dark ma matter there and observing it but observing there was and observing it but observing there was something you know gravitational forces something you know gravitational forces around this other matter and then they around this other matter and then they said wait what's causing that and that's said wait what's causing that and that's why they found dark matter so these why they found dark matter so these ideas you know the idea that LLM could ideas you know the idea that LLM could actually do that actually do that &gt;&gt; come up with something so novel is it &gt;&gt; come up with something so novel is it doesn't it feels like we might be right doesn't it feels like we might be right there, right? Like we're kind of on the there, right? Like we're kind of on the cusp of it. cusp of it. &gt;&gt; One of the seven most difficult problems &gt;&gt; One of the seven most difficult problems in math or the most important problems in math or the most important problems in math is proving a general solution to in math is proving a general solution to this thing called Mavier Stokes, which this thing called Mavier Stokes, which is basically like viscous fluid dynamics is basically like viscous fluid dynamics and conservation of mass. We use it and conservation of mass. We use it every day in the design of everything. every day in the design of everything. You know what? It hasn't been proved. You know what? It hasn't been proved. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the craziest thing where &gt;&gt; Isn't that the craziest thing where you're just like, how is this even you're just like, how is this even possible? We use it to design airplanes, possible? We use it to design airplanes, to design everything. It hasn't been to design everything. It hasn't been proved. And so you could just point a proved. And so you could just point a computer at this thing and you would computer at this thing and you would unlock all these incredible mysteries of unlock all these incredible mysteries of the universe and we would probably find the universe and we would probably find completely different propulsion systems. completely different propulsion systems. We could probably do things that we We could probably do things that we didn't think were possible. didn't think were possible. Teleportation I mean who knows what's Teleportation I mean who knows what's possible. possible. possible. &gt;&gt; But remember remember you know how Elon &gt;&gt; But remember remember you know how Elon talks about Brock and and about AI talks about Brock and and about AI generally is about why are we here? What generally is about why are we here? What is the purpose? is the purpose? &gt;&gt; Meaning of the universe. Yeah. What is &gt;&gt; Meaning of the universe. Yeah. What is the meaning of the universe? How does it the meaning of the universe? How does it work? work? work? &gt;&gt; And a sort of fierce truth seeeking &gt;&gt; And a sort of fierce truth seeeking mechanism there. mechanism there. mechanism there. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question, Keith, &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question, Keith, Travis, Jason. If you guys were running Travis, Jason. If you guys were running Grock 4, Grock 4, Grock 4, &gt;&gt; that'd be so much fun. &gt;&gt; that'd be so much fun. &gt;&gt; How do you judo flip open AAI? Because &gt;&gt; How do you judo flip open AAI? Because they they they are marching steadfastly towards a are marching steadfastly towards a billion Mao, then a billion DAO. billion Mao, then a billion DAO. It's a juggernaut. So, how do you use It's a juggernaut. So, how do you use the better product in a moment to judo the better product in a moment to judo flip flip flip the less better product? the less better product? &gt;&gt; Look. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing, &gt;&gt; Look. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing, right? So, you do the Elon way. So you right? So, you do the Elon way. So you have you get a bunch of missionary like have you get a bunch of missionary like full-on missionary engineers that work full-on missionary engineers that work twice as hard and you have a culture twice as hard and you have a culture that is ultra fierce truth seeeking that is ultra fierce truth seeeking and you don't you don't get caught up in and you don't you don't get caught up in politics, bureaucracy, BS politics, bureaucracy, BS and you just you go for it and and I and you just you go for it and and I think you know that's where you know and think you know that's where you know and then you go wow scientific breakthrough then you go wow scientific breakthrough scientific method method like you start scientific method method like you start winning on truth and that will start I winning on truth and that will start I believe that will start to give the believe that will start to give the product awesomeness product awesomeness product awesomeness of open AI a run for its money of open AI a run for its money &gt;&gt; but like the product of open AI the &gt;&gt; but like the product of open AI the product department those guys are product department those guys are crushing crushing crushing &gt;&gt; they're really good they're not only &gt;&gt; they're really good they're not only ahead of the game but they feel like it ahead of the game but they feel like it just they're just leading in a lot of just they're just leading in a lot of different ways but if you are better at different ways but if you are better at truth you will eventually you'll truth you will eventually you'll eventually have an AI product manager. eventually have an AI product manager. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And on a technical basis too, &gt;&gt; Yeah. And on a technical basis too, people forget how good Elon is at people forget how good Elon is at factories and physical real world factories and physical real world things. things. things. &gt;&gt; Uh what he did standing up Colossus made &gt;&gt; Uh what he did standing up Colossus made like Jensen Juan was like how is this like Jensen Juan was like how is this possible that you did this right? So possible that you did this right? So pressing that his ability to build pressing that his ability to build factories and he said many times like factories and he said many times like the factory is the product of Tesla. the factory is the product of Tesla. It's not the cars that come out of the It's not the cars that come out of the factory or the batteries. It's the factory or the batteries. It's the factory itself. So if he can keep factory itself. So if he can keep solving the energy problem with solar on solving the energy problem with solar on one side and batteries and standing up, one side and batteries and standing up, you know, Colossus 2, three, four, five, you know, Colossus 2, three, four, five, he's going to have a massive advantage he's going to have a massive advantage there on top of Travis, you know, the there on top of Travis, you know, the missionary missionary missionary individuals, which by the way was what individuals, which by the way was what he backed before Sam Alman corrupted the he backed before Sam Alman corrupted the original missionary basis of OpenAI and original missionary basis of OpenAI and made it closed AI and a, made it closed AI and a, &gt;&gt; you know, this is nothing derogatory &gt;&gt; you know, this is nothing derogatory towards him, but he did hoodwink and towards him, but he did hoodwink and stab Elon in the It's not nothing stab Elon in the It's not nothing personal. I mean, he just screwed him personal. I mean, he just screwed him over. And over. And over. And &gt;&gt; would you say he bamboozled him? &gt;&gt; would you say he bamboozled him? &gt;&gt; He bamboozled him, screwed him, &gt;&gt; He bamboozled him, screwed him, hoodwinkedked him, you know, but pick hoodwinkedked him, you know, but pick your term here. But, uh, he did he your term here. But, uh, he did he didn't dirty. The original mission was didn't dirty. The original mission was to be missionary and open source all to be missionary and open source all this content. That's the other piece I this content. That's the other piece I think is a wild card. And I'll and then think is a wild card. And I'll and then I'll sing Keith's position, but I'll sing Keith's position, but &gt;&gt; open sourcing some of this could have &gt;&gt; open sourcing some of this could have profound ramifications. I think open profound ramifications. I think open sourcing the self-driving data could sourcing the self-driving data could have a really profound impact. have a really profound impact. Elon wanted to do something really Elon wanted to do something really disruptive like he open sourced his disruptive like he open sourced his patents for you know um charging. If he patents for you know um charging. If he opens source the data set and opens source the data set and self-driving does anybody have the self-driving does anybody have the ability to produce robo taxis at the ability to produce robo taxis at the scale he can do it? I don't think so. scale he can do it? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Travis's hypothesis is true then yeah &gt;&gt; Travis's hypothesis is true then yeah everybody will. Well, what? Sorry. everybody will. Well, what? Sorry. Everybody will what? Shiman, Everybody will what? Shiman, &gt;&gt; if you have access to the money that &gt;&gt; if you have access to the money that buys the compute, everyone could solve buys the compute, everyone could solve that problem. that problem. that problem. &gt;&gt; What's the hardware piece I'm talking &gt;&gt; What's the hardware piece I'm talking about? about? about? &gt;&gt; He said he said if he if he published &gt;&gt; He said he said if he if he published all the FSD data, could somebody build all the FSD data, could somebody build an autonomous vehicle? an autonomous vehicle? &gt;&gt; Well, yes, but could somebody produce a &gt;&gt; Well, yes, but could somebody produce a 100 million robo taxis from a factory 100 million robo taxis from a factory with batteries in them? with batteries in them? &gt;&gt; Okay. No, that's a diff that's a &gt;&gt; Okay. No, that's a diff that's a different question. different question. different question. &gt;&gt; That's the thing I'm saying. And not &gt;&gt; That's the thing I'm saying. And not really because last time I was a guest really because last time I was a guest on you know on we talked about vertical on you know on we talked about vertical integration. integration. integration. &gt;&gt; Uh products really require vertical &gt;&gt; Uh products really require vertical integration. So ultimately you have a integration. So ultimately you have a self-driving something that is self-driving something that is customuilt for knowing it's going to be customuilt for knowing it's going to be self-driving and it interacts self-driving and it interacts differently. The cost structure is differently. The cost structure is different. The controls are different. different. The controls are different. The seating's different. everything. You The seating's different. everything. You build a product taking advantage of build a product taking advantage of where in the stack you have the most where in the stack you have the most competitive advantage, but then you competitive advantage, but then you leverage that and it reinforces it's leverage that and it reinforces it's still why like Apple despite missing the still why like Apple despite missing the AI wave still a pretty good company from AI wave still a pretty good company from any empirical standpoint. I mean like any empirical standpoint. I mean like the performance is absolutely miserable the performance is absolutely miserable on the most important technology on the most important technology breakthrough of the last 70 years, but breakthrough of the last 70 years, but the company's still alive and still the company's still alive and still worth trillions of dollars because it's worth trillions of dollars because it's vertically integrated. Open AAI at your vertically integrated. Open AAI at your point, they do have a good product team point, they do have a good product team and they need to stay ahead on the and they need to stay ahead on the product level because they can't compete product level because they can't compete on the factory level. The way to stay on the factory level. The way to stay ahead on the product level is shipping a ahead on the product level is shipping a device. They got to ship the device. device. They got to ship the device. It's got to be good. It's got to be It's got to be good. It's got to be right. It's got to be the right form right. It's got to be the right form factor. It's got to do things for humans factor. It's got to do things for humans that are unexpected. But then if they do that are unexpected. But then if they do that, they're like Apple plus AI. that, they're like Apple plus AI. &gt;&gt; Chimath, what's the paper you were &gt;&gt; Chimath, what's the paper you were talking about before? What was the name talking about before? What was the name of it again? of it again? &gt;&gt; The bitter lesson. &gt;&gt; The bitter lesson. &gt;&gt; Yeah. could apply to autonomous driving &gt;&gt; Yeah. could apply to autonomous driving is right now it's still like hey how do is right now it's still like hey how do I drive like a human we talked about I drive like a human we talked about that but the leapfrog moment here could that but the leapfrog moment here could be like hey drive a car make sure it's be like hey drive a car make sure it's efficient don't hit anybody and just efficient don't hit anybody and just simulate that uh quadrillion times and simulate that uh quadrillion times and it's all good right but right now we're it's all good right but right now we're still trying to drive like humans still trying to drive like humans because we don't have enough data and because we don't have enough data and therefore can't do enough compute therefore can't do enough compute &gt;&gt; that's the global lesson by the way &gt;&gt; that's the global lesson by the way you're totally right conceptual you the you're totally right conceptual you the blog post is right. But that's only true blog post is right. But that's only true when you have enough data. And depending when you have enough data. And depending upon the use case, the level of data you upon the use case, the level of data you need may not be possible for years, need may not be possible for years, decades, and you may need to hack your decades, and you may need to hack your way there through human interactions. way there through human interactions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, physical world AI is lacking in &gt;&gt; Yeah, physical world AI is lacking in data and so you just try to approximate data and so you just try to approximate humans. humans. humans. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you guys have seen this. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you guys have seen this. In related news, OpenAI and uh In related news, OpenAI and uh Perplexity are going after the browser. Perplexity are going after the browser. Perplexity launch comet for their $200 a Perplexity launch comet for their $200 a month tier. I actually downloaded I'll month tier. I actually downloaded I'll show it to you in a second. But this is show it to you in a second. But this is um a really interesting category. It's um a really interesting category. It's something developers can do already and something developers can do already and they do it all the time, you know, but they do it all the time, you know, but having your browser uh connected to having your browser uh connected to agents let you do really interesting agents let you do really interesting things. I'll show you an example here things. I'll show you an example here that I just fired off while we're that I just fired off while we're talking. So, I just asked it, hey, give talking. So, I just asked it, hey, give me the best flights from um United me the best flights from um United Airlines and uh business class from New Airlines and uh business class from New York City, from San Francisco to New York City, from San Francisco to New York City. It does some searches, but York City. It does some searches, but what you see here is it's popped up a what you see here is it's popped up a browser window and it's actually doing browser window and it's actually doing that work and you can see the steps it's that work and you can see the steps it's using and then I can actually open that using and then I can actually open that browser window and watch it do that. browser window and watch it do that. This is just a screenshot of it and it This is just a screenshot of it and it will open multiple of these. So you will open multiple of these. So you could I was doing a search the other day could I was doing a search the other day saying like, "Hey, tell me all the saying like, "Hey, tell me all the autobiographies I haven't bought on autobiographies I haven't bought on Amazon. Put them into my, you know, Amazon. Put them into my, you know, shopping cart and summarize each of them shopping cart and summarize each of them cuz I like biographies and I like doing cuz I like biographies and I like doing it here." And when it did this last it here." And when it did this last time, it put my flight into time, it put my flight into like uh and I was logged in under my like uh and I was logged in under my account and it basically put it into my account and it basically put it into my account in the checkout. account in the checkout. So again, this isn't like if you're a So again, this isn't like if you're a developer, you do this all day long, but developer, you do this all day long, but this really seems to be a new product this really seems to be a new product category. I'm curious if you guys have category. I'm curious if you guys have played with it yet. And then what your played with it yet. And then what your thoughts are on having an agentic thoughts are on having an agentic browser like this available to you to be browser like this available to you to be doing these tasks doing these tasks in real time. You can also connect in real time. You can also connect obviously your Gmail, your calendar to obviously your Gmail, your calendar to it. So I did a a search, tell me every it. So I did a a search, tell me every restaurant I've been to and then put it restaurant I've been to and then put it by city. And then I was going to open my by city. And then I was going to open my open table and then pull that data as open table and then pull that data as well. What's interesting about this, well. What's interesting about this, Keith, and I know you're a product guy Keith, and I know you're a product guy and done a lot of product work. I'm and done a lot of product work. I'm curious your thoughts on it is you don't curious your thoughts on it is you don't have to do this in the cloud. You're have to do this in the cloud. You're authenticated already into a lot of your authenticated already into a lot of your accounts, nor do you have to worry about accounts, nor do you have to worry about being blocked by these services because being blocked by these services because it doesn't look like a scraper or a bot. it doesn't look like a scraper or a bot. It just it's your browser doing the It just it's your browser doing the work. Your thoughts on this? Have you work. Your thoughts on this? Have you played with it at Yep. I think it's a played with it at Yep. I think it's a great hail mary attempt by Perplexity. I great hail mary attempt by Perplexity. I think up since something like this, think up since something like this, perplexity is toast. Like for the stat perplexity is toast. Like for the stat about chat GBT is going to a billion about chat GBT is going to a billion users like it's becoming the verb, you users like it's becoming the verb, you know, that the way you describe using AI know, that the way you describe using AI for a normal consumer. There's nothing for a normal consumer. There's nothing left of perplexity if they can't pull left of perplexity if they can't pull this off. So, it's a great idea because this off. So, it's a great idea because like the history of like consumer like the history of like consumer technology companies is whoever's up has technology companies is whoever's up has uphill ground like in a military sense, uphill ground like in a military sense, whoever is first has a lot of control. whoever is first has a lot of control. This is actually what Google should be This is actually what Google should be doing truthfully like I think Google's doing truthfully like I think Google's also Google search qu search is toast also Google search qu search is toast and since they have Chrome and they and since they have Chrome and they theoretically have a quality team in theoretically have a quality team in Gemini they should be putting these two Gemini they should be putting these two things together and hoping to compete things together and hoping to compete with Chad GBT they're going to lose the with Chad GBT they're going to lose the search game like the assets that are search game like the assets that are best at Google right now have nothing to best at Google right now have nothing to do with search it's every other product do with search it's every other product is the only thing that's going to save is the only thing that's going to save that company if they can put figure out that company if they can put figure out how to use them how to use them &gt;&gt; Travis your thoughts on this category &gt;&gt; Travis your thoughts on this category anything come to mind for you in terms anything come to mind for you in terms of, of, of, you know, feature sets that would be you know, feature sets that would be extraordinary here? I know you you like extraordinary here? I know you you like to think about products and the consumer to think about products and the consumer experience. experience. experience. &gt;&gt; It's really interesting. So, you know, &gt;&gt; It's really interesting. So, you know, I've been spending, as you guys know, I've been spending, as you guys know, I've been spending my time on real I've been spending my time on real estate and construction and robotics. estate and construction and robotics. And so, I' I've been out of the this And so, I' I've been out of the this kind of consumer software game for a kind of consumer software game for a long time. But super interesting over long time. But super interesting over the last six months there have been a a the last six months there have been a a number of consumer software CEOs number of consumer software CEOs like when I hang out with them or like when I hang out with them or whatever they're like whatever they're like yo how are we going to how are we going yo how are we going to keep doing what we do when the agents to keep doing what we do when the agents take over. take over. take over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The paradigm shift is so profound &gt;&gt; Yeah. The paradigm shift is so profound that the idea that you would visit a web that the idea that you would visit a web page goes away and you're just in a chat page goes away and you're just in a chat &gt;&gt; dial you have an agent that's just &gt;&gt; dial you have an agent that's just taking care of your flights for you. So, taking care of your flights for you. So, I I kind of I I think there's a leaprog I I kind of I I think there's a leaprog over that. I think over that. I think it's just like you tell something, yo, I it's just like you tell something, yo, I want to go to New York. Can you you want to go to New York. Can you you know, I'm sort of looking at this time know, I'm sort of looking at this time range. Can you just go find something range. Can you just go find something I'm probably going to like and give me a I'm probably going to like and give me a couple options? couple options? couple options? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's just a whole you have an &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's just a whole you have an interface and then you know is perplex interface and then you know is perplex is this thing that you just showed is this thing that you just showed perplexely is that the interface or do I perplexely is that the interface or do I just have an agent that just goes and just have an agent that just goes and does everything for me and is this the does everything for me and is this the start of that? I you know I just haven't start of that? I you know I just haven't spent enough time. I I do know that spent enough time. I I do know that every consumer every consumer every consumer software CEO software CEO software CEO that has an app in the app store is that has an app in the app store is tripping. They're tripping right now. tripping. They're tripping right now. &gt;&gt; And I mean big boys. I meet guys with &gt;&gt; And I mean big boys. I meet guys with real stuff and sometimes I I'm doing real stuff and sometimes I I'm doing like almost like therapy sessions with like almost like therapy sessions with them. I'm like, "It's going to be fine. them. I'm like, "It's going to be fine. You actually you actually have stuff. You actually you actually have stuff. You have a mo. You have real stuff You have a mo. You have real stuff that's of value. They can't replace it that's of value. They can't replace it with an agent." with an agent." &gt;&gt; And they're like, &gt;&gt; And they're like, &gt;&gt; "So, you're lying to them. You're doing &gt;&gt; "So, you're lying to them. You're doing hospice care and you're telling them hospice care and you're telling them everything's going to be okay, but the everything's going to be okay, but the patient patient patient options on Robin Hood while he's like, options on Robin Hood while he's like, "Yeah, yeah, tell me more. Tell me "Yeah, yeah, tell me more. Tell me more." more." more." &gt;&gt; All these things. &gt;&gt; All these things. &gt;&gt; There's certain things that are &gt;&gt; There's certain things that are protected and there's certain things protected and there's certain things that aren't. That's all. that aren't. That's all. &gt;&gt; Well, let's talk about that because the &gt;&gt; Well, let's talk about that because the you and I are old enough to remember uh you and I are old enough to remember uh general magic. This vision was out there general magic. This vision was out there a long time ago with personal digital a long time ago with personal digital assistance and you would just talk to an assistance and you would just talk to an agent. It would go do this for you. This agent. It would go do this for you. This feels like a step to that where it does feels like a step to that where it does all the work for you, presents you the all the work for you, presents you the final moment and says approve. final moment and says approve. &gt;&gt; Like a concierge or a butler. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Like a concierge or a butler. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think what you're describing is what &gt;&gt; I think what you're describing is what we want. But I think more specifically we want. But I think more specifically for today, Keith and Travis totally nail for today, Keith and Travis totally nail it. Look, I think building a browser is it. Look, I think building a browser is an absolutely stupid capital allocation an absolutely stupid capital allocation decision. Just totally stupid and decision. Just totally stupid and unjustifiable in 2025. Specifically for unjustifiable in 2025. Specifically for Perplexity, Perplexity, Perplexity, I think their path to building a legacy I think their path to building a legacy business is to replace Bloomberg. business is to replace Bloomberg. Everything that they've done in Everything that they've done in financial information and financial data financial information and financial data in going beyond the model has been in going beyond the model has been excellent. As somebody who's paid excellent. As somebody who's paid $25,000 to Bloomberg for many years, $25,000 to Bloomberg for many years, the terminal is atrocious. It's the terminal is atrocious. It's terrible. It's not very good. It's very terrible. It's not very good. It's very limited. limited. limited. and anybody that could build a better and anybody that could build a better product would take over a hundred product would take over a hundred billion dollar enterprise because I billion dollar enterprise because I think it's there for the taking. I wish think it's there for the taking. I wish that Perplexity would double and triple that Perplexity would double and triple down on that. And so when you see this down on that. And so when you see this kind of kind of kind of &gt;&gt; random sprawl, &gt;&gt; random sprawl, &gt;&gt; let's do it, Jimoth. Let's just go do &gt;&gt; let's do it, Jimoth. Let's just go do it. it. it. &gt;&gt; When you do the random sprawl, I think &gt;&gt; When you do the random sprawl, I think it doesn't work. But I just want to say it doesn't work. But I just want to say like a browser is like the dumbest thing like a browser is like the dumbest thing to build in 2025 because in a world of to build in 2025 because in a world of agents, what is a browser? It's a agents, what is a browser? It's a glorified markup reader. It's like glorified markup reader. It's like handling HTML. It's handling CSS and handling HTML. It's handling CSS and JavaScript. It's doing some networking. JavaScript. It's doing some networking. It's doing some security. It's doing It's doing some security. It's doing some rendering. But it's like this is some rendering. But it's like this is all under the water type stuff. I get it all under the water type stuff. I get it that we had to deal with all that that we had to deal with all that nonsense in nonsense in nonsense in 1998 1998 1998 to try LOS or Google for the first time. to try LOS or Google for the first time. But in 2025, But in 2025, there's something that you just speak to there's something that you just speak to and eventually there's probably and eventually there's probably something that's in your brain which you something that's in your brain which you just think and it just doesn't. You're just think and it just doesn't. You're thinking thinking thinking I need a flight to JFK or at the maximum I need a flight to JFK or at the maximum today in a very elegant beautiful search today in a very elegant beautiful search bar you type in get me a flight and it bar you type in get me a flight and it already knows what to do. Keith, in some already knows what to do. Keith, in some ways this is a step towards that ways this is a step towards that ultimate vision. So you'd think it's ultimate vision. So you'd think it's worth it to you know sort of perplexity worth it to you know sort of perplexity to make this way point perhaps if you to make this way point perhaps if you look at it as a waypoint between the look at it as a waypoint between the ultimate vision which is a command line ultimate vision which is a command line and earpiece. and earpiece. and earpiece. &gt;&gt; How do you get distribution Jason for &gt;&gt; How do you get distribution Jason for the 19th web browser in 2025? Well, the 19th web browser in 2025? Well, yeah, that is a challenge and I think yeah, that is a challenge and I think most people are speculating Apple, which most people are speculating Apple, which has a lot of users, might buy Perplexity has a lot of users, might buy Perplexity or do a deal with Perplexity and give or do a deal with Perplexity and give them that distribution because of the them that distribution because of the Justice Department case against Google. Justice Department case against Google. So, there's been a lot of speculation So, there's been a lot of speculation about that. But Keith, what do you about that. But Keith, what do you think? think? think? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think they'd buy anything &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think they'd buy anything worth it. Like, what do what is Apple worth it. Like, what do what is Apple going to get if you continue this failed going to get if you continue this failed strategy of Apple, strategy of Apple, &gt;&gt; right? Apple has missed every possible &gt;&gt; right? Apple has missed every possible window on AI and continues to miss it window on AI and continues to miss it and it has cultural I think the CEO has and it has cultural I think the CEO has challenges I think culturally they have challenges I think culturally they have challenges I think they have challenges I think they have infrastructure challenges so it's it's infrastructure challenges so it's it's not an easy fix but buying perplexity is not an easy fix but buying perplexity is not going to help like strategy is not going to help like strategy is actually pretty coherent one for actually pretty coherent one for perplexity qu perplexity uh so I think perplexity qu perplexity uh so I think that it's not that it's not &gt;&gt; pick a vertical and own it strategy &gt;&gt; pick a vertical and own it strategy &gt;&gt; not not a bad idea um especially because &gt;&gt; not not a bad idea um especially because you need unique data sources some of you need unique data sources some of those data sources may or may not those data sources may or may not license their data to open AI. So, you license their data to open AI. So, you can do some clever things there, but um can do some clever things there, but um I don't think there's any residual value I don't think there's any residual value that Apple would get out of perplexity that Apple would get out of perplexity except there's some product taste, but except there's some product taste, but what are you going to spend like a what are you going to spend like a billion dollars for product taste? I billion dollars for product taste? I mean, Mark's spending hundreds of mean, Mark's spending hundreds of millions of dollar, hundreds of billions millions of dollar, hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever he's spending of dollars or whatever he's spending these days. And you know, Grock, if these days. And you know, Grock, if anything, Grock for shows that Mark anything, Grock for shows that Mark really doesn't need to just spend money really doesn't need to just spend money to build a whole new team because to build a whole new team because everything they've done in AI has also everything they've done in AI has also missed the boat. Well, I mean, Keith, missed the boat. Well, I mean, Keith, the way you phrase it there almost makes the way you phrase it there almost makes it worth it for Apple to throw a Hail it worth it for Apple to throw a Hail Mary, have a team with some taste Mary, have a team with some taste because that's how they tend to do because that's how they tend to do things is something that is elegant. And things is something that is elegant. And why not just throw your search to it, why not just throw your search to it, throw 10 billion at throw 10 billion at a bunch of what's elegant would be if a bunch of what's elegant would be if there's a bunch of agents and just a there's a bunch of agents and just a chat box. chat box. chat box. &gt;&gt; Seeing a bunch of visual diarrhea is not &gt;&gt; Seeing a bunch of visual diarrhea is not elegant. elegant. elegant. &gt;&gt; It's lazy. &gt;&gt; It's lazy. &gt;&gt; On our on our little Bloomberg clone, &gt;&gt; On our on our little Bloomberg clone, I'll give you naming rights. So you can I'll give you naming rights. So you can call it that. call it that. &gt;&gt; You like you like poly polyhapatia. So &gt;&gt; You like you like poly polyhapatia. So hey, can somebody can somebody uh bring hey, can somebody can somebody uh bring up the polyhapatia? up the polyhapatia? &gt;&gt; You know what's so funny? &gt;&gt; You know what's so funny? &gt;&gt; Rolls right off your tongue. &gt;&gt; Rolls right off your tongue. &gt;&gt; TK, listen. We were trying to do a &gt;&gt; TK, listen. We were trying to do a screen screen screen of companies and it maxes out at five of companies and it maxes out at five companies on a specific type of screen companies on a specific type of screen where you're like you're trying to where you're like you're trying to compare stock price to EBID and you're compare stock price to EBID and you're like, okay, I can only choose five, I like, okay, I can only choose five, I guess. So which five should I choose? guess. So which five should I choose? Lefont was on right like two episodes Lefont was on right like two episodes ago. He was like I can't pull this up. ago. He was like I can't pull this up. It's limited to six companies. It's limited to six companies. &gt;&gt; Dude, you it's So what do people use &gt;&gt; Dude, you it's So what do people use Bloomberg? Bloomberg? Bloomberg? &gt;&gt; They use it for the messaging. Now like &gt;&gt; They use it for the messaging. Now like my team has traded huge positions via my team has traded huge positions via text message on Bloomberg. So there is text message on Bloomberg. So there is something very valuable there. something very valuable there. &gt;&gt; But the core usability and the core UI &gt;&gt; But the core usability and the core UI of that company has not evolved. of that company has not evolved. &gt;&gt; I have my contribution &gt;&gt; I have my contribution &gt;&gt; and Plexity is very good at that by the &gt;&gt; and Plexity is very good at that by the way. It they they do a very good job. way. It they they do a very good job. &gt;&gt; I got a new domain name Travis. Let this &gt;&gt; I got a new domain name Travis. Let this one just sink in here. This is my way to one just sink in here. This is my way to weasle my way into the deal. weasle my way into the deal. &gt;&gt; begin.com. &gt;&gt; begin.com. &gt;&gt; begin.com. &gt;&gt; Begin.com. &gt;&gt; Begin.com. &gt;&gt; Begin.com. &gt;&gt; You own that, don't you? &gt;&gt; You own that, don't you? &gt;&gt; I do. I'm just a little I sniped some &gt;&gt; I do. I'm just a little I sniped some good ones once in a while. I got good ones once in a while. I got begin.com and I got annotated.com. Those begin.com and I got annotated.com. Those are my two little domains. are my two little domains. &gt;&gt; You're like You're like one of these old &gt;&gt; You're like You're like one of these old people that show up at those show and people that show up at those show and then then then show and you're like, "Oh, I have this show and you're like, "Oh, I have this thing that I bought 1845." thing that I bought 1845." &gt;&gt; Guys, Jason Jason is Jason is the daddy &gt;&gt; Guys, Jason Jason is Jason is the daddy and GoDaddy. Okay. I'm your dad. I'm and GoDaddy. Okay. I'm your dad. I'm your daddy. your daddy. your daddy. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. &gt;&gt; Who's your daddy? Hey, speaking of &gt;&gt; Who's your daddy? Hey, speaking of daddy. daddy. daddy. &gt;&gt; Let's go on to our next story. &gt;&gt; Let's go on to our next story. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Is now the right time for a third party? &gt;&gt; Is now the right time for a third party? Elon seems to think so. Last week, he Elon seems to think so. Last week, he announced that AXI would be creating a a announced that AXI would be creating a a new political party. I'll let you decide new political party. I'll let you decide who daddy is in this one. uh he said who daddy is in this one. uh he said quote when it comes to bankrupting our quote when it comes to bankrupting our country with waste and graft we live in country with waste and graft we live in a one party system not a democracy he's a one party system not a democracy he's not yet outlined a uh a platform for the not yet outlined a uh a platform for the American party we talked about it here American party we talked about it here last week I listed four core values last week I listed four core values which seem to get a good reaction on X which seem to get a good reaction on X fiscal responsibility doge sustainable fiscal responsibility doge sustainable energy and dominance in that energy and dominance in that manufacturing in the US which Elon has manufacturing in the US which Elon has done uh single-handedly here pronatalism done uh single-handedly here pronatalism which I think is a passion project for which I think is a passion project for him and Shabbath you punched it out with him and Shabbath you punched it out with the fifth technological excellence the fifth technological excellence according to poly market 55% chance that according to poly market 55% chance that Elon registers the American party by the Elon registers the American party by the end of the year and you know one thing I end of the year and you know one thing I was trying to figure out is just how was trying to figure out is just how unpopular are these candidates unpopular are these candidates and uh these political parties this is a and uh these political parties this is a very interesting chart that I think we very interesting chart that I think we could have a a great conversation around could have a a great conversation around it turns out we used to love our it turns out we used to love our presidents if you look here from Kennedy presidents if you look here from Kennedy at 83% % his highest approval rating. at 83% % his highest approval rating. His lowest was 56%. His lowest was 56%. That was his lowest approval rating. So That was his lowest approval rating. So he operated in a very high band. Look at he operated in a very high band. Look at Bush 2 during after 9/11. 92% was his Bush 2 during after 9/11. 92% was his peak. His lowest was 19, right? Wartime peak. His lowest was 19, right? Wartime president. But then you get to Trump president. But then you get to Trump one, Biden, and Trump 2. Historically one, Biden, and Trump 2. Historically low high approval. Their high watermark. low high approval. Their high watermark. 49 for Trump one, 63 for Biden, one of 49 for Trump one, 63 for Biden, one of one. and then 47 for Trump too and their one. and then 47 for Trump too and their lowest 29 3140. So maybe it is time for lowest 29 3140. So maybe it is time for a third party candidate. Let's discuss a third party candidate. Let's discuss it boys. it boys. it boys. &gt;&gt; I have no idea how to read this graph. I &gt;&gt; I have no idea how to read this graph. I have zero idea the worst. have zero idea the worst. &gt;&gt; I'm like what is happening here? &gt;&gt; I'm like what is happening here? &gt;&gt; This is the worst formatted chart. This &gt;&gt; This is the worst formatted chart. This is a confusing chart. But well, the is a confusing chart. But well, the reason I'm putting it up is for debate. reason I'm putting it up is for debate. So you should be saying thank you. So you should be saying thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're debating that it's creating &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're debating that it's creating debating. Why did you put it up? Here's debating. Why did you put it up? Here's another one. Gallup pole. Americans another one. Gallup pole. Americans desire for a viable third party. 63% in desire for a viable third party. 63% in 2023. So, it's it's bumping along an 2023. So, it's it's bumping along an alltime high. alltime high. alltime high. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm really concentrating on this &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm really concentrating on this one. one. one. &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway, I'm going to stop there. &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway, I'm going to stop there. &gt;&gt; What's the gray? &gt;&gt; What's the gray? &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Got &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Got &gt;&gt; the different presents during that time &gt;&gt; the different presents during that time period and how popular parties were. period and how popular parties were. Let's stop here. This is a good This is Let's stop here. This is a good place to stop. a good place to stop. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A couple points. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A couple points. &gt;&gt; Yes. The idea of Elon creating a third &gt;&gt; Yes. The idea of Elon creating a third party is for any other human being like party is for any other human being like absolutely absurd and ridiculous. Elon absolutely absurd and ridiculous. Elon has obviously done incredible things. So has obviously done incredible things. So dismissing anything he's touching is a dismissing anything he's touching is a bad idea. However, I think the best bad idea. However, I think the best metaphor I've seen is it's a little bit metaphor I've seen is it's a little bit like Michael Jordan tried to play like Michael Jordan tried to play baseball baseball baseball &gt;&gt; and he became a replacement level &gt;&gt; and he became a replacement level baseball player, which actually really baseball player, which actually really hard to do. By the way, Elon is probably hard to do. By the way, Elon is probably a replacement level politician. Um, he's a replacement level politician. Um, he's Michael Jordan for entrepreneurial Michael Jordan for entrepreneurial stuff, but the third party stuff is not stuff, but the third party stuff is not going to work. First of all, um there going to work. First of all, um there that chart is misleading. It's a flaw of that chart is misleading. It's a flaw of average. Well, it's both badly designed average. Well, it's both badly designed and it's a flaw of average politics. and it's a flaw of average politics. Trump is incredibly popular among Trump is incredibly popular among Republicans. He actually has the highest Republicans. He actually has the highest approval rate of any Republican ever approval rate of any Republican ever measured in recorded history. It's 95%. measured in recorded history. It's 95%. Reagan was peaked out at 93%. It's just Reagan was peaked out at 93%. It's just Democrats don't like him, which is Democrats don't like him, which is perfectly fine. Being polarizing is is perfectly fine. Being polarizing is is an ingredient to being successful, an ingredient to being successful, including with people on the show. Like including with people on the show. Like the point of accomplishing things in the the point of accomplishing things in the world is you don't really care what half world is you don't really care what half the world thinks. You need to make sure the world thinks. You need to make sure that there's a lot of people who like that there's a lot of people who like you and really approve and are you and really approve and are enthusiastic about what you do. And enthusiastic about what you do. And Trump is about as popular with his party Trump is about as popular with his party as anybody's ever been ever. Period. as anybody's ever been ever. Period. &gt;&gt; No exceptions. Secondly, um there's MAGA &gt;&gt; No exceptions. Secondly, um there's MAGA has kind of already uh changed the has kind of already uh changed the Republican party. Trump is sort of like Republican party. Trump is sort of like a third party takeover of the Republican a third party takeover of the Republican party. And so it's kind of already party. And so it's kind of already happened and maybe you can do this every happened and maybe you can do this every 20 years or 30 years. I don't think you 20 years or 30 years. I don't think you can have like this kind of can have like this kind of transformation on one party within a two transformation on one party within a two compressed period of time for a lot of compressed period of time for a lot of reasons. Third is um really smart reasons. Third is um really smart parties absorb the lesson of political parties absorb the lesson of political science. Unfortunately I studied science. Unfortunately I studied political science. I wasted kind of my political science. I wasted kind of my college years and instead of saying CS college years and instead of saying CS and you know maybe then I'd be coding and you know maybe then I'd be coding stuff and doing physics like Travis. But stuff and doing physics like Travis. But one thing I did learn is smart parties one thing I did learn is smart parties absorb the best ideas of third parties. absorb the best ideas of third parties. So the oxygen is usually not there So the oxygen is usually not there because there's a Darwinistic evolution because there's a Darwinistic evolution of if you get traction on an idea, it's of if you get traction on an idea, it's really easy to conscript some of those really easy to conscript some of those ideas and take away the momentum. No ideas and take away the momentum. No third party candidate that's a true like third party candidate that's a true like third party has won a Senate seat since third party has won a Senate seat since 1970. 1970. 1970. &gt;&gt; And that's actually Bill Buckley's &gt;&gt; And that's actually Bill Buckley's brother. So he had some name ID. The brother. So he had some name ID. The other thing Elon I think is missing and other thing Elon I think is missing and the proponents of what he's doing is the proponents of what he's doing is people vote not just for ideas, they people vote not just for ideas, they vote for people. It's a combination. The vote for people. It's a combination. The product is what do you what do you product is what do you believe and who are you? And you can't believe and who are you? And you can't divorce the two. Trump is a person and divorce the two. Trump is a person and that generates a lot of enthusiasm and that generates a lot of enthusiasm and it's one of the reasons why he has it's one of the reasons why he has challenges in midterms because he's not challenges in midterms because he's not on the ballot. His ideas may be on the on the ballot. His ideas may be on the ballot but he is not specifically on the ballot but he is not specifically on the ballot. So unless because Elon can't be ballot. So unless because Elon can't be the figure head of the party, he the figure head of the party, he literally can't constitutionally. literally can't constitutionally. You need a face that's a person, Obama, You need a face that's a person, Obama, a Clinton, like there's reasons why a Clinton, like there's reasons why people resonate. people resonate. people resonate. &gt;&gt; Reagan &gt;&gt; Reagan &gt;&gt; Reagan without that personality. Specific ideas without that personality. Specific ideas just are not going to galvanize the just are not going to galvanize the American people. American people. American people. &gt;&gt; Okay. So the counter to that and what &gt;&gt; Okay. So the counter to that and what people believe he's going to try to do people believe he's going to try to do is win a couple of seats in the House, is win a couple of seats in the House, Travis. win maybe one or two Senate Travis. win maybe one or two Senate seats if you were to do that. Those seats if you were to do that. Those things are pretty affordable to back. things are pretty affordable to back. Couple of million dollars for a House Couple of million dollars for a House race. Senate maybe$25 million. If Elon race. Senate maybe$25 million. If Elon puts, I don't know 250 million to work puts, I don't know 250 million to work every two years, which he I think he put every two years, which he I think he put 280 million to work on the last one. He 280 million to work on the last one. He could kind of create the Joe Mansion could kind of create the Joe Mansion moment and uh he could build a caucus, a moment and uh he could build a caucus, a platform. platform. platform. Grover Norquist kind of pledge along Grover Norquist kind of pledge along these lines. So, what do you think of these lines. So, what do you think of that? If he's not gonna create a viable that? If he's not gonna create a viable third party presidential candidate, third party presidential candidate, could he Travis pick off a couple of could he Travis pick off a couple of Senate seats, pick off a couple of Senate seats, pick off a couple of congressional seats? congressional seats? congressional seats? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, first I have this axiom that &gt;&gt; Okay. So, first I have this axiom that I'm making up right now. I'm making up right now. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's called Elon is almost always &gt;&gt; Okay. It's called Elon is almost always right. right. right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; Elon was right about everything. &gt;&gt; Elon was right about everything. &gt;&gt; Seriously, let's just be real. And like &gt;&gt; Seriously, let's just be real. And like honestly the things he's upset about and honestly the things he's upset about and that he's riled up about especially when that he's riled up about especially when you look at the deficit like man I am you look at the deficit like man I am right on board that train. Part one. right on board that train. Part one. Part two. Part two. Part two. We've never had somebody with this kind We've never had somebody with this kind of capital that can be a quote unquote of capital that can be a quote unquote party boss outside of the system. Right. party boss outside of the system. Right. And And And there's a lot of people that agree with there's a lot of people that agree with the types of things he's saying and he the types of things he's saying and he knows how to draw, you know, he Elon in knows how to draw, you know, he Elon in his own right kind of has a populous his own right kind of has a populous vibe like he does his thing and he's vibe like he does his thing and he's turned X into what it is and he's he's a turned X into what it is and he's he's a big part of X. And so I think it's the I big part of X. And so I think it's the I think it's great and honestly there's think it's great and honestly there's there's the moves you can make on Senate there's the moves you can make on Senate and House and just having a few folks and House and just having a few folks and then being you being levers then to and then being you being levers then to get the things you want done. That's get the things you want done. That's part one. And then part two of that is part one. And then part two of that is the threat of that happening can make the threat of that happening can make good things happen separately even if it good things happen separately even if it doesn't go all the way. doesn't go all the way. &gt;&gt; I just love it. I'm I'm on the train. &gt;&gt; I just love it. I'm I'm on the train. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm I'm in love with this role &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm I'm in love with this role for Elon more than picking a party for Elon more than picking a party because he's picking a very specific because he's picking a very specific platform that I think resonates with platform that I think resonates with folks which is just balance the budget. folks which is just balance the budget. Don't put us in so much debt and let's Don't put us in so much debt and let's have some sustainable energy, you know, have some sustainable energy, you know, job done. Great job. job done. Great job. &gt;&gt; The problem with that is like he's &gt;&gt; The problem with that is like he's actually wrong about the reason why we actually wrong about the reason why we have a deficit or debt. have a deficit or debt. &gt;&gt; It's not because we're undertaxed. It's &gt;&gt; It's not because we're undertaxed. It's we're massively overspending. If we just we're massively overspending. If we just &gt;&gt; No, I think he believes we're &gt;&gt; No, I think he believes we're overspending. They should have been overspending. They should have been supporting the last, you know, beautiful supporting the last, you know, beautiful bill because if you just held federal bill because if you just held federal spending to 2019 levels, so 2019 is not spending to 2019 levels, so 2019 is not like, you know, decades ago, like, you know, decades ago, &gt;&gt; literally with our current tax revenues, &gt;&gt; literally with our current tax revenues, we would be in a surplus, we would be in a surplus, &gt;&gt; 500 billion. &gt;&gt; 500 billion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there all we need to do is cut &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there all we need to do is cut spending. Now I admit that spending. Now I admit that &gt;&gt; why didn't that happen with the big &gt;&gt; why didn't that happen with the big beautiful bill? beautiful bill? beautiful bill? &gt;&gt; So this is where details do matter. I &gt;&gt; So this is where details do matter. I think there is a willingness and a you think there is a willingness and a you know discipline problem on both parties know discipline problem on both parties and I think maybe he can help fix that. and I think maybe he can help fix that. The second thing is that we have these The second thing is that we have these arcane rules particularly in the Senate arcane rules particularly in the Senate that you need 60 votes in many ways to that you need 60 votes in many ways to cut things except through very hacky cut things except through very hacky methods and that's a reality. So the methods and that's a reality. So the best thing truthfully he could do is best thing truthfully he could do is help get a Republican party to 60 votes help get a Republican party to 60 votes and then in then in theory he could be and then in then in theory he could be absolutely furious if you didn't cut absolutely furious if you didn't cut back to 2019 levels. But it it's very back to 2019 levels. But it it's very tricky. Or you can just overrule like tricky. Or you can just overrule like this. The filibuster is an artifact of this. The filibuster is an artifact of history and at some point some majority history and at some point some majority leader is just going to say we're done leader is just going to say we're done with the filibuster and just steamroll with the filibuster and just steamroll through all the cuts at 50 or 51 votes through all the cuts at 50 or 51 votes which you can do. There's no which you can do. There's no constitutional right to a filibuster. It constitutional right to a filibuster. It is an artifact of centuries of American is an artifact of centuries of American history and at some point it's going to history and at some point it's going to go away. So maybe the time is now. Maybe go away. So maybe the time is now. Maybe we should just fix everything now. we should just fix everything now. &gt;&gt; I think you're exactly right. I think &gt;&gt; I think you're exactly right. I think that the filibuster it's just a matter that the filibuster it's just a matter of time. I think it's on borrowed time. of time. I think it's on borrowed time. And I think in a world where it is on And I think in a world where it is on borrowed time, Jason, I think your path borrowed time, Jason, I think your path is probably the one that gives the is probably the one that gives the American party, if it does come into American party, if it does come into existence, the most leverage, which is existence, the most leverage, which is if you control three to five independent if you control three to five independent candidates, you gain substantial candidates, you gain substantial leverage. I just want to take a step leverage. I just want to take a step back and just note something. I don't back and just note something. I don't know if you guys know this, but the only know if you guys know this, but the only reason we're even having this reason we're even having this conversation or this is even possible is conversation or this is even possible is because in 2023, because in 2023, the FEC, Federal Elections Commission, the FEC, Federal Elections Commission, they actually released guidance and they they actually released guidance and they changed a bunch of rules. And the big changed a bunch of rules. And the big change that they made then was it change that they made then was it allowed super PACs to do a lot more than allowed super PACs to do a lot more than just run ads. Up until that point, all just run ads. Up until that point, all you could do if you were a super PAC is you could do if you were a super PAC is just basically run advertising, just basically run advertising, television, and radio, television, and radio, I guess, online as well. But what they I guess, online as well. But what they were allowed to do starting in 23 was were allowed to do starting in 23 was they were allowed to fund ground they were allowed to fund ground operations. They were allowed to do operations. They were allowed to do things like door knocking, phone things like door knocking, phone banking, you know, get out the vote. So, banking, you know, get out the vote. So, in other words, what happened was a in other words, what happened was a super PAC became more like a full super PAC became more like a full campaign machine. And Trump showed the campaign machine. And Trump showed the blueprint of using a super PAC, blueprint of using a super PAC, specifically his, to win the specifically his, to win the presidential election. presidential election. presidential election. So he was able to fund this massive So he was able to fund this massive ground game. He built infrastructure ground game. He built infrastructure across the swing states. He was across the swing states. He was obviously incredibly effective. And now obviously incredibly effective. And now that playbook can actually be used by that playbook can actually be used by other folks. And so to the extent that other folks. And so to the extent that Elon decides to use those changed FEC Elon decides to use those changed FEC rules, Jason, I think what you said is rules, Jason, I think what you said is the only path. But but I just I I just the only path. But but I just I I just wanted to double click on Keith's point wanted to double click on Keith's point because it's so important. I do think because it's so important. I do think the filibuster is going to go away and the filibuster is going to go away and it is because the the arceness of these it is because the the arceness of these rules having to do a reconciliation bill rules having to do a reconciliation bill and you know needing a supermajority and you know needing a supermajority veto proof supermajority in and the veto proof supermajority in and the other case it just means that nothing other case it just means that nothing gets done and I think somebody will gets done and I think somebody will eventually get impatient and just eventually get impatient and just steamroll this thing. We've never had so steamroll this thing. We've never had so many people say they feel politically many people say they feel politically homeless as we did the last two cycles. homeless as we did the last two cycles. And that includes many people on this And that includes many people on this podcast, people in our friend circle. podcast, people in our friend circle. And I think just the idea that Elon And I think just the idea that Elon could create a platform that people could create a platform that people could opt into and support, just the could opt into and support, just the existence of that would make the other existence of that would make the other two parties get their act together. two parties get their act together. &gt;&gt; By the way, I think that's what we need &gt;&gt; By the way, I think that's what we need is a little bit of a stick there and a is a little bit of a stick there and a carrot. Hey, if you don't control carrot. Hey, if you don't control spending, there's this third option. And spending, there's this third option. And if Travis and I are in it, and Keith, I if Travis and I are in it, and Keith, I know you'll never leave the Republican know you'll never leave the Republican party, but Shimoth, you know, you're party, but Shimoth, you know, you're probably set where you're where you want probably set where you're where you want to be right now. But I can tell you, we to be right now. But I can tell you, we go through our top 10 20 list, go through our top 10 20 list, &gt;&gt; out of those 50% will join Elon's party. &gt;&gt; out of those 50% will join Elon's party. Well, look, the other the other thing, Well, look, the other the other thing, Jason, that that Keith said, which I Jason, that that Keith said, which I think is is really important is think is is really important is &gt;&gt; if he were to run people, I think they &gt;&gt; if he were to run people, I think they have to transcend politics and policy. have to transcend politics and policy. And I think they need to be straight up And I think they need to be straight up bosses. People that have enormous name bosses. People that have enormous name recognition so that effectively what recognition so that effectively what you're voting is a name and not an you're voting is a name and not an agenda. Equivalent to, I think, what agenda. Equivalent to, I think, what happened to Schwarzenegger when he ran. happened to Schwarzenegger when he ran. He ran on an enormous amount of name He ran on an enormous amount of name recognition in the great Davis recall. recognition in the great Davis recall. He didn't run on the platform. I don't He didn't run on the platform. I don't think anybody should mention that. think anybody should mention that. &gt;&gt; JD Vance had this great book, captured &gt;&gt; JD Vance had this great book, captured people's imagination. He's an incredible people's imagination. He's an incredible speaker. He pisses off a third or speaker. He pisses off a third or twothirds of the country depending on twothirds of the country depending on where you are in the country, but you where you are in the country, but you can't ignore him. I think Elon can find can't ignore him. I think Elon can find 10 JD Vance type characters and back 10 JD Vance type characters and back them fairly easily. He is a magnet for them fairly easily. He is a magnet for talent. People will line up. I have been talent. People will line up. I have been contacted by high-profile people. I was contacted by high-profile people. I was actually thinking of running. Can you actually thinking of running. Can you put me in touch with Elon? put me in touch with Elon? &gt;&gt; I was thinking more like actors and &gt;&gt; I was thinking more like actors and sports stars, meaning sports stars, meaning &gt;&gt; where they just come with their own &gt;&gt; where they just come with their own in-built distribution. Like I think you in-built distribution. Like I think you almost have to to rank ex followers and almost have to to rank ex followers and Instagram followers and do a join and Instagram followers and do a join and say, "Okay, these are do you know what I say, "Okay, these are do you know what I mean?" Like I think it's like totally mean?" Like I think it's like totally different. different. different. &gt;&gt; It's painful, guys. It's painful. Like &gt;&gt; It's painful, guys. It's painful. Like let's not get more celebrities as let's not get more celebrities as politicians. Like let's get like people politicians. Like let's get like people who've led large large efforts, large who've led large large efforts, large initiatives, complex things, you know, initiatives, complex things, you know, &gt;&gt; ideally, but they still have to &gt;&gt; ideally, but they still have to communicate, right, Keith? They have to communicate, right, Keith? They have to be able to communicate on a podcast. be able to communicate on a podcast. That's the new platform. That's the new platform. &gt;&gt; If they can't spend two hours, three &gt;&gt; If they can't spend two hours, three hours chopping it up on a podcast like hours chopping it up on a podcast like this or Joe Rogan, this or Joe Rogan, &gt;&gt; you know, that's Camala's the reason she &gt;&gt; you know, that's Camala's the reason she couldn't even contend was because she couldn't even contend was because she couldn't hang for two hours in an couldn't hang for two hours in an intellectual discussion. If you can't intellectual discussion. If you can't hang, you're out in today's political hang, you're out in today's political arena. arena. arena. It'll be interesting to see if he can It'll be interesting to see if he can tune his algorithm for talent, which is tune his algorithm for talent, which is epic, epic, epic, &gt;&gt; to tune for politics because it's a &gt;&gt; to tune for politics because it's a slightly different audience, but if you slightly different audience, but if you can tune the algorithm and quality, that can tune the algorithm and quality, that might work. I think you can win a few might work. I think you can win a few House races. I think that's doable. I House races. I think that's doable. I don't think you can win a Senate race. don't think you can win a Senate race. &gt;&gt; Well, there it is. Elon Keith doesn't &gt;&gt; Well, there it is. Elon Keith doesn't think you can win a Senate race, but he think you can win a Senate race, but he thinks you win a couple congressional thinks you win a couple congressional ones. Thanks for giving him the ones. Thanks for giving him the motivation, Keith. I appreciate it. motivation, Keith. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; I'm sure he's the biggest mistake you've &gt;&gt; I'm sure he's the biggest mistake you've ever made. He's not going to win, too. ever made. He's not going to win, too. People in the Republican party right now People in the Republican party right now are going, "Oh, no. Don't poke the are going, "Oh, no. Don't poke the tiger." Uh, listen. Speaking of tiger." Uh, listen. Speaking of &gt;&gt; That's how Trump got into politics, so I &gt;&gt; That's how Trump got into politics, so I don't want to be Obama here. Okay. don't want to be Obama here. Okay. &gt;&gt; You just Obama, Elon, right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just Obama, Elon, right? Yeah. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. All right. Listen, Scotas made a big All right. Listen, Scotas made a big decision here. This is a really decision here. This is a really important uh decision. Uh they've sided important uh decision. Uh they've sided with Trump for plans for federal with Trump for plans for federal workforce rifts, reductions in workforce workforce rifts, reductions in workforce for those of you who don't know. for those of you who don't know. As you know, Elon, Trump, they wanted As you know, Elon, Trump, they wanted to, you know, downsize the three million to, you know, downsize the three million people who are federal employees. This people who are federal employees. This is just federal employees we're talking is just federal employees we're talking about. We're not talking about military, about. We're not talking about military, and we're not talking about state and and we're not talking about state and city. That's tens of millions of city. That's tens of millions of additional people. If you remember, additional people. If you remember, Trump issued this executive order back Trump issued this executive order back in February when we got in office in February when we got in office implementing the president's Doge implementing the president's Doge Workforce Optimization Initiative. and Workforce Optimization Initiative. and he asked all the federal agencies, hey, he asked all the federal agencies, hey, just prepare a riff for their just prepare a riff for their departments consistent with applicable departments consistent with applicable laws was part of this EO. Okay. In laws was part of this EO. Okay. In April, the American Federation of April, the American Federation of Government Employees, AFGE, sued the Government Employees, AFGE, sued the Trump administration, saying the Trump administration, saying the president must consult Congress on president must consult Congress on large-scale workforce changes. This is a large-scale workforce changes. This is a key debate because the Congress, as you key debate because the Congress, as you know, has power of the purse. They set know, has power of the purse. They set up the money, but the president and the up the money, but the president and the executive branch, they have to execute executive branch, they have to execute on that. And that's what the key is on that. And that's what the key is here. So they accuse Trump of violating here. So they accuse Trump of violating the separation of powers under the the separation of powers under the Constitution Act. AFGE has 820,000 Constitution Act. AFGE has 820,000 members. In May, a San Francisco based members. In May, a San Francisco based federal judge sided with the unions, federal judge sided with the unions, blocking the executive order. The judge, blocking the executive order. The judge, who was appointed by Clinton, said any who was appointed by Clinton, said any reduction in the federal workforce must reduction in the federal workforce must be authorized by Congress. This is a key be authorized by Congress. This is a key issue. And the White House submitted an issue. And the White House submitted an emergency appeal, yada yada. Eight of emergency appeal, yada yada. Eight of nine Supreme Court justices sided with nine Supreme Court justices sided with the White House in overturning this the White House in overturning this block. And so the reasoning, it's very block. And so the reasoning, it's very likely the White House will win the likely the White House will win the argument of the executive order. They argument of the executive order. They have the right to prepare a riff. The have the right to prepare a riff. The question is, can they actually execute question is, can they actually execute on that riff? And who has that power? on that riff? And who has that power? Chimoth, does the power reside with the Chimoth, does the power reside with the president to make large scale or, you president to make large scale or, you know, riffs or do they have to consult know, riffs or do they have to consult Congress first? Your thoughts on this Congress first? Your thoughts on this issue? issue? issue? &gt;&gt; It's an incredibly important ruling. &gt;&gt; It's an incredibly important ruling. incredibly right. incredibly right. incredibly right. I think President Trump should have I think President Trump should have absolute leeway to decide how the people absolute leeway to decide how the people that report to him act and do their job. that report to him act and do their job. &gt;&gt; If you take a step back, Jason, there &gt;&gt; If you take a step back, Jason, there are more than 2,000 federal agencies. are more than 2,000 federal agencies. Employees plus contractors, Employees plus contractors, I think, number 3 million people. If you I think, number 3 million people. If you put three million people into 2,00 put three million people into 2,00 agencies agencies agencies and then you give them and then you give them very poor and outdated technology, which very poor and outdated technology, which unfortunately most of the government unfortunately most of the government operates on, what are you going to get? operates on, what are you going to get? You're going to get incredibly slow You're going to get incredibly slow processes. processes. processes. You're going to get You're going to get a lot of checking and double-checking a lot of checking and double-checking and you're going to ultimately just get and you're going to ultimately just get a lot of regulations because they're a lot of regulations because they're trying to do what they think is the trying to do what they think is the right job. So since 1993, what have we right job. So since 1993, what have we seen? Regulations have gotten out of seen? Regulations have gotten out of control. It's like a 100,000 new rules control. It's like a 100,000 new rules per some number of months. Like it's per some number of months. Like it's just crazy. So eventually we all succumb just crazy. So eventually we all succumb to an infinite number of rules that we to an infinite number of rules that we all end up violating and not even know all end up violating and not even know it. it. it. &gt;&gt; So if the CEO of the United States, &gt;&gt; So if the CEO of the United States, President Trump, isn't allowed to fire President Trump, isn't allowed to fire people, then all of that stuff just people, then all of that stuff just compounds. So I think that this is a compounds. So I think that this is a really important really important really important thing that just happened. It allows us thing that just happened. It allows us to now level set how big should the to now level set how big should the government be? But more importantly, the government be? But more importantly, the number of people number of people in the government are also the ones that in the government are also the ones that then direct downstream spend that make then direct downstream spend that make net new rules. And if you can slow the net new rules. And if you can slow the growth of that down, you're actually growth of that down, you're actually doing a lot. In many ways, doing a lot. In many ways, I wish Elon had come in and created Doge I wish Elon had come in and created Doge now. now. now. &gt;&gt; Like, could you imagine if Doge was &gt;&gt; Like, could you imagine if Doge was created the day after this Supreme Court created the day after this Supreme Court ruling? It would have been a totally ruling? It would have been a totally different outcome, I think, because with different outcome, I think, because with that Supreme Court ruling in hand, these that Supreme Court ruling in hand, these guys probably would have been like a hot guys probably would have been like a hot knife through butter, knife through butter, &gt;&gt; Travis. &gt;&gt; Travis. &gt;&gt; Travis. &gt;&gt; So, I I think it's a big deal. &gt;&gt; So, I I think it's a big deal. &gt;&gt; Except that ruling doesn't happen &gt;&gt; Except that ruling doesn't happen without Doge. That Doge caused that without Doge. That Doge caused that ruling to occur. ruling to occur. &gt;&gt; True. Well, the EO did you could have &gt;&gt; True. Well, the EO did you could have passed all that was all Doge style, passed all that was all Doge style, though. You know what I'm saying? It was though. You know what I'm saying? It was &gt;&gt; If they wasn't firing people, yeah, they &gt;&gt; If they wasn't firing people, yeah, they probably wouldn't felt the need to your probably wouldn't felt the need to your point, Travis, to actually file this. point, Travis, to actually file this. But Travis, if you are living in the age But Travis, if you are living in the age of AI efficiency right now, operations of AI efficiency right now, operations of companies is changing dramatically. of companies is changing dramatically. Can you imagine telling somebody you you Can you imagine telling somebody you you can be CEO, but you can't change can be CEO, but you can't change personnel. That's the job. You get to be personnel. That's the job. You get to be CEO, but you just can't change the CEO, but you just can't change the players on the team. You can buy the players on the team. You can buy the Knicks, but you can't change the coach. Knicks, but you can't change the coach. &gt;&gt; No, you can grow. You just can't shrink &gt;&gt; No, you can grow. You just can't shrink it. it. it. &gt;&gt; It's like a It's like running a &gt;&gt; It's like a It's like running a unionized company, which actually does unionized company, which actually does exist. Are largeized companies where you exist. Are largeized companies where you can't do any of these things, can't do any of these things, &gt;&gt; right? Do do they still exist or are &gt;&gt; right? Do do they still exist or are they all gone? they all gone? &gt;&gt; They're going quickly. &gt;&gt; They're going quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. &gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. &gt;&gt; I think this just gets back to what what &gt;&gt; I think this just gets back to what what is actually Congress authorizing when a is actually Congress authorizing when a bill occurs. And there's certain things bill occurs. And there's certain things that are specific and certain things that are specific and certain things that aren't. And I don't I'm not sure that aren't. And I don't I'm not sure that in in a lot of these bills, it's that in in a lot of these bills, it's not very specific about exactly how many not very specific about exactly how many people must be hired. And so if it's I'm people must be hired. And so if it's I'm just doing the common man's sort of just doing the common man's sort of approach to this, which is like if if approach to this, which is like if if the law says you have to hire x number the law says you have to hire x number of people, then that is what it is. If of people, then that is what it is. If the law says you here's some money to the law says you here's some money to spend, here are the ways in which to spend, here are the ways in which to spend it, but it's not specific about spend it, but it's not specific about how many people you hire, then that is how many people you hire, then that is different. different. different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It should be outcome based. Hey, &gt;&gt; Yeah. It should be outcome based. Hey, here's the goal. Here's the the key here's the goal. Here's the the key objectives, right? objectives, right? objectives, right? &gt;&gt; Travis Travis is totally right. Like &gt;&gt; Travis Travis is totally right. Like there are there's a variety of different there are there's a variety of different laws, some with incredible laws, some with incredible specificities, some with very broad specificities, some with very broad mandates. The Constitution clearly says mandates. The Constitution clearly says that all executive power resides in the that all executive power resides in the president of the United States. Period. president of the United States. Period. There's no exceptions there. However, There's no exceptions there. However, Congress does appropriate money and post Congress does appropriate money and post Watergate, Watergate, Watergate, many people think Congress has the power many people think Congress has the power to force the president to spend the to force the president to spend the money. And you can debate that. You can money. And you can debate that. You can debate it on a per statute basis. And debate it on a per statute basis. And that will be more nuanced and that's that will be more nuanced and that's going to get litigated whether the going to get litigated whether the president can refuse to spend money that president can refuse to spend money that Congress explicitly instructed him to Congress explicitly instructed him to spend, sometimes called empowerment. spend, sometimes called empowerment. That's a very interesting intellectual That's a very interesting intellectual debate. This one's a little bit easier. debate. This one's a little bit easier. It'll get more complicated again like It'll get more complicated again like this EO is only approved to allow for this EO is only approved to allow for the planning. I think the vote might be the planning. I think the vote might be closer. I think there's still a majority closer. I think there's still a majority on the Supreme Court for the actual on the Supreme Court for the actual implementation, but it may not be 81 implementation, but it may not be 81 when there's a specific plan that when there's a specific plan that possibly navigate its way through the possibly navigate its way through the courts again. courts again. courts again. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's super fascinating. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's super fascinating. Yeah. I wonder if they're going to get Yeah. I wonder if they're going to get to the point where they're going to say to the point where they're going to say in every bill, you need to hire this in every bill, you need to hire this number of people to hit number of people to hit &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if they can. Like &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if they can. Like that's where it gets borderline that's where it gets borderline unconstitutional. like where you unconstitutional. like where you actually prescribe that the president in actually prescribe that the president in the exercise of his constitutional the exercise of his constitutional duties has to hire certain number of duties has to hire certain number of people people people &gt;&gt; that feels pretty precarious. &gt;&gt; that feels pretty precarious. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm not sure, Keith. That's &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm not sure, Keith. That's just like they prescribe a whole bunch just like they prescribe a whole bunch of other things like you must you must of other things like you must you must appropriate money for to this specific appropriate money for to this specific institution to do this specific work. institution to do this specific work. &gt;&gt; But that's not an executive function. &gt;&gt; But that's not an executive function. Like if you said like the secretary of Like if you said like the secretary of state has to have x number of employees state has to have x number of employees doing something, the secretary of state doing something, the secretary of state is your personal representative to is your personal representative to conduct foreign affairs on behalf of the conduct foreign affairs on behalf of the president of the United States. It gets president of the United States. It gets a little bit more messy as you translate a little bit more messy as you translate it to people um that the president it to people um that the president should I mean yes Congress does set you should I mean yes Congress does set you know which people are subject to Senate know which people are subject to Senate confirmation, what their salaries and confirmation, what their salaries and compensation bans are. So it's it's compensation bans are. So it's it's never going to be fully binary where the never going to be fully binary where the president can do whatever he wants and president can do whatever he wants and it's never gonna I don't think it'll be it's never gonna I don't think it'll be constitutional for Congress to mandate constitutional for Congress to mandate and put all kinds of handcuffs on the and put all kinds of handcuffs on the president. president. president. &gt;&gt; Well, then you you also have performance &gt;&gt; Well, then you you also have performance that comes in here. What if you look at that comes in here. What if you look at the Department of Education? You say the Department of Education? You say scores have gone down. We've spent this scores have gone down. We've spent this money. We're not getting the results. money. We're not getting the results. Therefore, these people are incompetent. Therefore, these people are incompetent. Therefore, I'm firing them for cause and Therefore, I'm firing them for cause and I'm going to hire new people. How are I'm going to hire new people. How are you going to stop the executive from you going to stop the executive from doing that? There's been a bunch of doing that? There's been a bunch of litigation, you know, in parallel to litigation, you know, in parallel to this litigation about the president's this litigation about the president's ability to fire people. And for the most ability to fire people. And for the most part, the Supreme Court's basically, part, the Supreme Court's basically, with maybe the exception of the Federal with maybe the exception of the Federal Reserve chair, said that the president Reserve chair, said that the president can fire pretty much anybody he wants. can fire pretty much anybody he wants. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the way to go is like I &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the way to go is like I mean, I hate to be cut, but if the mean, I hate to be cut, but if the results aren't there, results aren't there, &gt;&gt; I think if they're presidential Yeah. If &gt;&gt; I think if they're presidential Yeah. If they're a presidential appointee, the they're a presidential appointee, the president should be able to fire you at president should be able to fire you at will. Just like if you were a VP at one will. Just like if you were a VP at one of our companies, the CEO should be able of our companies, the CEO should be able to fire you at will. to fire you at will. &gt;&gt; But what about Keith? If the whole &gt;&gt; But what about Keith? If the whole department sucks. Hey, you guys were department sucks. Hey, you guys were responsible for early education. You had responsible for early education. You had to put together a plan. The plan failed. to put together a plan. The plan failed. Everybody's fired. We're starting over. Everybody's fired. We're starting over. Like, you should be allowed to do that. Like, you should be allowed to do that. How are we going to have an efficient How are we going to have an efficient government? government? government? &gt;&gt; Some of these departments were created &gt;&gt; Some of these departments were created by congressional statute, like the by congressional statute, like the Department of Education in 1979. And Department of Education in 1979. And you're right, every single educational you're right, every single educational stat has got worse in the United States stat has got worse in the United States since the department was created. But since the department was created. But [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there is a law on the books that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there is a law on the books that says there shall be a department of says there shall be a department of education. So you may have to repeal education. So you may have to repeal that. that. that. &gt;&gt; All right, listen. We're at an hour and &gt;&gt; All right, listen. We're at an hour and a half, gentlemen.
