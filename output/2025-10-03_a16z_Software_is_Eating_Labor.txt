DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
Software has fundamentally changed the way we record, store, and share information. Its next act is to fundamentally change the nature of our economy, capturing trillions of dollars of value in the process.

In this talk from the 2025 a16z LP Summit, a16z General Partner Alex Rampell discusses the history of filing cabinets and databases, how SaaS pricing moved from seats to outcomes, and how AI agents will accelerate the trend of the last 70 years of software progress.

----------------------------------------
The worldwide SAS market is about $300 billion uh per year. The labor market in the US alone is 13 trillion. What software is now going after, the prize that it's going after is the labor market. Almost every software company has basically taken a filing cabinet and turned it into a database. But what's happening now is the whole thing is effectively done endto end. I'm going to talk about how software eats labor. Um and uh you know first Mark wrote an essay for the Wall Street Journal a long time ago about 10 years ago about how software eats the world. I guess the labor labor force falls within the world. So this is a natural follow-up. But if there's only one takeaway that I can leave with with you today is that the labor market this is almost obvious is so much bigger than the software market. So the worldwide SAS market is about $300 billion uh per year. Uh worldwide market cap is about $2.2 $2 trillion. The labor market in the US alone is 13 trillion. So much much bigger. And it doesn't mean that the software market will suddenly be worth $13 trillion a year. But what software is now going after, the prize that it's going after is the labor market. And I figured there's nothing better than starting a venture capital conference with a picture of the world's most famous communist. That's Karl Marx right there. And if if you've read Dos Capitol, which which I read back at college, um if if you remember like the the central tenant is that there's capital and labor and capital exploits labor. They're they're two distinct things. But uh what's really exciting, this is almost like a chemical equation is that the capital that you give us, we give to companies. What do the companies do with the capital? They buy GPUs or rent them. They hire engineers. They buy coffee. They give coffee and GPUs to the engineers. And then out pops software that does the job of labor. And and this is it's like the new E= MCÂ². And we're seeing this happen at so many companies. And these companies are scaling so quickly because they really are selling into clients or you know end users and saying, "Hey, we'll do this job for you. We're not giving you software. We're going to do a job for you." And that that's the sales pitch. Um and obviously like this concept is not new per se. I mean like uh automation has been around for a long time. So you know seamstresses you know here here's a you know a picture from I don't know probably the 1600s or 1700s. The loom replaced those jobs but you still had somebody that had to operate the loom. Um or steam ships. You know there there were no iPhones back then. So I don't actually have have a picture of Roman Orsman but they probably look like this. And sailboats and steam ships obviously made that form of labor much more efficient. But you still need somebody to operate and you know shovel coal into the steam ship and put the sails up on the mast. Um and then of course the the printing press invented by Gutenberg like that was a big innovation. Um and the steam powered press allowed you know the LA Times to print out hundreds of thousands of copies of that newspaper versus somebody you know manually cranking one each time. And uh and you know lastly like the assembly line was a massive innovation in terms of replacing people that hand assembled every gizmo and now you have an assembly line but you know a lot of people worked on the assembly line. So again this concept is not new like you could always take capital make a machine and then have more efficient labor on the other side but what's happening now is the whole thing is effectively done end to end and I I want to take you through a journey of what the software market has always been because I think understanding the past is the best window of actually understanding the future and what's possible. So my my thesis is that almost every software company has basically taken a filing cabinet and turned it into a database. And this is where the $2.2 trillion of market cap has come from. This is where the $300 billion in annual software revenue has come from. And the first example that I'd like to point to is a company called Saber Systems. Um this is with two A's. if you've seen it. It's a company in Texas, but this was a joint project of American Airlines and IBM back when IBM was the the most powerful uh computer company in the world, technology company in the world because uh at least according to chat GPT, I asked for some graphical help here. Like what would it have looked like to book an airline ticket in 1959? Like what how did American Airlines handle this? They probably had like lots of filing cabinets with like sheets like this. So Betty Owens calls up and says, "I want to sit in four. I want to sit in seat 4 A." Talks to somebody on the phone. Oh, wait. No, actually I want to cancel my flight. They have to erase it. No, actually I want to seat I want to sit in seat 2C. Erase that again. You know, filing cabinets basically kept track of everything. It was pretty inefficient. You had a lot of people that worked the filing cabinets. You couldn't share information from one office to another because everything was doiciled in one filing cabinet. Um, and Saber changed the game by putting it all on an IBM mainframe and then having lots of kind of thin client terminals that were used by travel agents around the world that could access that mainframe. And this is how travel was uh revolutionized. Uh, Galileo did this for hotels. Amadeas did this for Europe. I mean like big companies came out of this. Um, and of course the same process happened for sales. So I think somebody yesterday mentioned Glengary, Glenn Ross, great movie. But if you remember there were lots of business cards. You wanted to get the Glengary leads. Those were the good leads. Those were pieces of paper. Um, and uh, for for those of you that are old like me, you might remember a company called Axe Systems in the 1980s. This was one of the big CRM companies of the day. Gold mine followed that in 1990 and then Tom Seville started Sevil Systems in 1993. But all of these took the filing cabinets of sales, you know, put them originally in uh, kind of mainframes and then Salesforce came in in 1999, put that in the cloud. But you know, again, the same salesperson that accessed the physical file in a fictional movie set in the 1950s would now access a Salesforce record in 2010. Same process, just different medium. Um, manufacturing and inventory. This is another big one. So, imagine that you're a product manufacturer. How many widgets do I own? You know, what's my inventory? What's my sales? IBM again at the forefront of this. But other companies, you know, some that are around today like SAP started in 1972. Bond, JD Edwards, Epicor, Sage, I2, these are all big companies that basically digitized old-fashioned records. Um, my favorite one just to show how pervasive this idea is, is there was actually a big business in library card cataloges. So, libraries were have been around for a very, very long time. You know, Library of Alexandria, right? Like long long time. um the Dewey decibel system comes out and you know when I was growing up I'd go to like the card catalog and figure out okay they're all alphabetically sorted and then eventually somebody created started with this company called OLC um built a you know reasonably sized business and sort of innovative Cersei Dynx of digitizing those card cataloges where now you enter into a terminal at the computer uh in the library and then you figure out where your book is is it in stock um legal case files you know like every time I went to a law firm in 1980s it's like most of the square footage was filing cabinets and companies like PC Law like a lot of Lexus Nexus and Reuters revenue comes from you know selling to law firms digitizing things that would otherwise occupy so much square footage in the nice you know Fifth Avenue uh you know offices of of law firms were accountants growing up and I remember going to their office and again there there was no room for a little 5-year-old to run around because all filing cabinets you know into it comes along with QuickBooks digitiz ized um financial statements. Um Peach Tree, this is a company from the 1970s, MYOB, like lots of companies. Again, filing cabinets, filing cabinets. You you get the uh the drill here. U my my favorite name in the history of software is filing cabinets. The first electronic health records company was a company called Mumps, which arguably is the worst name in the history of software. It like somehow lost out to malaria or measles or something, but this was Mass General Hospital. um and they wanted to replace their filing cabinets and they came up with this programming language and database system called Mums. But Epic and Cerner, Epic is the biggest electronic health records company in the world. It was started in 1979. Um so again and what they did was just digitize these massive number of files that every hospital system and doctor would have in their office. And kind of lastly here uh HR and payroll. So actually even before Saber uh automated data processing ADP was started in 1949. How do you keep track of time and attendance? You know, you had your time slip, your time cards. How do I figure out tax withholding? All of these companies came out and the again the progression was I take the file, I put it in a mainframe and then companies like you know workday was effectively Peopleoft. It was the same team that started Peopleoft. They put it in the cloud. But the same process was there. The people that looked at your time and attendance slip in 1940 were the same people that looked at it in 2015. But now the medium was not paper. It was not mainframe. It was cloud. And the reason why I mention all of this is because nothing has actually gotten that much more efficient because the filing cabinets were read by humans. The digital records are read by humans, right? It's like this woman here, whatever she's doing, looking at, you know, help helping a customer with customer support needs or something. Once upon a time would have looked at a piece of paper, now is looking at a computer. And the reason why this is so important to understand is because the whole business model of software has to change. It has to change. Um, this is what I call to as a as homage to to Starbucks here the the tall grande venty model of SAS. Like if you go to any SAS company in the world, you go to their landing page, it probably looks like this. This is a company called Zenesk. It's now a private company. It was taken private by Premier and Helman Freeman a few years ago. Um, and this is a $2 billion ARR company that sells seats. So, you know, their most popular like the the Venty package is you get the sweet professional $115 a month. But, you know, we've talked about in the last couple days how now AI does a really good job answering customer support queries. So, how many seats do you need if every one of your agents is 9,000 times more productive? Imagine that you have a thousand seats. And I I drew this out for you so you could see it. Like, imagine that I've got a,000 people working in my customer support call center. I pay each one fully loaded $75,000 a year. So that's $75 million a year in cost for people. Well, what's my software cost? Well, it's a a,000 time 115* 12. It's about $1.4 million a year for the software. So the people cost is so much higher than the software cost. And this could go one of two directions for a company like Zenesk. If it turns out that AI can answer all the questions, how many seats do you need? Zero. You don't need a single seat left. the AI answers everything and then Zenesk is charging per seat. So they would go from 1.4 million to zero dollars in revenue. That would be very bad. On the other hand, I mean, look look at the math here. Like if if each human is answering 2,000 questions a year, right now your fully loaded cost as the the company that uses Zenesk as your system of record for answering customer support. It's about $37 of of human cost and 69 cents of software cost. Like the cost per answer is $38. And this is, you know, rough rough uh company example. Um maybe Zenesk could charge $5 million a year. Like I, hey, don't spend $75 million a year on support anymore. Spend $5 million a year on support. Just pay it all to us. Don't pay us 1.4 million. Pay us 5 million. Save75. And so Zenesk is really at the precipice of it's like their revenue could go to zero or their revenue could 3x. And like where's it going to go? I I don't know the answer. They don't know the answer. I've been talking to their CEO. are piloting outcomebased pricing in New Zealand right now. So New Zealand holds the answer to all of our questions. So uh stay tuned. And um you know just to give again another example of just how much bigger these labor or quasi labor markets are like the $13 trillion of wages that we talked about um you know software revenue is very small. If you just take one category like just just one particular profession and take the example of nurses just because we have a portfolio company in this space um nurses in the United States of America earn about $650 billion a year. There about four and a half million registered nurses. That's bigger than the entire worldwide software market. And it doesn't mean that software will take like the the nursing software market will be this big. But it means like this is the pool that you're really playing against. And the reason why I wanted to start with the filing cabinets is like this is going to start moving to outcomes. Like the the the software is going to go from being the filing cabinet to effectively operating on the filing cabinet. And what does that mean? Well, you know, take the first example. If I have the filing cabinet for travel, you know, maybe the software can rebook flights or I want to book a trip for 75 kids at my my son's high school and need to talk to an agent. I don't need to talk to an agent anymore. I just talk to the software company. I talk directly to United Airlines, you know, AI and they do the entire thing for me. Sales, I mean, this is kind of obvious. You know, Salesforce charges per seat per month. Salesforce should just sell for me. I don't want to pay for a thousand seats. I want to pay for customers. Like, hey, go go go get me customers because you're the backend for that anyway. Or survey all of my customers. Do a 30-minute phone call with every single one of them. See how they're doing. Are they happy? Are they going to re renew with me? Yes or no? You know what about manufacturing? Well, imagine that I make widgets and there are these things called tariffs that are happening. I'd love to figure out what my tariff exposure is. Let me just ask my ERP system, research that for me. Um, or I want you to do an audit or call my suppliers and see if they're going to still be able to to to ship me their things on time. Uh, library card cataloges, as crazy as this one is, you know what? If my book is overdue, the librarian shouldn't be calling me. the library card software company should be calling me saying, "Hey buddy, return the book or order more books because this one's very popular." You know, Ben Ben's book is selling out. Order more copies of that. Um, legal case files, like a lot of software companies that are popping up in this space. It's no longer the system of record for like time and attendance. Like, draft me a contract. Like, do that work for me. You could start billing out. Again, unclear how the pricing model of this is going to work, but start billing for that. Um, accounting and bookkeeping. Um, you know, AR aging summary, like this concept has been around for a long time. I have a lot of companies that owe me a money, a lot of clients that owe me money. Um, in 1940, I'd look at the printout and say, I'm going to call these customers and hopefully collect for them or send the guy with the crowbar or do something. In 2000, I'd look at the QuickBooks thing and do the same thing. Now, the software company can go call like QuickBooks is going to start calling customers uh of of their clients and say, "Hey, you you owe me money. please pay me back and I I can accept a payment on the phone right now. Um, health records. So, if you saw me limp off stage, I sadly had Achilles repair surgery about three months ago. I don't recommend it. Uh, the day after my surgery, I got a call from Stanford Hospital saying, you know, Alex, on a scale of 1 to 10, what's your pain level? And I said, 11. And they said, very funny. And I said, no, it really is 11. Um, and uh, an AI nurse can't do CPR, right? An AI nurse can't attend to a gunshot wound victim, but an AI nurse can totally call a mid-40s patient like me and say, "How are you doing? Is there anything we can help with?" You know, "Do you have a fever? Oh, you do? You should go to the hospital right now." And stuff like that. And again, these are the outcomes. These are the operations that can be performed on if you have my medical record, that's what you do with it. And charge for that. Charge $20 for that outbound call. Um, HR and payroll. How do I do a reference check? How how do I make sure that you on your resume you said you worked at these three companies? You know what? Workday should call those three companies and say, "Did Alex really work there?" Um explain benefits, help with enrollment. Workday could probably triple their revenue if they start doing this because they're already the system of record. So, um if you know the story of Airbnb, uh Airbnb famously started by somewhat scraping Craigslist. Craigslist is this horrible site from the mid90s that has not changed since the mid '90s. And they have lots of listings for apartments. and you go look at an apartment and like half the time it's a scam, half the time it's already been booked or you know it's been relisted every single day and they basically put them in a better interface and called it uh Airbnb and that's how they got started. And this is one of the most exciting things that we're seeing, which is here's a real ad on Craigslist. Because since I have so much copious time due to my set Achilles injury, I I used to run every day, a bike every day. I can't do that anymore. So I hang out on Craigslist looking for jobs. Not for myself, of course. Uh and uh here's a job for Plaza Lane Optometry. They're hiring a front desk receptionist and they've had this job opening for 6 months. It's been hanging out there for 6 months. the uh job pro like you have to now say in California how much you're char how much you're going to pay it's $45,000 a year so supply and demand if they probably said we're going to pay $100,000 a year they would have filled this job they're paying they need to pay $45,000 a year to make this work within their cost model or something if you look at the job responsibilities if you can read this like the first one is like open and close the shop lock the door AI can't do that but a lot of the other job responsibilities AI can completely do it's you know argue with insurance company call patient the day before their appointment to prevent no-shows. If somebody doesn't show up, that's a big opportunity cost for the optometrist. And if you were to look at the optometry market and say, is that a good software market? You would say categorically no. Because Plaza optometry probably spends $500 a year on software. They probably have a Microsoft Office license. Uh they probably have a website with Squarespace or Wix and that's it. So they probably spend $500 a year. So, in this new world, and again, we're seeing a lot of companies doing this. They peruse Craigslist. They look for a job listing and they're like, "Hey, Plaza Lane Optometry, I want to apply for the job." And you know, the optometry is like, "Okay, that sounds great. Tell me about your qualifications. Where did you work before?" It's like, "I know this sounds crazy, but I'm a software company and I can I can't close the doors and do this, but I can do these other eight things. Can I give you a demo?" And at first, the optometrist is like, "No, I want to Oh, okay. I'll try it out." And by the way, it's $20,000 a year, which is much less than the $45,000 a year that you were going to pay for a human that you can't even hire. So this is happening right now and it's incredible. And again, like the software spend small for these people, the effective labor spend much much higher. And and this is what's massively growing the market for a lot of these obscure industries. So I just thought uh rather than me talk, I want to give you an example. Um, this is one of our portfolio companies, Happy Robot, which serves the uh the freight and uh and trucking space. So, so listen, this is a a negotiation on the phone conducted with a prospective client and AI, Illinois. All right. So, this is Juliet, Illinois to today between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. Delivers Monday between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. I have 700 on this one. Would you like to book this load? See? Um, I'm going to need 800 for this one. I can check on that. So, um, we can't do eight at this point. Any chance you could come a bit closer to the loadboard rate? I could I could do a 775. That's really my lowest. I understand. So, um, no chance you could do any better than 775. Um, how about 750? Let me see. Okay, I was able to get you 735 here. 735. Okay. So that that's a closed transaction. Who who's the robot and who's the human? This is like the new touring test. I'll let you guys quiz me afterwards on that with with your own theories. Here's another example. Um this is a company called Salient that does collections. So if you have if you're a lender, if you're an auto lender, um you know, you have to collect loan, you have to collect uh re repayments on your loans. And Salant serves a lot of auto lenders in this country. And here's here's another call from them. Currently, your account is 51 days past due for $825.35. Would you be able to make a payment today? So the cool thing there is that Salant speaks dozens of languages. So it speaks Tagalog, it speaks Vietnamese, Mandarin, and again like this is a really important point. It's not just about cost. Um cost like this is where people are getting this wrong. It's not like oh AI is going to take all the jobs because humans are too expensive and AI is cheaper. AI does a bunch of things like intermittent demand is a big one. Um, imagine that I'm Black Friday retail. I'm a retailer and people know that, you know, sales are much higher around Black Friday. So, I would have to hire tons of cashiers or if I'm an online retailer, hire lots of customer support people to go answer queries and whatnot and then what do I do on January 1st? Do I fire them all and then rehire them in November? But actually, I should probably hire them in September because I have to train them. Kind of tricky. And there are a lot of other industries that have intermittent demand issues. I mean, United Airlines, if they have bad weather over Chicago, which of course never happens, they can't just hire and train 10,000 people overnight, but again, AI very, very good at that. The other example is there there are a lot of demoralizing jobs out there. What is a demoralizing job? Well, collections is kind of a demoralizing job because you go call people and say, "Hey, you're overdue." About half the time, and I've listened to some of these calls, there are lots of expletives on the on the other side, right? So, it's like, "Hey, you owe me money." It's like, "F you, you never call me again." and it's like h call back again hey you owe me money f you never call me again a human would get kind of tired of that it's not a fun job um AI doesn't get bothered so again demoralizing jobs very very good regulatory certainty so go back to this um you know I co-ounded a company called the firm um we got trained every quarter on UDAP unfair defect sorry unfair deceptive and abusive practices so there are lots of laws that mandate what you can and can't say to a customer so imagine that you're calling a customer say hey you owe me money the customer says, "F you." And then you have somebody on the other end who's had a kind of a bad day and you can't blame them. It's like, "F you back, customer." They're going to get in trouble for that, right? And you have more certainty when you can program effectively a robot to conduct the entire call end to end much more so than people. And my my favorite example here is somebody who studied, you know, too I I I speak Russian, Japanese, and a smattering of Spanish and and spent way too much time learning that stuff. Languages, languages, languages. I mean, it's just fact that a nurse, an AI nurse, like what if I only spoke Farsy? Does Stanford have any Farsy speaking nurses that can call me about my pain level? What if I only spoke Mongolian? Like, now they do. An AI nurse, an AI collections agent, an AI negotiator. Like, all of these things can be done in dozens of different languages instantly. And you just wouldn't hire a human for that. can't get somebody in Iowa that speaks Serbian um on demand intermittently with a demoralizing job and so on and so forth. You know, AI does great. Um and and it's also very important that AI expands the market and this is why I wanted to start with the story of filing cabinets because there was no software company for compliance because uh this is actually a fact from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The fastest growing job in America is manicurist pedicurist. AI can't do that. Uh the second fact fastest is compliance officer. So compliance officer uh you don't need software for compliance officers. If you're a city bank, you need more people. Um and no company has popped up effectively doing software because it's like the software market's kind of small. The people market's very large. Now you can roll into city and say, "Hey, I will do compliance for you endtoend as a software solution. Pay me $10 million a year and I'm your software product that kind of tracks everything." Because before they would just h they would just get more Microsoft Office licenses or collections like there is no software company for collections. There are collections people at collections firms. Now you can actually enter potentially with the wedge of voice and this is going to get commoditized quickly and we realize this. But you can backfill into a software company with real software revenue, real software margins, real software retention. Um, the other thing that you're going to start seeing us do is there are a lot of nonAI companies that now work because of AI. So, because of my said very sad injury, I'm I'm a big cyclist as I mentioned. Uh, my garage looks like this with a lot of bikes that aren't being used. Um, I hope to use them again in the future. Why isn't there an Airbnb for bicycles? Why hasn't somebody built that? Well, I'll tell you why. It's a very bad idea. That's why nobody's done it. And why is it a bad idea? Because the central tenant, AI, not AI. It could be in 2000 BC. It doesn't really matter. If your customer acquisition cost plus your cost of goods sold is greater than your lifetime value, do not proceed. That's not a business. But now with AI, um, you know, imagine that I wanted to start Airbnb for bicycles. Well, how am I going to go get the people that have spare bicycles in their garage? Am I gonna hire a bunch of like, you know, expensive Stanford kids in Palo Alto and have to give them 20 different flavors of coconut water and, you know, cater to their millennial needs in order for them to work in the sales operation in Palo Alto? No, I'm going to have an AI sales rep call everybody. And the cost per AI sales rep per year is a few hundred bucks, not $100,000. Uh, no coconut water necessary. Well, what if there's an emergency? Well, you know, now there's a 1-800 number that you call that's an AI rep that can do everything. Call the police, call whatever. Um, and you know, lastly, like how do I screen this person, do a background check, is the bicycle good, is it stole, like whatever you would need to do this this silly business that we're not going to fund. Um, AI can do this as well. So, you actually have a whole category of of business which was like it would have worked except for this pesky customer acquisition cost or pesky pesky cost of goods sold. And of course, AI, you can vibe code your way into one of these businesses anyway. Um so you know massively expands the size of the market the nonAI market given the AI infrastructure just allowing you know CAC to come down COGS to come down for now I mean every company is going to start using these tools so you know it will it will become a version of the yoga bear quote it's so crowded nobody goes here anymore but now lot of companies kind of prosecuting sometimes older new ideas that just wouldn't have worked 5 years ago um and this is a global opportunity right I mean like the the US labor market big it's 13 trillion a year. The worldwide labor market's so much bigger. And our job on on behalf of your capital here, our our labor on behalf of your capital is to find the best companies that will make software look small. So, thank you very much.
