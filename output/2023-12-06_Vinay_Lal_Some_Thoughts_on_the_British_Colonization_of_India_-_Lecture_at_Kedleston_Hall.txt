DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
This lecture was delivered by me on 21 June 2023 in the grand rotunda at Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire, England.  Kedleston Hall is a property managed by the National Trust; it is the ancestral estate of the Curzon family.  George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess of Kedleston, was the Viceroy of India (1898-1905) and subsequently the Foreign Secretary in the British Government (1919-1924).  He is often viewed as the most remarkable, ambitious, and controversial of all the viceroys of India.  This lecture, however, is not on Curzon, though delivered at the ancestral Curzon estate; its subject is the British colonization of India and the path of destruction sowed by the British in India. It is unsparing in its critique of British rule in India.  Unfortunately, there is a considerable echo present in the recording, but nevertheless at a slightly lower volume it can be heard reasonably well.

say may not be now what I have to say may not be entirely pleasant but uh I think you entirely pleasant but uh I think you should also bear in mind uh that uh I should also bear in mind uh that uh I come from a background where in addition come from a background where in addition to British India I've been studying the to British India I've been studying the life and thought of mamas Gandhi I've life and thought of mamas Gandhi I've been doing that for four decades as well been doing that for four decades as well I've published about 60 long essays uh I've published about 60 long essays uh which are now being collected together which are now being collected together in three volumes um so one of the things in three volumes um so one of the things that learned from that learned from Gandhi was and I will end on this note Gandhi was and I will end on this note as well so I want you to bear that in as well so I want you to bear that in mind at the outset but one of the things mind at the outset but one of the things I learned from I learned from my long exploration of the life of my long exploration of the life of Gandhi is that Gandhi is that freedom is freedom is freedom is indivisible if one person is unfree the indivisible if one person is unfree the other person cannot be free they may other person cannot be free they may think they're think they're think they're free oppression is a problem for the free oppression is a problem for the oppressor as much as it is for the oppressor as much as it is for the oppressed now if you bear that in mind oppressed now if you bear that in mind you will understand the spirit in in you will understand the spirit in in which these observations are being which these observations are being offered because I want to suggest to offered because I want to suggest to you that British you that British colonization was not just colonization was not just extraordinarily harmful to India which extraordinarily harmful to India which indeed it indeed it indeed it was and I'm going to establish that very was and I'm going to establish that very briefly but it was also harmful to briefly but it was also harmful to Britain and that part of the story I Britain and that part of the story I think is almost never talked about nor think is almost never talked about nor is it understood even in Britain is it understood even in Britain all right so all right so that's the Outlook the the frame within that's the Outlook the the frame within which I would like you to consider my which I would like you to consider my observations so my first observation and observations so my first observation and so I put it in as as a set of 10 so I put it in as as a set of 10 questions or considerations or questions or considerations or conundrums which I will share with you conundrums which I will share with you but the first thing I want to move into but the first thing I want to move into before I do that is I want to think before I do that is I want to think about about about colonialism in relationship to the colonialism in relationship to the Holocaust Holocaust Holocaust I think you will all agree with me we're I think you will all agree with me we're well aware of the fact that there are well aware of the fact that there are people even people even people even today who do deny the Holocaust but today who do deny the Holocaust but there are a minuscule number of those there are a minuscule number of those people I mean there are people who may people I mean there are people who may dispute just exactly how many dispute just exactly how many Jews were killed during the Jews were killed during the Holocaust and we do know by the way that Holocaust and we do know by the way that there were people other Jews who were there were people other Jews who were killed there were Poes who were not Jews killed there were Poes who were not Jews who were killed they were homosexuals in who were killed they were homosexuals in the concentration camps political the concentration camps political denters the Roma or the gypsies as they denters the Roma or the gypsies as they known or Travelers as they're known in known or Travelers as they're known in the United Kingdom they were among many the United Kingdom they were among many others who were killed but whatever the others who were killed but whatever the disputes about exactly how the camps disputes about exactly how the camps function and all of that what is function and all of that what is emphatically clear unequivocally clear emphatically clear unequivocally clear is that the the is that the the Holocaust is a reality which very few Holocaust is a reality which very few people doubt now when we get to the people doubt now when we get to the story of colonialism it's very story of colonialism it's very different as an Indian scholar working different as an Indian scholar working on colonialism I astonished by how many on colonialism I astonished by how many scholars leted on people in the general scholars leted on people in the general public still public still public still debate the pros and cons of debate the pros and cons of colonialism there is nothing to colonialism there is nothing to debate there is absolutely nothing to debate there is absolutely nothing to debate about the pros and cons of debate about the pros and cons of colonialism because colonialism because colonialism because colonialism was just colonialism was just as unimpeachably and evil as the as unimpeachably and evil as the Holocaust Holocaust Holocaust was there is was there is no you know balance here that you can no you know balance here that you can think about and think about well this is think about and think about well this is the outcome that happened you know we the outcome that happened you know we brought such and such things to the brought such and such things to the uncivilized Heathen and yes there were uncivilized Heathen and yes there were some things that happened a few some things that happened a few atrocities along the way that's the atrocities along the way that's the story I mean we have one of the most story I mean we have one of the most distinguished historians I have no idea distinguished historians I have no idea why he's so distinguished given the why he's so distinguished given the views that he has but NY Ferguson who views that he has but NY Ferguson who was an Oxford Dawn for a very long was an Oxford Dawn for a very long period of time before he moved on to period of time before he moved on to Harvard who is who has written over the Harvard who is who has written over the course of the last two to three decades course of the last two to three decades that on balance one can still speak that on balance one can still speak about the good that colonialism may have about the good that colonialism may have wrought in some instances that there wrought in some instances that there might well be a case that might be made might well be a case that might be made at least with regards to colonialism in at least with regards to colonialism in Africa if not let's say in Indonesia of Africa if not let's say in Indonesia of course it wasn't the British or in course it wasn't the British or in Indonesia but here I'm just looking at Indonesia but here I'm just looking at the European poers as a whole right so the European poers as a whole right so there are still people who hold to that there are still people who hold to that view and what I propose to do today is view and what I propose to do today is to in fact try to suggest that this is to in fact try to suggest that this is not a productive way of trying to not a productive way of trying to understand something called colonialism understand something called colonialism all right so let's go back if we can go all right so let's go back if we can go back to the beginning to the the the back to the beginning to the the the next slide have that please right okay next slide have that please right okay so this is this is essentially what I so this is this is essentially what I have have have suggested over here and I I will just suggested over here and I I will just elaborate on that for a moment before I elaborate on that for a moment before I go on to my 10 questions and cans so if go on to my 10 questions and cans so if you think about you think about colonialism and relationship the colonialism and relationship the Holocaust so one of the ideas that the Holocaust so one of the ideas that the Germans had was what they called Germans had was what they called leanr what is it that justifi German leanr what is it that justifi German expansion into the rest of Europe not expansion into the rest of Europe not into the rest of the world because bear into the rest of the world because bear in mind that the Germans came to in mind that the Germans came to colonialism late not because they were colonialism late not because they were more charitably inclined towards the more charitably inclined towards the African Amic an or anyone else but African Amic an or anyone else but Germany was not a unified country until Germany was not a unified country until the late 19th century and when Germany the late 19th century and when Germany did become a unified country one of the did become a unified country one of the first places that they occupied it was first places that they occupied it was about the only place in the world left about the only place in the world left to occupy was what became German to occupy was what became German Southwest Africa or what is now niia Southwest Africa or what is now niia where then the Germans proceeded to where then the Germans proceeded to perpetrate a massacre against the herero perpetrate a massacre against the herero and that was a laboratory because some and that was a laboratory because some of the methods that they of the methods that they used in Namibia what is now Namibia were used in Namibia what is now Namibia were then then then deployed against the deployed against the Jews we have to understand the Jews we have to understand the relationship relationship relationship between what Europe did to people between what Europe did to people outside and what it did to people within outside and what it did to people within the heart of Europe because what was the the heart of Europe because what was the Holocaust it was bringing the same Holocaust it was bringing the same worldview that formed worldview that formed colonialism it was bringing it into the colonialism it was bringing it into the heart of heart of heart of Europe that Heart of Darkness to use the Europe that Heart of Darkness to use the phase from Joseph phase from Joseph Conrad which was Africa that Heart of Conrad which was Africa that Heart of Darkness was Darkness was Darkness was Europe that is what the Holocaust Europe that is what the Holocaust Illustrated and if we want to think Illustrated and if we want to think about the Africans and the Indians and about the Africans and the Indians and the the the Indonesians as Savages which late 19th Indonesians as Savages which late 19th century European century European century European writers did so writers did so unly there are thousands of texts unly there are thousands of texts thousands of thousands of thousands of texts if we want to think of it then I texts if we want to think of it then I want to ask you all well who is it who want to ask you all well who is it who set up the concentration set up the concentration camps it wasn't the Africans it wasn't camps it wasn't the Africans it wasn't the Indians it wasn't the Indonesians it the Indians it wasn't the Indonesians it wasn't the ball wasn't the ball it was the Europeans who did it was the Europeans who did that that that right the use of forced right the use of forced labor let's not labor let's not forget the Concentration Camp Universe forget the Concentration Camp Universe most people have heard of outfits tra belic they were 1,000 concentration belic they were 1,000 concentration camps and the camps 1,000 concentration camps and the vast majority of them were labor camps vast majority of them were labor camps before they became extermination camps before they became extermination camps awit Buran now was producing more awit Buran now was producing more electricity than the city of Berlin that's what we're speaking about Berlin that's what we're speaking about and this same labor concept of unfree and this same labor concept of unfree labor is what colonialism was based on labor is what colonialism was based on all right so this so what I'm trying to all right so this so what I'm trying to suggest to you suggest to you is that this whole view that we should is that this whole view that we should have a kind of ambivalence about have a kind of ambivalence about colonialism I think this is not simply a colonialism I think this is not simply a deeply mistaken view it is a profoundly deeply mistaken view it is a profoundly immoral immoral immoral View and that is one reason I think we View and that is one reason I think we need to understand exactly what to come need to understand exactly what to come now more precisely to the British in now more precisely to the British in India exactly what transpired in India exactly what transpired in India all right so the first question is this is a question which question is this is a question which people in Britain do not often ask people in Britain do not often ask understandably but I want to begin with understandably but I want to begin with this question is a people that people in this question is a people that people in India India India ask how a few hundred later a few ask how a few hundred later a few thousand English men end up ruling such thousand English men end up ruling such a large country now this is a subject a large country now this is a subject obviously of a whole book and I could obviously of a whole book and I could speak on this for about 10 Hearts easily speak on this for about 10 Hearts easily right and and and and in this uh right and and and and in this uh PowerPoint slide I've just given you a PowerPoint slide I've just given you a few bullet points so that you have some few bullet points so that you have some sense of some of the arguments that I sense of some of the arguments that I been Advance because think of it this been Advance because think of it this way at the height of British rule in way at the height of British rule in India which I would put uh at India which I would put uh at approximately let's say 1880s I say the approximately let's say 1880s I say the height of British rule approximately height of British rule approximately 1880 so let's say just a little bit 1880 so let's say just a little bit before the time of pron is because in before the time of pron is because in 1857-58 there is a rebellion what used 1857-58 there is a rebellion what used to be known by the historians to be known by the historians particularly British historians as a SEO particularly British historians as a SEO community of 1857 I'm sure that many of community of 1857 I'm sure that many of you are familiar with it um and this you are familiar with it um and this rebellion was was crushed by the British rebellion was was crushed by the British I mean it was it was certainly a fight I mean it was it was certainly a fight to the Finish um and in uh in the to the Finish um and in uh in the aftermath of 1858 uh Victoria who was aftermath of 1858 uh Victoria who was the queen passed a proclamation saying the queen passed a proclamation saying that look there's been a great deal of that look there's been a great deal of animosity between our people and the animosity between our people and the people of India but now I propose to people of India but now I propose to treat my Indian subjects just as I treat treat my Indian subjects just as I treat my subjects over here in Britain right my subjects over here in Britain right that's the proclamation of Queen that's the proclamation of Queen Victoria and then from the late 1850s Victoria and then from the late 1850s moving into the early moving into the early 1880s what you're going to have is 1880s what you're going to have is you're going to have a period where you're going to have a period where you're going to see the expansion of the you're going to see the expansion of the railways you're going to see ation railways you're going to see ation projects in India you're going to see projects in India you're going to see the te the increase use of telegraph the the te the increase use of telegraph the founding of universities of the modern founding of universities of the modern Source right that's the period which is Source right that's the period which is known really as the period of Peace in known really as the period of Peace in some sense of the some sense of the term so the 1880s is is a period that we term so the 1880s is is a period that we can think of as a height of British rule can think of as a height of British rule at the height of British rule how many at the height of British rule how many Britains were there I'm using the word Britains were there I'm using the word Britains of course because in addition Britains of course because in addition to the English they were the Scots and to the English they were the Scots and there were the Irish right now how many there were the Irish right now how many were there at the height of it were there at the height of it including women and children including women and children 100,000 125,000 the armies of British India were 125,000 the armies of British India were staffed staffed staffed preponderantly by the preponderantly by the Indians not by the British only the Indians not by the British only the officers were the British they officers were the British they controlled the controlled the controlled the artillery and artillery and artillery and so for Indians the question always has so for Indians the question always has been how did just a handful so to speak been how did just a handful so to speak of Englishmen take control over a of Englishmen take control over a country which in the 1880s had a country which in the 1880s had a population of something in the population of something in the neighborhood of let's say about 175 neighborhood of let's say about 175 million million million right why didn't why didn't a million right why didn't why didn't a million people why didn't a million Indians just people why didn't a million Indians just sto for the parliament so to speak sto for the parliament so to speak metaphorically there was no parliament metaphorically there was no parliament in indiia right why did they just do in indiia right why did they just do that but of course it's the same that but of course it's the same question that could be asked of any question that could be asked of any people who were oppressed you know why people who were oppressed you know why did the Jews allow themselves to be led did the Jews allow themselves to be led like lamb like sheep to like lamb like sheep to slaughter slaughter slaughter right why did slavery persist for 3400 right why did slavery persist for 3400 years so I so that that's a question years so I so that that's a question that we can we can put in the abstract that we can we can put in the abstract and there but we if we are trying to and there but we if we are trying to understand what happened in the concrete understand what happened in the concrete then we have to understand the nature of then we have to understand the nature of hegemony which is very different than hegemony which is very different than domination right domination is what domination right domination is what dictators dictators dictators do and you might think to yourself ah do and you might think to yourself ah with a s of relief well finally I give with a s of relief well finally I give it some repri because the British were it some repri because the British were not dictators we being P well yeah but not dictators we being P well yeah but there many ways to there many ways to oppress now they so one of the ways in oppress now they so one of the ways in which you oppress is you put a which you oppress is you put a gun at a person's skull and say do this gun at a person's skull and say do this or that or I'm going to shoot you the or that or I'm going to shoot you the other is to be able to persuade in some other is to be able to persuade in some fashion and there is no question that fashion and there is no question that the British were extraordinarily the British were extraordinarily successful in creating a kind of successful in creating a kind of hey that is where they gained in some hey that is where they gained in some sense the sense the sense the consent of consent of consent of Indians to the rule the consent of Indians to the rule the consent of course was always backed by military course was always backed by military force that is what the rebellion of force that is what the rebellion of 1857 58 1857 58 1857 58 established that if you Rebel then there established that if you Rebel then there are consequences then we will are consequences then we will deploy the deploy the deploy the might our might the force that we have might our might the force that we have at our disposal and nothing will be at our disposal and nothing will be spit that is what the rebellion of spit that is what the rebellion of 1857-58 unly really established but when 1857-58 unly really established but when someone like jaar heru who is of course someone like jaar heru who is of course alongside Gandhi the most prominent alongside Gandhi the most prominent person in the Indian nationalist person in the Indian nationalist movement one of the two or three most movement one of the two or three most prominent people in 20th century prominent people in 20th century India when he writes a book which is India when he writes a book which is called the discovery of India that's called the discovery of India that's what the discovery is a reference to what the discovery is a reference to over here he speculates on this on this over here he speculates on this on this very question what is it that made it very question what is it that made it possible for so many for so few British possible for so many for so few British to rule over a country that is that L to rule over a country that is that L and he talks about he gives a number of and he talks about he gives a number of explanations the British were for explanations the British were for example more risk-taking the Indians example more risk-taking the Indians were ever to risk there was a or were ever to risk there was a or breakdown of organized power in India in breakdown of organized power in India in the 17th century the Bal Empire had the 17th century the Bal Empire had collapsed in 1707 the mol Emperor was collapsed in 1707 the mol Emperor was still sitting on the throne but at the still sitting on the throne but at the death of orange in 1707 the the Empire death of orange in 1707 the the Empire begins to slowly crumble right and this begins to slowly crumble right and this is always a problem with large Empires is always a problem with large Empires all over the world that at the all over the world that at the extremities Rebellion breaks out at the extremities Rebellion breaks out at the extremities um and then gradually it extremities um and then gradually it comes into the center right never talks comes into the center right never talks about the backwardness of the about the backwardness of the organization of Indian armies that the organization of Indian armies that the British represented a higher social British represented a higher social order the one of the explanations that order the one of the explanations that is commonly given that Indians were not is commonly given that Indians were not unified now I think there's some Merit unified now I think there's some Merit to all these observations I'm by no to all these observations I'm by no means means means suggesting that suggesting that suggesting that these arguments do not have any Merit these arguments do not have any Merit they all do but I want to suggest they all do but I want to suggest something else to you and what I want to something else to you and what I want to suggest to you if you go down to the suggest to you if you go down to the bottom of this slide is I want you to bottom of this slide is I want you to think about the question of think about the question of cosmopolitanism and cosmopolitanism and cosmopolitanism and provincialism and what I mean by that is provincialism and what I mean by that is the the the following that very often the story of following that very often the story of the n the story of the conquest of India the n the story of the conquest of India has been presented as a has been presented as a story of a European story of a European power which was Cosmopolitan power which was Cosmopolitan Cosmopolitan to the extent that one can Cosmopolitan to the extent that one can really think of cosmopolitanism among really think of cosmopolitanism among the among the the among the British and an island nation as British and an island nation as Churchill repeatedly Churchill repeatedly Churchill repeatedly reinforced and reinforced and reinforced and but obviously a world power by the 18th century so the story has been century so the story has been represented represented represented of an efficient modern organized of an efficient modern organized power confronting a people who were now power confronting a people who were now backward backward backward provincial now I want to suggest to you provincial now I want to suggest to you that we have to invert that we have to invert this we have because so this this H will this we have because so this this H will attempt to do many things it it Ventures attempt to do many things it it Ventures into some kind of theoretical ideas into some kind of theoretical ideas which uh I'm happy to explain at greater which uh I'm happy to explain at greater length but one of those ideas which I length but one of those ideas which I can only briefly advert to is what we can only briefly advert to is what we think of as cosmopolitism see one of the think of as cosmopolitism see one of the Perils of being Perils of being Cosmopolitan is that you open yourself Cosmopolitan is that you open yourself up you become up you become vulnerable because to be Cosmopolitan vulnerable because to be Cosmopolitan means to be willing to means to be willing to receive ideas to be willing to receive receive ideas to be willing to receive the forign now which civilization had an forign now which civilization had an experience with the experience with the Foreigner we have the next slide please Foreigner we have the next slide please right which civilization had an right which civilization had an experience with the if you look at the experience with the if you look at the history of history of history of India over the course of 2500 India over the course of 2500 years it is repeatedly streams of people years it is repeatedly streams of people coming into India either through the coming into India either through the kaiber PA through Northwest India or if kaiber PA through Northwest India or if you're looking at Peninsular India right you're looking at Peninsular India right the bottom portion of the country with a the bottom portion of the country with a long Coast long Coast long Coast Line East and Line East and West for example the coming of Islam how West for example the coming of Islam how did Islam come to did Islam come to India both through the KRA pass and India both through the KRA pass and through the through the through the sea right the Greeks came to India sea right the Greeks came to India there's a whole school of AR of there's a whole school of AR of sculpture the most gorgeous sculptures sculpture the most gorgeous sculptures you've ever seen of the Buddha the you've ever seen of the Buddha the kangara kangara kangara school what is this sculpture it's Indo school what is this sculpture it's Indo Greek foreigners were coming to India Greek foreigners were coming to India constantly and I'm not sure by the way constantly and I'm not sure by the way that most Indian languages even had a that most Indian languages even had a word for the word for the Foreigner for example in in colloquial Foreigner for example in in colloquial Hindi hindustani uru we use words such Hindi hindustani uru we use words such as Gora which simply means white as Gora which simply means white skin skin skin Gora right white skin fanii which is is Gora right white skin fanii which is is it an Indian word it is not not an it an Indian word it is not not an Indian Indian Indian word it's a Persian word it's a Persian word right the word right the fanki so what I'm trying to suggest is fanki so what I'm trying to suggest is this that when the British came to India this that when the British came to India and establish and establish and establish themselves they were no more themselves they were no more foreign to a Punjabi sitting in the foreign to a Punjabi sitting in the north then ailon would be to that north then ailon would be to that Punjabi see India is a land land of and Punjabi see India is a land land of and this is by the way after language loss this is by the way after language loss we have had considerable language we have had considerable language loss in India that is that there are loss in India that is that there are some languages which have disappeared some languages which have disappeared they become they become they become extinct right but India still has 800 extinct right but India still has 800 languages I'm not speaking about languages I'm not speaking about dialects if you include dialects it's dialects if you include dialects it's over 21,000 21,000 21,000 21,000 we have over 800 languages we 21,000 we have over 800 languages we have lost about 200 languages in the have lost about 200 languages in the course of the last 100 course of the last 100 years right now if you are a speaker of years right now if you are a speaker of tamilan South India you speaker of Korea tamilan South India you speaker of Korea Eastern India you are speaker of Eastern India you are speaker of kashmiri North kashmiri North kashmiri North India speaker of Hindi uru hindustani India speaker of Hindi uru hindustani little further south of Kashmir or guj little further south of Kashmir or guj Gujarati in Western India the Ora Gujarati in Western India the Ora speaker and the tamilan speaker and the speaker and the tamilan speaker and the speaker of Kashmir what do they have in speaker of Kashmir what do they have in common as languages go almost common as languages go almost nothing in fact the million is not even nothing in fact the million is not even an indoeuropean language English is a an indoeuropean language English is a Indo-European language it has more Indo-European language it has more Affinity to the languages of North India Affinity to the languages of North India than to some of the languages of Sou than to some of the languages of Sou India India India right so what I'm trying to suggest to right so what I'm trying to suggest to you is that when the English came to you is that when the English came to India in some ways the Indians treated India in some ways the Indians treated them just like they might treat any them just like they might treat any other other other Indian any other Indian and this Indian and this is a kind of cosmopolitism which was is a kind of cosmopolitism which was almost almost almost unmatched now let me give you a very unmatched now let me give you a very dramatic example of that and that is the dramatic example of that and that is the case of vajid Alisha all right who is case of vajid Alisha all right

don't believe me go to the if you don't believe me go to the British library catlog and look up how British library catlog and look up how many Works were written by R many Works were written by R Alisha what happened there was the Alisha what happened there was the defeat of a very defeat of a very Cosmopolitan ruler who did not do what Cosmopolitan ruler who did not do what you do in Western Europe and in Britain you do in Western Europe and in Britain you don't you don't you don't divide work and play it was a seamless life he did spend play it was a seamless life he did spend time with the subject we know that he time with the subject we know that he set aside a time when he listened to set aside a time when he listened to their complaints right but this is a very different way right but this is a very different way of thinking about the of thinking about the world and this is what the British were world and this is what the British were unable to comprehend see India unable to comprehend see India fundamentally remained opaque to the fundamentally remained opaque to the British because the English British because the English came not as settler came not as settler Colonials thankfully because if they Colonials thankfully because if they come as settler Colonials you know what come as settler Colonials you know what would have happened the widespread would have happened the widespread extermination as happened in Australia extermination as happened in Australia as happened in the United States that's as happened in the United States that's that's what we call Se colonialism which that's what we call Se colonialism which is based on is based on extermination of a extermination of a people they did not come as settler people they did not come as settler Colonials but when settler Colonials Colonials but when settler Colonials come what they also do is they put down come what they also do is they put down roots in many ways the British never put roots in many ways the British never put down down down Roots unlike the Muslims who came and Roots unlike the Muslims who came and who put out roots in India and who put out roots in India and created an Indo Islamic culture which is created an Indo Islamic culture which is unique in the world the only place in unique in the world the only place in the world where Islam had such a close the world where Islam had such a close relationship with an existing relationship with an existing civilization is under civilization is under Lu that's the only comparison you can Lu that's the only comparison you can think of because wherever Islam went think of because wherever Islam went Islam Islam Islam conquered you think about the country conquered you think about the country that are predominantly that that are that are predominantly that that are Muslim they are all Muslim they are all predominantly Muslim now you get of course countries Muslim now you get of course countries in Western Europe where you have small in Western Europe where you have small Muslim minorities including Britain but Muslim minorities including Britain but this is very recent if you're going back this is very recent if you're going back into the past the only example we have into the past the only example we have in history apart from Andalusia which in history apart from Andalusia which was only true until 1492 because in was only true until 1492 because in 1492 the Jews and the Muslims were 1492 the Jews and the Muslims were expelled expelled expelled from from from Andalusia right with the reconquest with Andalusia right with the reconquest with the Christian reconquest in India is the the Christian reconquest in India is the only place in the world where Islam only place in the world where Islam established an extraordinary established an extraordinary relationship with an existing relationship with an existing civilization and gave birth to a new civilization and gave birth to a new civilization which is the Indo Islamic civilization which is the Indo Islamic culture of South culture of South Asia Asia Asia right somebody like Al was a supreme right somebody like Al was a supreme representative of that representative of that Civilization all right if we could just Civilization all right if we could just move on move on move on to question number two I'll be shorter to question number two I'll be shorter in my in my other questions and in my in my other questions and considerations an argument we frequently considerations an argument we frequently encounter people love to give this encounter people love to give this argument when they're saying oh you know argument when they're saying oh you know well the British did do some the English well the British did do some the English develop India really I want to know develop India really I want to know let's see the next slide and I want to let's see the next slide and I want to explain to you over explain to you over here that L someone should think of here that L someone should think of me as arguing from the standpoint of an me as arguing from the standpoint of an Indian nationalist which I'm not because I nationalist which I'm not because I can't get into the details of what my can't get into the details of what my views are of the present government of views are of the present government of India for example all India for example all right all the data that I'm giving to right all the data that I'm giving to you is from British you is from British historians not from Indian historians not from Indian historians this is a historians this is a slide a chart from Angus medicine who slide a chart from Angus medicine who was a professor of Economics at no was a professor of Economics at no lesser an institution than lesser an institution than Cambridge all right I don't need to tell Cambridge all right I don't need to tell you all the place of Cambridge and you all the place of Cambridge and Oxford in the life of the United Oxford in the life of the United Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom okay and if you look at this you see okay and if you look at this you see India let's look at India over there so India let's look at India over there so in the in the in the orange approximately the year 1 2,000 orange approximately the year 1 2,000 years ago according to of course you years ago according to of course you have to extrapolate from sources because have to extrapolate from sources because we didn't keep you know data to that we didn't keep you know data to that degree but you read for example what the degree but you read for example what the Roman historians wrote about the trade Roman historians wrote about the trade with IND right so that's how you know with IND right so that's how you know the extrapolations of course when you the extrapolations of course when you get into the 1500s and thereafter the get into the 1500s and thereafter the economic data is much richer and by 1600 economic data is much richer and by 1600 1700 a lot of people think that the 1700 a lot of people think that the British were unique in bringing British were unique in bringing statistics to India completely statistics to India completely false of course modern statistics in a false of course modern statistics in a way but the MS were uous statistics way but the MS were uous statistics keepers of Statistics we have a huge keepers of Statistics we have a huge amount of economic data from the M amount of economic data from the M Empire now but let's not get back to the Empire now but let's not get back to the year one let's take the year year one let's take the year 1,500 you see that India was according 1,500 you see that India was according to Angus Madison to Angus Madison India accounted for 32% of the world's GDP and even in GDP 32% of the world's GDP and even in the year 1700 if you look over there you the year 1700 if you look over there you will see that will see that India India India China and Western Europe put together China and Western Europe put together including including including Britain roughly accounted each of them Britain roughly accounted each of them for 1/3 each of the world's GDP how much did India account GDP how much did India account for you you go down to 950 over here for you you go down to 950 over here right 1947 is when India acquires right 1947 is when India acquires Independence Independence Independence about 2.2% of the world's GDP okay about 2.2% of the world GDP okay about 2.2% of the world GDP India became so impoverished under GDP India became so impoverished under British British British rule and I can tell you that there are rule and I can tell you that there are English English English sources just read the works of Simon bck sources just read the works of Simon bck for for for example okay look at what some of the example okay look at what some of the British who were critical of what British who were critical of what Britain was doing in India the levels of Britain was doing in India the levels of Taxation that were imposed upon the Taxation that were imposed upon the population of India if you look at the population of India if you look at the world's GDP here now this is not in the world's GDP here now this is not in the form of a obviously a um a graph there form of a obviously a um a graph there this is a a chart here where you have this is a a chart here where you have 1,700 so what we're talking about here 1,700 so what we're talking about here is Britain is accounting for is Britain is accounting for 2.88% of the world's GD GP and by 1870 2.88% of the world's GD GP and by 1870 it's gone up to 9.1 Europe Western it's gone up to 9.1 Europe Western Europe is 33.610991 for example the annexation of 33.610991 for example the annexation of Punjab that's 1830s 1840s early 1840s Punjab that's 1830s 1840s early 1840s we're talking about we're talking about right by by the right by by the 1840s those military Wars of expansion 1840s those military Wars of expansion were largely over you did have were largely over you did have annexation the kingdom of abat which I I annexation the kingdom of abat which I I shared with you a slide of the ruler of shared with you a slide of the ruler of abat 1856 the British absorb AB into abat 1856 the British absorb AB into British India but that was not your British India but that was not your military expansion military expansion military expansion right they had they had various other right they had they had various other ways in which they enlarged their territ ways in which they enlarged their territ territories in India but the point territories in India but the point should be ally clear to you that if you should be ally clear to you that if you look at the economic data what we find look at the economic data what we find is that India went from being the is that India went from being the wealthiest country in the world along wealthiest country in the world along with with with China to being unquestionably the most China to being unquestionably the most impoverished country bar possibly of impoverished country bar possibly of course a few countries in Africa you course a few countries in Africa you know but given the stature of India in know but given the stature of India in the world the world the world economy and someone like Ken to speak of economy and someone like Ken to speak of the the Spectre of this the the Spectre of this place right someone like C was well place right someone like C was well aware of the implications of having aware of the implications of having India this Slide by the way I was at the India this Slide by the way I was at the Imperial War Museum in London day before Imperial War Museum in London day before yesterday and I found this there I said yesterday and I found this there I said hey this is a nice s to add to my hey this is a nice s to add to my PowerPoint here right as long as we Ru PowerPoint here right as long as we Ru India we are the greatest town in the India we are the greatest town in the world if we lose it we should drop world if we lose it we should drop straight away to a third rate power the power the power the viceo of viceo of viceo of India the cabinet in London they understood exact L why India was the the understood exact L why India was the the Jew in the Jew in the CR CR CR right and I want to be certain that you right and I want to be certain that you at least understand whether you agree at least understand whether you agree with it or not and if you don't agree with it or not and if you don't agree with it you'll have to give me good with it you'll have to give me good reason for why you don't agree with it reason for why you don't agree with it because there is unimpeachable economic because there is unimpeachable economic data that and medison is only one of data that and medison is only one of many people who has now come up with many people who has now come up with these figures these figures these figures right you'd have to explain why right you'd have to explain why why India descended to descended to descended to becoming an extraordinarily impoverished becoming an extraordinarily impoverished country a country of country a country of destitution right and of destitution right and of course this is Rel this point here is course this is Rel this point here is related the English I want to suggest related the English I want to suggest you that what happened was that far from you that what happened was that far from developing India the English actually developing India the English actually underdeveloped in there is a story of underdeveloped in there is a story of faits that's it's a very different story faits that's it's a very different story than the one that has been told in this than the one that has been told in this country because the story that has been country because the story that has been told here is well we went there and we told here is well we went there and we prevented faits we presented famines you know faits we presented famines you know British rule British rule British rule started with a famine a famine of such started with a famine a famine of such magnitude that it's almost too horrific magnitude that it's almost too horrific to even described the British conquest to even described the British conquest of B gold led to the decimation of 1/3 of B gold led to the decimation of 1/3 of the population in 2 years 10 million of the population in 2 years 10 million people died in people died in the and the and the and again go to a again go to a British don't take the word of an Indian British don't take the word of an Indian if you think that scholarship is if you think that scholarship is partisan sometimes it is I'm not going partisan sometimes it is I'm not going to pretend it isn't I would certainly to pretend it isn't I would certainly like to claim that I don't do it but I'm like to claim that I don't do it but I'm I'm aware of the fact that scholarship I'm aware of the fact that scholarship is is is partis right even though Scholars like partis right even though Scholars like to pretend that it isn't but that's I'm to pretend that it isn't but that's I'm saying go to the prous saying go to the prous stories read William D's book The stories read William D's book The Anarchy that's what it's called the Anarchy that's what it's called the Anarchy it's the fourth book of his quet Anarchy it's the fourth book of his quet where he where he where he describes the describes the describes the Anarchy in the wake of the British Anarchy in the wake of the British conquest of Bal and 10 million people K conquest of Bal and 10 million people K and British R is bookended why is it and British R is bookended why is it bookended because because bookended because because 1943 you have the great Bal famine 3 1943 you have the great Bal famine 3 million people million people million people died and while Indians were starving died and while Indians were starving food was being exported from India by food was being exported from India by the British for their troops and for the British for their troops and for Australian troops a fundamental reevaluation of troops a fundamental reevaluation of Winston church is required in this Winston church is required in this country I can tell you something that is country I can tell you something that is going to be almost impossible to do given the larger and life status that he given the larger and life status that he has obviously the absolute veneration of has obviously the absolute veneration of course well over the fact that he lost course well over the fact that he lost the election after the war well some the election after the war well some people still try to understand why that people still try to understand why that happened but we won't get into British happened but we won't get into British history here right now and I I'm aware history here right now and I I'm aware of the fact that they're critics of of the fact that they're critics of church are here too but they're critics church are here too but they're critics of him with an unawareness other the of him with an unawareness other the most part of what Churchill brought in most part of what Churchill brought in India because that man was so profoundly India because that man was so profoundly racist that it is almost difficult to racist that it is almost difficult to breathe when you are in the company of breathe when you are in the company of Winston Winston Winston Church there's just no question about Church there's just no question about that one writing after another of his on that one writing after another of his on India and Africa just shows the profound India and Africa just shows the profound racism in which he was racism in which he was drenched you know drenched you know right and and that is precisely why the right and and that is precisely why the export of food from India in 1943 was export of food from India in 1943 was possible because he did not care for the possible because he did not care for the lives of people in that part of the lives of people in that part of the world and that is why I go back to the world and that is why I go back to the proposition I started with that proposition I started with that proposition was think about the idea of proposition was think about the idea of freedom as being freedom as being indivisible how that church really think indivisible how that church really think of Freedom that's what I would really of Freedom that's what I would really want to know the period from 187 1875 to want to know the period from 187 1875 to 1925 was a period of catastrophic death 1925 was a period of catastrophic death in India in India in India catastrophic all right I mean about 100 catastrophic all right I mean about 100 million million million people 100 million excess people 100 million excess TS that's because because so you know TS that's because because so you know excess T is very important I'm sure that excess T is very important I'm sure that all of you in the wake of Co know all of you in the wake of Co know exactly what I'm talking about that you exactly what I'm talking about that you have an ordinary mortality rate and then have an ordinary mortality rate and then because of Co the mortality rate and because of Co the mortality rate and virtually every country went virtually every country went up right so when it goes beyond the up right so when it goes beyond the ordinary that's excess debts we're ordinary that's excess debts we're speaking about 100 million excess debts speaking about 100 million excess debts in India from 1875 to 1925 look at the in India from 1875 to 1925 look at the census Reports look at the decline of census Reports look at the decline of the population look at the census of the population look at the census of 1911 1921 not all of it from famines a 1911 1921 not all of it from famines a good deal from famines because the good deal from famines because the policy that the English pursued in India policy that the English pursued in India was akin to the policy that they P was akin to the policy that they P pursued in pursued in pursued in Ireland which led to the Great Potato Ireland which led to the Great Potato Famine which was a policy of GL Famine which was a policy of GL Fair leave it to the market the Fair leave it to the market the invisible hat of Adam Smith the free invisible hat of Adam Smith the free market will take care of all of these market will take care of all of these problems problems problems right and do you know what life right and do you know what life expectancy in India was according to the expectancy in India was according to the 1941 census taken by the 1941 census taken by the British right the life expectancy in British right the life expectancy in India in India in India in 1941 was 27 27 27 27 in India it is 65 27 in India it is 65 today and in today and in 1941 when the life expectancy was 27 in 1941 when the life expectancy was 27 in India it was India it was 55 the in Great Britain what percentage of the Britain what percentage of the population of India was literate since population of India was literate since the British claimed that they had the British claimed that they had introduced formal education and all of introduced formal education and all of that that that 11% was the literacy rate in India in 1941 so the British developed India or 1941 so the British developed India or they underdeveloped India that's a they underdeveloped India that's a question to question to question to ask the British brought technology ask the British brought technology Railways to India my first question is Railways to India my first question is so what so what if they brought Railways I mean at some point in time a Railways I mean at some point in time a technology comes to a Nation about 10 50 technology comes to a Nation about 10 50 minutes right what of course we have to minutes right what of course we have to ask what were the railways used for ask what were the railways used for British documents are very clear about British documents are very clear about this this this 1843 the first line set up in India in 1843 the first line set up in India in Western India and what is a place called Western India and what is a place called T which is in the proximity of Bombay T which is in the proximity of Bombay right that the railways were going to be right that the railways were going to be useful for comments for military useful for comments for military purposes you have a rebellion making in purposes you have a rebellion making in one part of India you need to send one part of India you need to send troops you can do it much more quickly troops you can do it much more quickly with the with the with the railways the railways investors who put money into railways investors who put money into the railways will the railways will guarantee uh double the return from guarantee uh double the return from anything else anything else anything else and all of this came from what is called and all of this came from what is called the home charges so you know the home the home charges so you know the home charges is so let's say you have a BRI charges is so let's say you have a BRI civil servant who's worked in civil servant who's worked in India for four India for four decades they retired who pays their decades they retired who pays their money is it the British money is it the British government government government no it's a government of no it's a government of India it's a that is Indian India it's a that is Indian taxes are going to be used taxes are going to be used for that and the for that and the Investments here for the railways are Investments here for the railways are all home all home all home charges to get an idea of how the charges to get an idea of how the British economy work in India British economy work in India okay question five didn't Britain stitch okay question five didn't Britain stitch together a nation when one didn't exist together a nation when one didn't exist before right one of the one of the most before right one of the most fundamental CLS might made by the fundamental CLS might made by the British is we created a country where British is we created a country where there was a one before all you have was there was a one before all you have was you have tamilans and balies and and you have tamilans and balies and and rajs and bengalis punjabis all at each rajs and bengalis punjabis all at each other's throats Muslims Hindus siks other's throats Muslims Hindus siks Christians all at each other's throats Christians all at each other's throats we created a nation where one didn't we created a nation where one didn't exist and I'm actually being charitable exist and I'm actually being charitable enough to say how is is both enough to say how is is both true and simultaneously fundamentally true and simultaneously fundamentally false it is true in the sense this will false it is true in the sense this will take very long to elaborate but I'll put take very long to elaborate but I'll put it as a proposition to you you you Hindus right India is leave aside Nepal Hindus right India is leave aside Nepal which is very small country and used to which is very small country and used to be part of Greater India at one point in be part of Greater India at one point in remote Integrity India is the only remote Integrity India is the only country in the world that is country in the world that is predominantly Hindu 79 9% of the predominantly Hindu 79 9% of the population of India is population of India is Hindu well the British created Hindus they created Hindus there was no Hindus they created Hindus there was no such thing as a such thing as a Hindu they were vavas they were shites Hindu they were vavas they were shites they were shos they were panri the word Hindu is not an Indian panri the word Hindu is not an Indian word it comes from Arabic and word it comes from Arabic and Persian no Hindu ever described himself Persian no Hindu ever described himself or herself as a Hindu in India for 2,000 or herself as a Hindu in India for 2,000 years the British literally created years the British literally created Hinduism in a Hinduism in a way the invention of way the invention of Hinduism and I can and maybe during the Hinduism and I can and maybe during the Q&amp;A I can explain a little bit more of Q&amp;A I can explain a little bit more of what is meant by that but in that what is meant by that but in that sense the British sense the British did create a nation of Hindus that's did create a nation of Hindus that's what I mean that in some ways it is true what I mean that in some ways it is true not the true in the way in which they not the true in the way in which they meant it because when the British said meant it because when the British said Rec created a country that didn't exist Rec created a country that didn't exist before what they meant was we created a before what they meant was we created a country with political Unity well there country with political Unity well there was political Unity under the bals the was political Unity under the bals the Bal Empire covered as much area as did Bal Empire covered as much area as did British British British India the empire under aoka under the India the empire under aoka under the Warriors covered as Warriors covered as much of territory as the Great much of territory as the Great India so if that's a name that name is India so if that's a name that name is in fact Incorrect and of course we can in fact Incorrect and of course we can think about a pan Indian Unity that think about a pan Indian Unity that existed that the god Vishnu was existed that the god Vishnu was worshiped in all parts of the country worshiped in all parts of the country for at least 1500 years the god Shiva for at least 1500 years the god Shiva was worshiped in all parts of India for was worshiped in all parts of India
