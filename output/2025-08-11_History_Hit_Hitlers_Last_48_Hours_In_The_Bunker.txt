So, we're a couple her own life as well. So, we're a couple of years after that. After Ava's second of years after that. After Ava's second attempt, Hitler decides to make her his attempt, Hitler decides to make her his official mistress, which means she's official mistress, which means she's still living in secret, but the people still living in secret, but the people immediately around him know about her. immediately around him know about her.

While Hitler's sleeping, let's just While Hitler's sleeping, let's just check in on on the rest of the war. check in on on the rest of the war. Mousolini, the puppet leader of the Mousolini, the puppet leader of the Italian state in Northern Italy, the Italian state in Northern Italy, the fascist state, has been killed, as you fascist state, has been killed, as you mentioned. He's been strung up. His mentioned. He's been strung up. His body's been abused. That's the end of of body's been abused. That's the end of of Hitler's great axis ally. What's Hitler's great axis ally. What's happening? The allies advancing from the happening? The allies advancing from the west. west. west. Allies are advancing from the west. Allies are advancing from the west. George Orwell is with one of the George Orwell is with one of the American battalions as a journalist for American battalions as a journalist for the Observer and he's very struck by how the Observer and he's very struck by how the Germans are very very keen to get the Germans are very very keen to get into the Allied territories, into the Allied territories, particularly the Americans and the and particularly the Americans and the and the British. So he says that your the British. So he says that your average German, they just plain don't average German, they just plain don't like the French, but they're really like the French, but they're really scared of the Russians. And so there's scared of the Russians. And so there's this across the whole of Germany, like this across the whole of Germany, like millions of people are moving west. And millions of people are moving west. And there's very little confidence that the there's very little confidence that the Western Alliance will hold because when Western Alliance will hold because when the Americans get somewhere, they put up the Americans get somewhere, they put up an American flag. When the British get an American flag. When the British get somewhere, they put up a British flag. somewhere, they put up a British flag. So the German people are really So the German people are really suspicious that the whole country is suspicious that the whole country is going to be divided between these going to be divided between these countries countries countries going be partitioned. And in meanwhile going be partitioned. And in meanwhile the the Soviets in Berlin are fighting the the Soviets in Berlin are fighting room to room, house to house, committing room to room, house to house, committing atrocities as they go. I mean it must atrocities as they go. I mean it must have just been a horrific battlefield have just been a horrific battlefield raging above Hitler as he slept. raging above Hitler as he slept. Yeah, absolutely. Bombs going off the Yeah, absolutely. Bombs going off the whole time. There are in tanks coming whole time. There are in tanks coming over enormous amounts of rubble.

So, one is to find Hitler and arrest him. one is to find Hitler and arrest him. Stalin is very keen that Hitler be taken Stalin is very keen that Hitler be taken alive. And then the other um and it kind alive. And then the other um and it kind of seems very modern is to get a photo of seems very modern is to get a photo opportunity. And that photo opportunity opportunity. And that photo opportunity is to get the Russian flag on top of the is to get the Russian flag on top of the German parliament. The Reich stag. It's German parliament. The Reich stag. It's a major mission and those who are a major mission and those who are defending Berlin are are well aware of defending Berlin are are well aware of this. Of these very few defenders left, this.

Their viral moment. Their viral moment. Ideally, Stalin would like to see that Ideally, Stalin would like to see that flag in time for Mayday. flag in time for Mayday. All right, Emma, it's mid morning. What All right, Emma, it's mid morning. What kind of time does Hitler wake up? He kind of time does Hitler wake up? He gets up about 11. Okay. He's kind of got gets up about 11. Okay. He's kind of got a routine of getting dressed. Kind of a routine of getting dressed. Kind of little game that he plays every day with little game that he plays every day with his valet where they do it to a his valet where they do it to a stopwatch. But this morning, the valet stopwatch. But this morning, the valet can see immediately that Hitler has can see immediately that Hitler has actually slept in his clothes. So, actually slept in his clothes. So, there's not much getting dressed to be there's not much getting dressed to be done. His barber comes in and trims his done. His barber comes in and trims his mustache. He's very self-conscious about mustache. He's very self-conscious about his unusually large nostrils, which is his unusually large nostrils, which is apparently the reason for the covering. apparently the reason for the covering. He takes his medications. Just before He takes his medications. Just before he's woken up, the bunker has heard from he's woken up, the bunker has heard from a Hitler Youth Courier that the Russians a Hitler Youth Courier that the Russians are now only 500 yards away. General are now only 500 yards away. General Krebs is is on the telephone when the Krebs is is on the telephone when the line suddenly goes dead. And the radio line suddenly goes dead. And the radio and telephone communications have been and telephone communications have been provided up to this point by a hot air provided up to this point by a hot air balloon and that's just been shot down. balloon and that's just been shot down. So from now on, the bunker has the only So from now on, the bunker has the only communication with the outside world is communication with the outside world is by telegram and Korea. by telegram and Korea. So Hitler's getting dressed. What's his So Hitler's getting dressed. What's his what's what's the next move? what's what's the next move? Hitler has always loved dogs. And he had Hitler has always loved dogs. And he had a dog with him in the trenches in the a dog with him in the trenches in the First World War called Fox. And his First World War called Fox. And his Alsatian in the bunker with him, Alsatian in the bunker with him, Blondie, has just had six puppies, one Blondie, has just had six puppies, one of whom is called Fox. and that's his of whom is called Fox. and that's his favorite puppy. And he calls for this favorite puppy. And he calls for this new little foxle to come so he can play new little foxle to come so he can play with him. Up in the upper bunker, the with him. Up in the upper bunker, the Gerbles children are playing in the Gerbles children are playing in the corridor. It's about this time, I think, corridor. It's about this time, I think, that Trudel Younger observed this that Trudel Younger observed this difference between the children. So, the difference between the children. So, the five youngest children are completely five youngest children are completely happy. They totally accept their happy. They totally accept their parents' story that there's about to be parents' story that there's about to be victory. It's all very exciting. victory. It's all very exciting. But Younger says, "But sometimes I But Younger says, "But sometimes I thought that Helga, the oldest, had this thought that Helga, the oldest, had this deep sad expression in her eyes and that deep sad expression in her eyes and that she alone of the children knew what was she alone of the children knew what was going on." going on." going on." So Hitler's playing with his dog. What's So Hitler's playing with his dog. What's going on elsewhere? I mentioned earlier going on elsewhere? I mentioned earlier that that kind of some of the younger that that kind of some of the younger officers were kind of really taking on officers were kind of really taking on board the situation and wondering how board the situation and wondering how they could get out alive. And three of they could get out alive. And three of these officers, their names are Bolt, these officers, their names are Bolt, Vice, and Von Luring Haven, worked out a Vice, and Von Luring Haven, worked out a plan to escape from the bunker. They're plan to escape from the bunker. They're very nervous about proposing it because very nervous about proposing it because if it goes wrong, they know they could if it goes wrong, they know they could be called out as traitors and shot. They be called out as traitors and shot. They first of all suggest to Krebs and it and first of all suggest to Krebs and it and it goes up the line and they get the S it goes up the line and they get the S that they go and support General Wena that they go and support General Wena who is supposedly who is supposedly maintaining a route in and out of maintaining a route in and out of Berlin. right through the Russian Berlin. right through the Russian encirclement. The reality is that encirclement. The reality is that Vanker's line is collapsing and it's all Vanker's line is collapsing and it's all it's all beyond hope and and they know it's all beyond hope and and they know that really. But Hitler, that really. But Hitler, he's got this double thing going on. On he's got this double thing going on. On the one hand, he's there to die. He the one hand, he's there to die. He knows it's the end. But on the other knows it's the end. But on the other hand, he he grasps at straws of hope. So hand, he he grasps at straws of hope. So they say, "We could be more used to they say, "We could be more used to Vener. Do you know we could go and fight Vener. Do you know we could go and fight with him?" and they're absolutely with him?" and they're absolutely delighted that this plan is accepted. delighted that this plan is accepted.

And the kind of bit of that that people And the kind of bit of that that people are always interested in is the sort of are always interested in is the sort of the sex angle of that. But what strikes the sex angle of that. But what strikes me actually is the fact that the dentist me actually is the fact that the dentist chair had straps. And the reason the chair had straps. And the reason the dentist chair has got straps is because dentist chair has got straps is because they're extracting teeth and doing all they're extracting teeth and doing all the things dentists do.

I'm guessing that the the extremely bad. I'm guessing that the the Soviets have only, you know, got closer. Soviets have only, you know, got closer. They're about 250 yards away, perhaps They're about 250 yards away, perhaps less. He's told there's they've probably less. He's told there's they've probably got 24 more hours. That's the kind of got 24 more hours. That's the kind of the pace of getting through Berlin. the pace of getting through Berlin. That's extreme. That's actually given That's extreme. That's actually given that they're so close, that seems like a that they're so close, that seems like a long time. long time. long time. I know. I know. I know. As the sun comes up, presumably that As the sun comes up, presumably that assault on the rice dug really really assault on the rice dug really really heats up. heats up. heats up. It's very violent. It's the thing that It's very violent. It's the thing that that the Germans are defending. So about that the Germans are defending. So about 5,000 troops there. There's Hitler 5,000 troops there.

What's going on? What's the picture? What's going on? What's the picture? Well, Ava wakes up and she's probably Well, Ava wakes up and she's probably the most steadfast person, I'd say, in the most steadfast person, I'd say, in the bunker. She's so clear about what the bunker. She's so clear about what she's doing. There are no reports about she's doing. There are no reports about her having kind of last minute panic, her having kind of last minute panic, second thoughts, desperate hopes. But second thoughts, desperate hopes. But she decides that she wants to see the she decides that she wants to see the sun one last time. She knows she's going sun one last time. She knows she's going to die today. So she goes up the stairs to die today. So she goes up the stairs to the right chancery garden and very to the right chancery garden and very briefly looks out at this devastated briefly looks out at this devastated site. The chancery buildings have been site. The chancery buildings have been very badly bombed and are shells and the very badly bombed and are shells and the garden is pitted with craters. The garden is pitted with craters. The battle is raging all around them. battle is raging all around them. constant artillery bombardment. So she constant artillery bombardment. So she has this brief moment where she hardly has this brief moment where she hardly does see the sun, comes back downstairs does see the sun, comes back downstairs and then Hitler decides to follow her and then Hitler decides to follow her example, which in itself is a kind of example, which in itself is a kind of real turnaround of what their real turnaround of what their relationship has been like. and he goes relationship has been like. and he goes up the stairs, but when he gets to the up the stairs, but when he gets to the top of the stairs, the sound of the top of the stairs, the sound of the bombs is so loud that he doesn't even bombs is so loud that he doesn't even open the door and and he comes back open the door and and he comes back down. down. down. Extraordinary moment that cuz Hitler and Extraordinary moment that cuz Hitler and Eve have been at the heart in a way at Eve have been at the heart in a way at the center of the greatest war in human the center of the greatest war in human history history history and this is the first time they've and this is the first time they've experienced experienced experienced direct fire themselves. You know, it's direct fire themselves. You know, it's fascinating, isn't it? fascinating, isn't it? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. What's everyone else doing in the bunker What's everyone else doing in the bunker first thing in the morning? Gerbal's first thing in the morning? Gerbal's children are having breakfast. Trudal children are having breakfast. Trudal young are on duty again. young are on duty again. They're loving their bread and jam. They're loving their bread and jam. They're loving their bread.

A lot of leading Nazis make a lot of use of kind of wellness clinics and of use of kind of wellness clinics and she has been suffering from stress and she has been suffering from stress and she has a heart condition and she now she has a heart condition and she now she just spends most of her time yeah she just spends most of her time yeah lying in bed. lying in bed. What else should we be aware of in the What else should we be aware of in the wider allied war effort? We mentioned wider allied war effort? We mentioned earlier Churchill is doing a lot of work earlier Churchill is doing a lot of work from his bed and he's sitting in bed from his bed and he's sitting in bed surrounded by papers giving dictation surrounded by papers giving dictation secretary in the room and smoking a secretary in the room and smoking a cigar and the secretary suddenly she's cigar and the secretary suddenly she's you typing away looks up and realizes you typing away looks up and realizes that the ash from his cigar has set fire that the ash from his cigar has set fire to his lapel and actually the smoke from to his lapel and actually the smoke from it is so bad another secretary John Peek it is so bad another secretary John Peek actually comes into the room from the actually comes into the room from the car. You can smell it out in the car. You can smell it out in the corridor. They say, "Oh, I uh do you corridor. They say, "Oh, I uh do you know I need to you're on fire. I need to know I need to you're on fire. I need to put the fire out." And Churchill uh is put the fire out." And Churchill uh is kind of fine, fine. But he hasn't even kind of fine, fine. But he hasn't even noticed. And so just a marvelously noticed. And so just a marvelously telling moment about how Churchill telling moment about how Churchill operated. such an interesting contrast operated. such an interesting contrast between these two leaders that Churchill between these two leaders that Churchill is a person who is respected by those is a person who is respected by those who work for him, but they find him who work for him, but they find him quite difficult. You know, he loses his quite difficult. You know, he loses his temper. He's kind of you can't get temper. He's kind of you can't get through to him and then he's suddenly through to him and then he's suddenly sort of shouting about something or sort of shouting about something or whatever. Hitler, by contrast, he's whatever. Hitler, by contrast, he's famous for his tempers, but he very famous for his tempers, but he very rarely loses his temper with his rarely loses his temper with his subordinates. So people who are high up subordinates. So people who are high up in the military or in the Nazi party, in the military or in the Nazi party, they can be a threat. He can be very they can be a threat. He can be very angry with them. There's this pattern angry with them. There's this pattern where he he adores dogs, he adores where he he adores dogs, he adores animals, and he adores women who for him animals, and he adores women who for him are in a kind of slightly similar are in a kind of slightly similar category to the to the animals. He adors category to the to the animals. He adors children. He loves the Gerbles children children. He loves the Gerbles children being there. You know, they cheer him up being there. You know, they cheer him up every day. And in return, the people every day. And in return, the people that work for him all adore him. And I that work for him all adore him. And I think that is one of the kind of think that is one of the kind of strangest things. But he is personally strangest things. But he is personally very kind and considerate to those very kind and considerate to those people that he knows firmly he is in people that he knows firmly he is in control of. He's very kind to his dogs. control of. He's very kind to his dogs. Whereas Churchill's operating more like Whereas Churchill's operating more like a person who hasn't got some kind of a person who hasn't got some kind of warped agenda. He's just doing his job warped agenda. He's just doing his job and finding it difficult. Whereas yeah, and finding it difficult. Whereas yeah, Hitler is so comfortable when he's in Hitler is so comfortable when he's in control of people. Right. control of people. Right. Midday on the 30th. Berlin's on fire. It Midday on the 30th. Berlin's on fire. It sounds like Church is on fire as well in sounds like Church is on fire as well in more ways than one. What is going on in more ways than one. What is going on in the bunker? What's going with Hitler? the bunker? What's going with Hitler? Well, there's more bad news coming. One Well, there's more bad news coming. One of Hitler's generals, Vidling. He's very of Hitler's generals, Vidling.

It's a black dress with kind of white It's a black dress with kind of white roses around the neck. Hitler sits down roses around the neck. Hitler sits down for this last meal. He's got this very for this last meal. He's got this very delicate stomach. And this final meal is delicate stomach. And this final meal is plain spaghetti and a salad made of plain spaghetti and a salad made of cabbage and raisins. As is typical, he cabbage and raisins.

And as he sees it, the world to come. And as he sees it, there will be a period in which people there will be a period in which people say terrible things about them all, but say terrible things about them all, but in the long run, their greatness will be in the long run, their greatness will be recognized. So the kind of long-term recognized. So the kind of long-term legacy will be of, you know, legacy will be of, you know, appreciation and and and they will appreciation and and and they will return to the heroic status that that return to the heroic status that that they see themselves to have. they see themselves to have. That that day is yet to dawn, That that day is yet to dawn, thankfully. Uh yes, we luckily haven't thankfully. Uh yes, we luckily haven't got there. Sit's having lunch. Are any of Sit's having lunch. Are any of instructions being actually carried out, instructions being actually carried out, the ones he's been giving over the last the ones he's been giving over the last few hours? few hours? few hours? Yes. So he'd instructed Durnit to arrest Yes. So he'd instructed Durnit to arrest Himmler. So Dernitz calls Himmler to Himmler. So Dernitz calls Himmler to come and visit him. Himmler's kind of come and visit him. Himmler's kind of thinking, how do I play my cards right thinking, how do I play my cards right here? On the one hand, he recognizes here? On the one hand, he recognizes that this could be a very dangerous that this could be a very dangerous moment, that Dernitz could have moment, that Dernitz could have instructions to kill him. On the other instructions to kill him. On the other hand, he's thinking Hitler's over. You hand, he's thinking Hitler's over. You know, Dernets could be the man of the know, Dernets could be the man of the future. I want to be in with him. So, he future. I want to be in with him.

Ava Brawn is with him. She says goodbye Ava Brawn is with him. She says goodbye to Trala, the secretary, and she advises to Trala, the secretary, and she advises her same message, get to the west. She her same message, get to the west. She says to Trudel Younger, "Give my best to says to Trudel Younger, "Give my best to Bavaria." She's very composed. And this Bavaria." She's very composed. And this is in contrast to Magda Gerbles. So is in contrast to Magda Gerbles. So Magda Gerbles has been this very Magda Gerbles has been this very powerful woman in Germany. Hitler, the powerful woman in Germany. Hitler, the apparent bachelor, has often kind of apparent bachelor, has often kind of taken Magda as his sort of companion to taken Magda as his sort of companion to open things or give speeches or open things or give speeches or whatever, whilst Ava's been sort of whatever, whilst Ava's been sort of hidden. hidden. hidden. So, she's sort of an unofficial first So, she's sort of an unofficial first lady. She's been like an unofficial lady. She's been like an unofficial first lady and the power dynamic between first lady and the power dynamic between her and Ava Brawn has been very much her and Ava Brawn has been very much Magda is older and Ava's this kind of Magda is older and Ava's this kind of nervous little girl. But here it swaps nervous little girl. But here it swaps and Ava's completely calm and Magda has and Ava's completely calm and Magda has this panic. And when Ava and Hitler this panic. And when Ava and Hitler withdraw to his study for the final withdraw to his study for the final time, Magda suddenly has a sort of time, Magda suddenly has a sort of breakdown. you knocks on the door, begs breakdown. you knocks on the door, begs to be allowed in, and she's allowed in to be allowed in, and she's allowed in for one final time, and she has a last for one final time, and she has a last go at persuading Hitler to escape. And go at persuading Hitler to escape. And she says, which is probably not true at she says, which is probably not true at all, you know, it would still be all, you know, it would still be possible to get to Ober Saltsburg, to possible to get to Ober Saltsburg, to get to get to your mountain retreat, to get to get to your mountain retreat, to get to safety. And of course, if he does get to safety. And of course, if he does that, then she and the children can do that, then she and the children can do that, too. in her mind. Now, Hitler has that, too. in her mind. Now, Hitler has been very clear with them they should been very clear with them they should go. You know, he instructed Joseph go. You know, he instructed Joseph Gerbles to go. He hasn't asked them to Gerbles to go. He hasn't asked them to stay with him to kill the children, but stay with him to kill the children, but he's very clear what he's doing and he's he's very clear what he's doing and he's not going to be seen to be running away. not going to be seen to be running away. So, Magda Gerbles is is the last person So, Magda Gerbles is is the last person to have a conversation with Hitler. That to have a conversation with Hitler. That door closes. What kind of time? door closes. What kind of time? It's about quart 3 at this moment. Troud It's about quart 3 at this moment. Troud younger who's been so kind of rather younger who's been so kind of rather like Ava has been very very solid, very like Ava has been very very solid, very kind of just doing her job, looking kind of just doing her job, looking after the children, keeping very steady. after the children, keeping very steady. She just has this urge to kind of get She just has this urge to kind of get out of the fur bunker. So she runs up out of the fur bunker. So she runs up the stairs to the upper bunker and there the stairs to the upper bunker and there she finds the Gerbles children and she finds the Gerbles children and nobody has remembered to feed them. So nobody has remembered to feed them. So she gets them food. She we we actually she gets them food. She we we actually know that she gave them bread and butter know that she gave them bread and butter and a jar of preserved cherries and they and a jar of preserved cherries and they sit around a table eating and she talks sit around a table eating and she talks to them about what games they're going to them about what games they're going to play that afternoon and then they to play that afternoon and then they hear a gunshot and Helmet the only boy hear a gunshot and Helmet the only boy of these six children says bullseye but of these six children says bullseye but he has no idea what that gunshot is but he has no idea what that gunshot is but Traler knows what that means. So, it's Traler knows what that means. So, it's 3:30 in the afternoon of the 30th of 3:30 in the afternoon of the 30th of April. A gunshot has been heard. April. A gunshot has been heard. What has happened down below them? What has happened down below them? This is subject to some controversy, but This is subject to some controversy, but what we think has happened is that what we think has happened is that Hitler and Ava, they've gone into the Hitler and Ava, they've gone into the bunker with a cyanide pill each and two bunker with a cyanide pill each and two pistols, a second pistol in case the pistols, a second pistol in case the first one jams. Ava doesn't want to be first one jams. Ava doesn't want to be shot. She wants to be a beautiful shot. She wants to be a beautiful corpse. Hitler wants kind of belt and corpse. Hitler wants kind of belt and braces. What we think happens is they braces. What we think happens is they both take the cyanide. They each take both take the cyanide. They each take the cyanide pill. Hitler was very keen the cyanide pill. Hitler was very keen that they do it simultaneously. that they do it simultaneously. And at the same time, he has shot And at the same time, he has shot himself in the temple. In 2017, French himself in the temple. In 2017, French scientists finally had access to scientists finally had access to Hitler's teeth, which had been held in Hitler's teeth, which had been held in Russia ever since, and they found that Russia ever since, and they found that the teeth had traces of cyanide on them, the teeth had traces of cyanide on them, but no sign of gunshot. What we think but no sign of gunshot. What we think is, yeah, that he shot himself in the is, yeah, that he shot himself in the temple. temple. temple. So, Hitler and his wife are dead. So, Hitler and his wife are dead. Do people give them some time before Do people give them some time before going in or is it sort of instantly when going in or is it sort of instantly when they hear the gunshot? So the valet, he they hear the gunshot? So the valet, he waits a little bit after the gunshot and waits a little bit after the gunshot and then he goes in and they find the two then he goes in and they find the two bodies. Ava Brown has got her her legs bodies. Ava Brown has got her her legs tucked up on the sofa, shoes off. The tucked up on the sofa, shoes off. The little box the cyanide capsule had been little box the cyanide capsule had been in was on the table and he describes her in was on the table and he describes her face as contorted by the poison. He will face as contorted by the poison. He will later say that he couldn't bear to look later say that he couldn't bear to look at Hitler's face. looking forward, he's at Hitler's face. looking forward, he's going to be arrested by the Russians, going to be arrested by the Russians, held there for many years, and tortured, held there for many years, and tortured, endlessly kind of questioned. And the endlessly kind of questioned. And the fact they didn't look at Hitler's face fact they didn't look at Hitler's face is something that bothers them a huge is something that bothers them a huge amount. But and and leads to all this amount. But and and leads to all this kind of speculation about was it really kind of speculation about was it really Hitler who was there because he can't Hitler who was there because he can't confirm that he saw the face. I mean, confirm that he saw the face. I mean, you know, I don't know who else could you know, I don't know who else could have got in there. They wrap the bodies have got in there. They wrap the bodies in blankets. The Russians also got in blankets. The Russians also got obsessed with this and were there two obsessed with this and were there two blankets and at one point you know being blankets and at one point you know being tortured for in loads and loads of tortured for in loads and loads of interrogations. interrogations. interrogations. At one point Linger said there was two At one point Linger said there was two blankets and another point they say blankets and another point they say there was one blanket and that also is there was one blanket and that also is used. It's kind of like but with the used. It's kind of like but with the help of Hitler's chauffeur and some help of Hitler's chauffeur and some officers they carry the bodies up into officers they carry the bodies up into the garden pour on the petrol. actually the garden pour on the petrol. actually Joseph Gerbles lights the match and sets Joseph Gerbles lights the match and sets them on fire.
