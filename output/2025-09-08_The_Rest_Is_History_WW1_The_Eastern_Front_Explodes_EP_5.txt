While the Western front was raging following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, what was unfolding on the Eastern Front? Why was it an even bloodier and more brutal arena than the West? As Austria took on its great antagonist - the spark of the entire war - Serbia, why were its early campaigns constantly blighted by disaster? What terrible mistake did Russia, with its behemoth of an army, make? How would its dramatic war with Germany unfold? And, would this be the beginning of the end of the Habsburg Empire?

This episode is presented by Adobe Express, the quick and easy create anything app. What does that mean? Well, say you need to make a presentation or a video or a social media post or a flyer, maybe even a video. To some, certainly to me, that sounds intimidating. But Tom, with Adobe Express's intuitive features like templates, generative AI, and real time collaboration, it has never been easier. Adobe Express, the quick and easy create anything app. Search Adobe Express in the App Store. Raaruska, a burnedout station building, a sign hanging a skew from the facade. Somber silence. The little town all shot up. A deserted track along the edge of a forest. Sand, sand, feet, and forest. Turkey, oak, and pine. September mists, the dewy chill of daybreak. The area is devoid of life. Even the birds are in hiding. Suddenly, we freeze and stare at each other. Did you hear that? Yes. Artillery. Sounds like we're getting near the thick of it. We weren't the only ones to hear. A silent tremor of anxiety ripples through the crowd. That was how it still was then. Later on, it would become an everyday thing, as much a part of life as a greeting. Then, even more so. Eventually, the greetings were dropped. the guns took their place. This was how the burning of the world announced itself. So that was the burning of the world by the artist Bella Zombie Moldivan who was called up to the Royal Hungarian Hon which is of course in English defenders of the homeland in August 1914. And I say, of course, I don't actually speak Hungarian, but fortunately, we are in the presence of someone who does and speaks all the Balkan languages and knows the Eastern Front, like the back of his hand, and that is, of course, Dominic Sambuk. And he's written one of the most haunting and lyrical of all memoirs, but little known in the English-speaking world because it's about the Eastern Front. And Dominic, I admit I had never heard of it, but presumably, you know, when you're out in the wilds of Muldova or Bellarus or whatever, >> Yeah. >> you talk a little else with the the circles of intellectuals and historians. >> Rugged wy peasants, Tom. Surely. >> Of course, you're out there talking with rugged wy peasants. But you're also in the coffee shops, aren't you? Yeah. >> Discussing the history of middle Europa. Well, this book, The Bony of the World, is actually published by the New York Review of Books, I think it is, in their classics range. So, it's slightly easier to get hold of than you're suggesting. It's a brilliant memoir. Actually, it is a really, really haunting book. So, this guy, he's on the Adriatic Sea. He's on holiday in the summer of 1914. And then the sort of signs literally go up on the by the beach by the hotels saying you're called up. You know, all the men are told to report to their regiments. And off he goes to the Eastern Front and it's far far more hellish than he could possibly have imagined. And the funny thing about it is, of course, loads of people listening to this won't have heard of this, but why would they? Because actually, even though the first shots of the First World War are fired in the east, in Bosnia and in Serbia, these places then completely vanish. >> And Austria basically vanishes from >> Yeah. the knowledge of the First World War. The Archuit gets shot. There's a few generals with big mustaches um in the buildup to the First World War and then it vanishes. The war starts because Austria wants to take revenge on Serbia and the Russians want to stop them. And those three countries just then vanish by and large from our own accounts. It's then all and the SO and Verdun and stuff. But we're going to put that right because we're going to tell the story this week of what happened in the east. And it's a really really remarkable story. So first of all, it is completely different from the story of what's going on in the west. In the west you have the lines of trenches, you have the mud, you have the Tomies, all of that. It's a stationary war, isn't it? Whereas in the east, it's much more like the Great Northern War, or you might say like the Eastern Front in the Second World War. >> Yeah, it is. The front lines kind of ebbing and flowing. These gigantic armies actually without the same technology of the Second World War. So, they don't have very good communications. These vast armies kind of completely lost sometimes in kind of forests and marshlands and whatnot. They're wandering about this colossal landscape. And the other important thing about this is this is a war that is fought on the borderlands of three empires. So, Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Germany. And a lot of the territory that's being fought on is inhabited not by Austrians, Hungarians, Germans, or Russians, but by Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews, which adds its own kind of flavor to the conflict because the borderlands of empires are often bloody. >> Exactly. And actually a lot of historians looking at what happened in the Balkans in East Prussia and in a place called Galacia which is now southeastern Poland and western Ukraine. They see this as a rehearsal for the horrors to come in the 1930s and 1940s. But let's start with the people who fired the very first shots of the war. So the Austrians, the Serbians. So if you remember six years ago when we did our it seems like six years when we did our first series the Archie France Ferdinam was assassinated on the 28th of June 1914 by Gabrielo Princip in Sievo with the collaboration of elements of Serbian military intelligence and then for the next four weeks the Austrians weighed up their options and they decided this was their chance to settle accounts with Serbia forever. And to remind people about the AustraHungarian Empire, it's a dual monarchy under the 170year-old France Joseph. So in other words, what you have is Austrians, Hungarians ruling this huge variety of people. So checks, Poles, Ukrainians, Croats, some Italians, lots of Romanians and so on and so forth. At the time it was seen as a bit of a sick man of Europe. I think the trend among historians now is to say actually the empire is still kind of staggering along. It's not necessarily about to collapse. in the series we did on the assassination of the Archduke and then the road to the First World War. I mean, you very convincingly represented the AustroHungarian Empire as not a basket case, but I have to say in a spoiler alert, >> yeah, >> the record of the AustroHungarian army in the campaigns to come, I mean, they're a shower. >> Yeah, they're an absolute shambles, Tom. I don't think that's going too far. I think if you're looking for an object lesson in utter ineptitude and incompetence, but in a kind and kind of a pleasing way. No, because I mean the thing about the Austrians is you imagine them being slightly inept while eating loads of cake and listening to Mozart and thinking about Freud and Shernburgg and stuff. You'd be disappointed if they then ended up being ruthlessly efficient, wouldn't you? >> Well, I I mean, it was a counterpoint to your your AustroHungarian propaganda in the previous two series. Yeah. I was reading Max Hastings Catastrophe and he said about the AustroHungarian army, its principal strength lay in exotic parade uniforms and splendid bands. And I'm not I'm not taking that as a criticism. >> No, no, no, no. That's we admire that. Surely the big fear for people in the Austrian elite is is nationalism is ethnic nationalism and in particular the South Slav ambitions of the Kingdom of Serbia. And the person who really ends up directing the war effort and the key character in today's story is a man called Baron France Conrad von Hudzenorf. So Conrad von Hudzenorf, he's 61 years old. He's the chief of the general staff. He's got this sort of strange brush of hair and he's got of course a gigantic mustache. >> Is there anyone in this story coming up who doesn't have a gigantic mustache and they just get bigger. >> Yeah. >> I was having to get out the thesaurus running out of superlatives. >> Massive, gigantic, colossal, stupendous, stupifying. >> Each time you think you've seen the biggest mustache, you're wrong cuz there's another one to come. >> Yeah. >> Uh the basically the further east you go in the story, I think the mustaches get bigger. >> And this guy Conrad Yeah. The salient thing about him is he's in love with a much younger woman and he wants to impress her by basically starting a world war. >> Correct. >> That's my vague memory of him. >> Yeah. So, we talked about this a tiny bit in the France Ferdinand series. Conrad, he's a very dapper man and he's sort of like all these people, he's kind of melancholic, but he's got a romantic side. So, when his first wife died, I think about 1907, he met this woman at a dinner party. She was called Gina von Reininghouse. She was 27 and she was the wife of an Austrian businessman. And Conrad immediately said to himself, "Well, this this is the lady for me." And he then wrote her 3,000 letters >> when he could have been looking at railway timets, >> right? >> Oh, I'll write another letter instead. >> He wrote her 3,000 letters begging her, so you know, I enjoyed meeting at the dinner party. Would you consider leaving your husband and marrying me? And amazingly she she ends up having an affair with him. But to get a divorce and then to remarry they will need effectively the permission of the emperor and the approval of vianese high society. And comrade knows the only way to get that is by starting and winning a world war. >> And so that's what he does. >> Well, although to be fair to him, he has always been deadly serious about the threat of Serbia. He really does see Serbia as a lethal menace to the empire's survival. >> So he's the kind of hawk, isn't he, to France Ferdinand's dove? >> Completely he is. So in 1913 he had asked 25 times if he could start a war with Serbia and basically France Ferdinand had blocked him at every opportunity but within hours of France Ferdinand's death he says brilliant this is the opportunity what an irony the one guy who was stopping me I can use his death as the pretext and he said to the foreign minister of Austria count burtold you know we have a poisonous adder at our heel and we need to stamp on its head and burkold I think we quoted this in the France Ferdinand series later wrote with a faraway look of melancholy on his fine featured face. He concluded emphatically with three words. War. War. War. >> So there's never been any conspiracy theory that he was behind the murder of France Ferdin. >> Gosh, that's a good idea. >> It's a good one, isn't it? >> Well, maybe that could be the conspiracy that our team of crack detectives who will be introducing in the second half of the show, they can investigate that. >> That's the season finale. Sure. >> Yeah, that is exciting news for listeners. what's coming in the second half. >> You'll be surprised. Well, you won't if you've heard the previous episode, but newcomers will be surprised. Right. So, the Austrians send their ultimatum on 23rd of July. The Serbs reject the key demands, and on the 28th of July, France Joseph signs the declaration of war. Now, the mad thing about the Austrians is they are conscious that the Serbs have this gigantic patron and protector in Russia, but they really give Russia no thought at all. They don't send any troops to their eastern border. Conrad's hope is that basically the Germans will either deter the Russians or in the worst case scenario, if the Russians join the war, the Germans will deal with them. All he's thinking about is this spectacular victory that he's going to win over Serbia. The question though, of course, is is Austria going to get a win? I mean, this is the way weird thing. The Austrians haven't really given any thought to whether they actually win such a war. So, they have 40 infantry divisions, the Austrians. The Serbs have 11. The Serbs population is much smaller. Oddly, relative to population, the Serbs have more troops, but the Austrians had more in absolute numbers. The Austrians have quite good weapons, but not enough of them. And the reason they don't have enough of them is because before the war, there'd have been this endless endless budget squabbbling with the Hungarian Parliament. And that, I think, tells its own story about AustriaHungary's greatest military problem, which is basically diversity is not its strength. So most of the men don't even speak the same language. Most of the officers speak German and there's actually been huge arguments about whether that should continue or not. You know, is it right that all officers have to speak German? But out of every hundred soldiers in the AustraHungarian army, 26 speak German, 23 Hungarian, 13 Czech, nine Serbian and orats, eight speak Polish, eight are Ukrainian, seven are Romanians, four are Slovaks, and two are Slovenians. And I'm sure there's also a category other >> Roma. Exactly. Or Jews who speak Yiddish or something. >> Yeah. So in other words, you know, this is a sort of a real rag kind of it's a tower of Babel, Tom. It's a traveling tower of Babel. Conrad thinks, well, that's not a problem. We can overcome this. He had written many times before the war in 1890, for example, he had written that leadership is all about swift decision-m and strength of will. All you need is strength of will. I mean, actually, the Austrians don't really have either of those things. They're incredibly slow decision makers. And as I remember that, don't they also have a massively complicated railway system that prevents them from moving troops rapidly across their territories? >> Yes, exactly. >> Which is what Conrad should have been studying rather than writing letters to Gina, one might argue. >> Well, every way in which they organized this war is laughable. Here's a perfect example. Right. The morning after the declaration war, the early hours of the 29th of July, they say, "Well, we're going to kick off the campaign." And they have this river warship called the Bodrog. >> Great name. >> Which begins firing shells across the Danube into the central Belgrade. So you think, okay, well, it's all going to kick off. But then the Austrians do absolutely nothing. So they then do nothing for 2 weeks. And the reason for that is that Conrad to please the kind of farming lobby in the empire had introduced harvest leave for the army. So all his men are away like literally working like in the sort of Thomas Hardy. >> Yeah. With their sides. >> Yeah. like Thomas Hardy novel, they're kind of sthing corn or wheat or whatever they're doing and um the troops from places like Zagreb and Budapest won't get back until the end of July. So basically the Serbs have all this time to get organized. They got two weeks to get organized. And here is the maddest part of this story. The man that the Serbs want to lead their armies, lead the resistance, it's a man called Radimir Putnik. and he had led their armies in the Bulan wars. So the wars they'd fought against the Ottoman Empire and then Bulgaria just before the first world war. And Radir Putnik, everybody loves Radimir Putnik in Serbia. He's in his late 60s. He's got a huge white beard >> of course >> and he's got chronic emphyma >> of course. So he's basically he's a peak first world war general. >> He is. Well, also he's been smoking those kind of really ac cigarettes. the kind you love when you're hanging out in the cafes of >> correct Bucharest. >> Now, here's the thing, right? Where has he been? Of course, he's been taking the waters at a spa while this has been going on and in all places in the Austrohungarian Empire. So, this bloke Putnick has been at a spa called Bad Glyenburgg, which is in Bohemia. He finds out there's going to be a war. He says, "Oh, I better get home." He gets on the train and he's literally changing trains in Budapest when he's arrested by the Austrohungarians. And this, I think, is the ultimate sign of the AustroHungarian lack of seriousness. They've arrested this guy who's going to lead Serbia's armies against them. And when France Joseph hears about this, he says, "Oh, this is very poor poor form. It's you can't arrest this guy. Let him go home. It's shiverous." >> Yeah. >> So, do you know what they do? They they literally put him on a train to go home. Now, it takes him an eternity to actually get home. >> I mean, on one level, it reflects tremendously well on the AustroHungarian Empire. >> Yeah. >> On another level, >> what were they thinking? >> I don't think the British would have done that with Napoleon. Do you? >> Well, would they have done that with Michael Collins? >> No, I don't think they would. Although they did No, cuz they did arrest Aean Dealer and then let him go. >> They locked him up in Lincoln jail. >> Yeah, but later on they arrested him by accident and let him go when the truth was going on. All the truth negotiations. >> Oh, well that's fair enough if it's the truth. Yet another opportunity to praise our beloved country. Wonderful. Well done. You handled that beautifully. Um anyway, Putnick takes him ages to get home. The other Serbian officers basically have to blow open his safe to find out what his plans are. They read his plans. His plans are we won't engage the Austrians on the border. We'll actually withdraw from Belgrade and we'll wait for the Austrians to move before reacting. So the Serbs are on paper massive underdogs in this war. I mean, this is the war the First World War is all about, and nobody really knows anything about it. The Serbs have about 200,000 men, but they've just fought in the Bulan Wars. Very vicious wars, actually, in which they didn't necessarily cover themselves with certainly not moral glory. They haven't really got any uniforms left. Everyone says they look like tramps and scarecrows. They're sort of very battered looking, but they're famously stoical, the Serbian soldiers, and they can melt into the mountains, can't they? >> They can melt into the mountains. The historian Nick Lloyd, who's just written a brilliant book on the Eastern Front, he quotes one guy who said, "If you give a Serbian soldier bread and an onion, he's satisfied." >> And is that your experience? Would you concur with that? >> Yeah, I think so. I think that's absolutely right. Yeah. I mean, in my experience, like they're always eating onions and stuff. They love it. They're also They're very fierce. I mean, this is a terrible This is now degenerating into absolute sort of bulkan stereotype 101, but >> yeah, >> the Michael Palin of >> Yeah, exactly. The Serbs are a proud rugged people. Basically, you're fighting the Serbs. They're complete bastards. They see fighting as a great adventure. They're led into battle by these musicians playing on bag pipes and playing like folk songs on fiddles. And actually, this is a continuity in Serbian history because in the 1990s when they were fighting in the sort of post Yugoslav wars, music was a huge part of Serbian nationalism. Something called turbo folk pounding music. >> It's brilliant that you're here to do this. >> Oh, that's great. Well, >> bring all your local knowledge. >> Okay. Well, yeah, I read that in the newspaper. Um, anyway, back to uh the Austrians. The Austrians are expecting a complete walkover. And basically, Conrad wants a really quick victory because if he wins a quick victory over Serbia, he thinks Romania and Bulgaria will pile in on the side of the central powers. However, at this point, Conrad accepts that actually he will have to go and lead the army against the Russians. He can't pretend the Russians don't exist any longer. So he casts round for the ideal man to fight the Serbs. And a man pops into his head who's had a perhaps unfortunate beginning to the summer because this is the governor of Bosnia. He's called General Oscar Piorek. He is the man who had invited France Ferdinand to Sievo, been responsible for his security, had told him nothing could possibly go wrong, and if you remember, had even told his army not to enter Sievo under any circumstances because he wanted to show the world how safe it was for France Ferdinand. >> But aside from the assassination, I mean, it had gone well. >> It actually been a brilliant trip otherwise. It's gone really well. Now, Pioric has a point to prove, and he wrote to Vienna. said, "I intend to be absolutely offensive." Which is the mantra that we adopt on this show, isn't it, Tom? >> Yes, it is. >> However, you mentioned Max Hastings's book, Catastrophe. Pooric has never actually fought in a battle, and Max Hastings describes him as, and I quote, a bachelor who had devoted his life monastically to his profession while remaining ignorant of every aspect of it that was either modern or important. So maybe not very promising. On the 12th of August, so two weeks after the Austrians had declared war, which is mad, Pooric finally says, "Right, we're ready." And he orders the fifth army to advance across the river Dina from eastern Bosnia into central Serbia, which is mountainous and very, very densely forested. So, excellent for military maneuvering. It's a total shambles. So, on the first day, the bridging equipment doesn't turn up. So, basically, they have to send their engineers to paddle across and build these pontoon bridges. They all get across. It's the Balkans in August. It's incredibly hot. It's incredibly dusty. They're carrying these huge packs and they're dripping with sweat. Max Hastings quotes a soldier called Matty Malaysich. He said, "Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. A kit as heavy as lead, unbearable heat. And yet we must keep going. Keep going. It's so hard that a man instinctively asks himself why he was brought into this world. Was it just to suffer?" >> So morale is good. >> Morale is tiptop. They march in suffocating heat and like dust through all these Serbian villages, but they're slightly perturbed to see the place is almost empty. So, it's silent. Too silent. >> Very good, Tom. Very good. There are just old crrons and small children cackling, but they have white eyeballs undoubtedly. But there's no men. Where are the men? We talked in the episode about Belgium about the Germans fear of funer of sort of partisans but this is on a different level because the Serbs they love I mean the Serbs love a partisan and so from the very beginning they wage this partisan campaign and it's exacerbated in the minds of the Austrians by the fact that the Serbs even their regular troops because they don't have any uniforms left they look like bandits they've kind of got their you know sort of bandeliers of ammunition >> I mean basically they are bandits >> they are yeah pretty much so what they will do is the Austrians will march through a village And then they'll go through and they'll go off into the woods. And at this point, the Serbs will strike. They'll shoot them all from behind and they'll melt away into the Bulan landscape. Now, the Austrians do not take this lying down. And now we come to a massive feature of the Eastern Front, no matter where it happens, actually. And this is the killing of civilians. The Austrians make the Germans in Belgium look like, you know, social workers or something, right? So, their field commander is a guy called General Lorius Ritter vonFrank. >> Of course, he and he said, "Listen, the Serbs are terrible people anyway. Since we're under attack from civilians, like the gloves are off. Forget about international law. It doesn't really apply. Um, let's just, you know, go for it." So, straight away, they start looting and burning these villages. They shoot anybody that they think even remotely is connected with partisan activity. Now, I have to say, before anyone starts sort of weeping for the Serbs, the Serbs 3 years earlier had really disgraced themselves in the Bulan wars. I mean they had behaved really atrociously in Kosovo and Macedonia and so on. What they've sewed they are now reaping to some extent. >> Can I just ask in um Belgium when the Germans commit atrocities against civilians? This is obviously bad news for Germany's reputation and therefore in the long run for their ability to prosecute the war. But is anyone paying attention to what's going on in the Balkans? And isn't there a kind of a slight attitude in the gentleman's clubs of London that this is just the kind of thing that people do in the Balkans? >> Yeah, totally right. Double standard. The same double standard applies when we're talking about the Russian atrocities in Poland and Ukraine, for example. I mean, exactly that that basically nobody cares in the West. And in so far as they do care, whenever it comes up, they say, "Well, I mean, this kind of thing happens there all the time." Ancient hatreds. >> Ancient hatreds. Exactly. That's exactly what happens. And having said, "Oh, this what the Serbs swed they're now reaping." Even so, there are some really, really grim stories. So, here's a good example. These are told by the Austrians themselves. So, this is from a young Hungarian officer called Alexander Palvacini. So, his column of troops was fired on from a cornfield on the 17th of August. And they sent out patrols. And these patrols came back with 63 people. They said they'd found hanging around the field. Some of these Palac claimed were women and children caught with rifles. One of them was an Orthodox priest caught with grenades. and he wrote, "An hour later, only a mass grave was visible. In order not to upset our soldiers by the sound of shooting, these people were bayonetted to death. The priest's beard had supposedly been ripped off. Our men were that angry after the atrocities committed against them." He describes this very starkly, and then he has no regrets or guilt. He says, "The hatred for us is boundless, and everyone is our enemy. We're not fighting against an army of 300,000, but against a whole nation." And Dominic, presumably the evidence for the priest having the grenades and the women and children having guns comes exclusively from the people who've shot them. >> Of course. Yes. Who's to say how true this is? And the Austrians do not try to cover this up at all. They actually want it to be public. So Conrad says, you know, make this very overt because we want to terrify people into collaborating with us. There's an a terrible story told by another Austrahungarian officer a week later, the 24th of August. He says, "I met a column of 30 people assembled for execution." He says they were being kind of kicked and whipped and whatnot while they were standing there. He and a couple of others tried to restrain the people doing it, but it was impossible. And he goes on to say, "There was an execution place at the edge of the woods behind the monastery. The Serbs had to dig their own graves. Then they were sat down in front of the pit and bayoneted five at a time. Three infantrymen stabbed each. A gruesome spectacle. It was terrible to see earth being heaped on the victims while some still lived and indeed tried to climb out of the grave and to see some of those rising from the grave. Our men behaved like savages. I couldn't stand the sight and I left them to it. So, you know, Austrohungarian officers themselves are troubled by this. They probably executed about 3,000 people in two weeks. >> Oh dear. Yeah. >> For all the stuff about the military bands and the cake, there is a kind of dark side to the Austrian army. So the id the id as well as the ego is in play. >> Yeah. Sigman Freud would have a field day. Now meanwhile the Austrians have been marching into Serbia. They have a particular objective in mind which is this railway junction at place called Valvo. And in the way there is this kind of heavily forested ridge called Mount Su. And they reach the top on the late afternoon of the 15th of August. They're knackered. They're very thirsty. They're very hungry. There's a massive thunderstorm that night. And in the middle of the thunderstorm, that's the point that the Serbs choose to strike back. And the result is total chaos. The Austrians are inexperienced. They panic. They start running away. They're kind of a huge mob of Austrians running away down this mountain. Unbelievably, they just keep running and within 4 days they've crossed the river again and they've gone back to Bosnia. So, their first attempt to invade Serbia has been a ludicrous failure and a very bloody failure. The Serves have lost 16,000 men. The Austrians have lost 30,000, including loads and loads of their officers. And in the eyes of the world, this is a terrible humiliation for them. General Poyor has spent the whole time in Sievo. >> Right. >> Ironically, he says, "Oh, well, this wasn't my fault at all." I think it was the fault of our Czech troops. Actually, they're very disloyal. They're poorly behaved checks. By blaming the checks, he's able to cling on to his job. And straight away he starts writing to Conrad and he says, "I'd love to have another crack at the Serbs. Would you send me some more men and some more guns and whatnot?" Conrad says, "No, I don't think so. You've had your chance." But Pyoric is well connected at court. He gets his friends to lobby the Emperor France Joseph. And eventually he's given permission to have another crack at the Serbs. So at dawn on the 14th of September, he has a second go. Once again, they cross the rivers into Serbia from Bosnia. This time the Serbs have dug um trenches and it degenerates quite quickly into kind of bloody hand-to-hand trench warfare. The Austrians are thrown back. Oh no, it not quite as chaotically as before. They say, "Well, we'll have another go." So in November, they have attempt number three. Now, at this point, the Serbs are absolutely exhausted themselves, and they're running out of shells. They haven't got any artillery. They can't really rest their troops because they're running out of men. So slowly, painfully, the Austrians are able to inch their way forward and the Serbs have to abandon Belgrade and they take up a new defensive line on a river called the Colibara which is deep inside central Serbia. So at this point the Austrians foolishly I think Tom decide to celebrate victory. They have premature victory celebrations. The emperor sends Pyior a message of congratulations. Lots of towns name him an honorary citizen. A street in Sievo is renamed in his honor. >> Wow, that's punchy. >> That is Yeah. And the man is basically his foolishness has caused the whole thing. It's caused the First World War. Yeah. However, it will surprise you to know that the Austrians are perhaps being a little bit premature cuz that guy who they'd released the bloke with the beard and emphyma, Vladimir Putnik, his emphyma's got far worse under the pressure war. So, he can't breathe. We will not surrender. >> Exactly. But even though he can't breathe, he's still a much better commander than any of the Austrians. So he knows that the Austrians have now they've they've gone on the attack. They've sustained massive casualties, more than 130,000 casualties. They haven't got any food. They're ravaged by lice. They're miles ahead of their supply lines. They've got no shoes. Their fancy uniforms are in rags. They're very miserable. And actually, the weather has now changed. They haven't been very This is the thing about the Eastern Front. There's only two weather settings. It's either unbelievably suffocatingly hot or you're dying of, you know, frostbite. >> Frostbite. Exactly. So now it's snowing. And meanwhile, Putnik has done something amazing. He's arranged with the French to have 11,000 shells imported via Salonica Thessaloniki. They're the wrong size for the Serbian guns. So, every single shell has been taken apart and reassembled and transported to the front. So, late November, Putnik rallies his forces. He's basically got all the Serbian men. That's 200,000 of them. He's got 400 guns. And he has a secret weapon. What's that, Dominic? The secret weapon is a man. It's Peta Karajorovich, the king of Serbia. >> The king of Serbia. And Dominic, just a wild guess here. >> Yeah. >> From what I've previously learned about significant players in the early months of the First World War. I'm guessing he's very elderly. >> Yeah. >> I'm guessing he's very melancholy. >> Yeah. >> And I'm guessing that he has some terrible ailment. Would I be correct? >> He's got rheumatism, but if you Google him, he really does have a superb mustache. >> And he's elderly. >> Yeah. He's 70, >> of course. Anyway, he toss the trenches, King Petar, and he says, "My children, I have learned that some among your number tire of fighting, but I I shall stay to the end." And a French reporter who was there said of the Serbs, "I'm sure this is true." Each of them felt his soul gripped with a furious desire to seize victory or to die for their old uncle who had stayed there among his children in spite of his failing health, even as the cannons roared and their bullets whistled. I mean, it's interesting, isn't it, how it mirrors the pattern of what's happened on the Western Front that the Germans overextend their supply lines. There's an elderly man who says, "We're going to fight. Counterattack is launched." And I I mean, we're being harsh on the Austrians, but I wonder whether it doesn't reflect a basic fact that all the kind of armies are struggling to cope with that the capacity for defense is vastly greater than the ability of attacking forces to break through those defenses. Do you think? >> I think that's absolutely true. Once you got modern artillery and machine guns and things, >> trenches and things. >> Completely true. However, I think anybody who's written about the Austrian performance in the war, so Nick Lloyd or Alexander Watson or whoever in their books, they unanimously agree that the Austrian performance is absolutely reasonable. >> Anyway, the Serbs launch their counterattack on the morning of the 3rd of December 1914. It's a foggy, snowy morning. They start with the shells that the Austrians weren't expecting. Then they charge. There's a brilliant description actually in Nick Lloyd's Eastern Front book. The battle goes on into the night. There's kind of hang grenades exploding. There's troops charging. There's machine gun fire. The Austrians are losing more and more men. Basically, they start going backwards. And day after day, they go backwards. By the 9th of December, they're falling back into Belgrade. And then 5 days later, just say, "Okay, the game is up again." And they withdraw across the river Sava, across the Danube, back into imperial territory. Unbelievably, even as Serbian troops are marching through the center of Belgrade, being cheered as liberators, Pioric is writing to Vienna saying, "I I'd love I'd love to have another go." >> Oh, no. A fourth go. >> Yeah. >> You got to admire his self-confidence, I suppose. >> Exactly. Even the emperor says, "No, no, no. Enough is enough." And actually, just before Christmas, he's sacked. And I think it's fair to say he's had a very disappointing uh 6 months. >> Yeah, that CV is going to take quite a lot of work. >> Exactly. Actually, I didn't quote this actually, but in uh I think it's maybe Max Hastings's book, there's a line from him where he says he's so disappointed to have been sacked. He says, "I'm very disappointed because I I now won't have the opportunity to clear my name of the very cruel and foolish things that people are saying about me." Well, for Austria, this could not have been a more terrible fiasco. It sent 462,000 men to fight in the Balkans, of whom 273,000 have become casualties. Wow. Oh my god. So over half. >> Yeah. Now that includes tens of thousands killed, a far greater number who are missing, and tens and tens of thousands who are dead of disease of one kind or another. And the real nightmare for the Austrians is that now that their weakness has been exposed for everybody to see, the vultures are circling. And one vulture above all, and that is their supposed ally, Italy. However, there is one bit of good news for the central powers in the east. Cuz although the Austrians have let themselves down, elsewhere, our old friends, the Germans, have found two very impressively efficient and ruthless commanders to lead them against the Russians and mustachioed commanders. Right. So yet more yeah massive Tutonic mustache action to come and we will find out who they are and uh what impact they have on the Eastern Front after the break.

Now, Thomas, you know, in the Middle Ages, it could take you years if you were a monk to create a manuscript. You'd have to copy it out word by word, and then after all that, the margins would be ready, and you'd put all kind of decorative elements and all kinds of guilt and stuff in the margins, and it would look fantastic. So, it might take often years to finish, but the finished product would then last for centuries. And that is pretty much what the Folio Society does today, only, of course, with slightly less parchment. and uh fewer quills. >> Yes, the Folio Society takes some of the greatest works ever written, things like George Orwell's 1984 or the the quests in JR Tolken or Frank Herbert's Dune and their team of editors and designers and artisans.

Um, we've been looking at Austria messing things up. Time now to look at another power messing things up. And Dominic, this power is Russia. And we haven't really mentioned Russia at all, have we? Which is odd because in some ways perhaps the Russians more than any other power have responsibility for turning a Bulan crisis into a world war. Yeah, I think that's a fair case, Tom. Some listeners may disagree, but the Russians didn't have to treat Austria's attack on Serbia as the trigger for an all-out conflict. They did. They felt they couldn't give ground. And so, they've got involved in the war, a war which will of course in the long run destroy the Tsarist regime and kill Nicholas II. So, Russia is the world's largest country, 164 million people. It's the world's fourth biggest economy. >> So, what are the top three? Britain, Germany, America. >> Yes, Britain, Germany, the United States. Um, but not in that order. I think I think the United States at this point is number one. And the Russians have the world's largest army. So they've got one and a half million people with another three million in reserve. This is what had always terrified the Germans and the Austrians. There are just so many Russians. So the supreme commander of the Russian army at this point is not thesar. Thesar does become the supreme commander later. But at first he appoints his uncle, Grand Juke Nikolai, who is an enormous man. He's 6'6. So Peter the Great style. >> Peter the Great Style. Like Pete the Great, he is a terrifying man. He's got a famously savage temper. And it gives you some sense of his character when I tell you that his great specialism and hobby was in breeding especially aggressive boroy hounds. What's a boroy hound? >> That's his kind of hound. Very aggressive. >> Okay, >> that's cleared it up, hasn't it? >> Good. >> So he would take these bour hounds hunting and he has supposedly personally cut the throats of thousands of wolves. >> Wow. But no bellow action. >> No bellow action. And yet there is a softer side to him because when Nicholas II says to his uncle says uncle Nikolai, you know, I'd like you to be supreme commander, he's never commanded troops in battle either. And he's very uncertain. He sort of says to everybody, God, I I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm completely out of my depth. And actually, he started crying because he was so anxious. It's quite a feature again, isn't it? Unexpected feature that that generals are always crying. >> Yeah. So, their initial thought is that they will send 2/3 of their huge army south into Galysia, Poland, and Ukraine. >> So, they're dividing their forces up, which always works out well in war, doesn't it? >> It's always a brilliant idea. They'll send them south against the Austrians, and we'll find out in the final episode of this series how they got on, but they send the other third into the German province of East Prussia. So this is the sort of very heavily forested watery landscape of the Tutonic Knights and the Baltic Crusades. It kind of got an odd kind of a sort of dreary romance to it I think. >> So the the Tutonic Knights who had been defeated uh in this landscape at a place called Tannenburg. >> They had indeed and we will be talking about that. You might say this is very foolish. The Germans have the world's best army. Why would you take them on with only a third of your own? And the reason, as so often, the French are the real villains in all this. The French have basically made the Russians promise to force the Germans to fight on two fronts. So the Russians are doing this to please the French. Basically, because there's a load of lakes in the middle of East Prussia called the Missurian Lakes, this kind of chain of little lakes, and they're going to send one army around the north and one army around the south. So the one that will go north is the first army and this is commanded confusingly by a general called Paul von Renamp. >> He's the Russian commander just to be clear. >> Yes, he's the Russian commander. >> He obviously has a German name because again this is a feature of the events of 1914. >> He is a Baltic German baron and he has I think the outstanding mustache in history. I think he's the winner if people Google him. Let me look it up. Wow, that is impressive. That's enormous. >> Yeah, there you go. It's like a muskrat. >> He's he's great. I think he's great. He's not a very good general, but he's he's got a great mustache >> on the mustache front cuz, you know, and the competition is very heavy at this time. >> It's very fierce, but not from his uh colleague. So, the second army, which will go south around the lakes, is commanded by a guy called Alexander Samson. So, he's from Kerson in in Ukraine. He has a beard unusually and he looks very like I think Nick Timothy the conservative MP and former guru of Theresa May >> which is to say he looks a little bit like Nicholas II. >> Yeah, a little bit actually. Yeah. So now he there's always a little a little nice detail with these guys. Samson has horrendous amma. He has really really bad asthma. >> What is it with generals and terrible breathing? >> So he can't really breathe either anyway. I shouldn't laugh. On the 17th of August, the Russians set off. Renan Camp goes first and Samson will follow further south from War. They're a colorful host because most of them are peasants, peasant infantry, but they have kind of Turkmen and Calmic cavalry with yellow robes and sheepkin hats. There's cosacs with calf tans and kind of there's boots that go up at the end. >> So for fans of exotic orientalism, Exactly. It's a tremendous show. Well, it's amusing for us, but for the people of East Prussia, it's awful. Alexander Watson, who's written a couple of brilliant books about the Eastern Front, he says, "This event, which is barely known in the West, is a defining experience for a generation of Germans." So we don't often think of Germany being invaded in the First World War, but when the Russians cross the border into East Prussia, this is unbelievably traumatic for the people of Germany because the Russians advanced with unbridled ferocity. 3-fifths of the small towns in East Prussia were looted and burned. More than a quarter of the farms were burned to the ground. Again, as so often, the obsession with partisans. Grand Juke Nikolai said, "Any village where our troops are attacked in any way must be completely destroyed." They shoot about 1,500 people. And I think the reason there's not more is cuz East is not very densely populated. They would have shot more if there were more people. These are the bloodlands then of Timothy Snider's book. >> Yeah. Probably the worst place to be born in the 20th century. >> Do you know it's also the worst place to be an enthusiastic cyclist like your great uncle? Is it? >> Yeah. Why? Because to have a bicycle in the Russian Empire, bicycles were a luxury and they were very unusual. Russian soldiers when they saw people on bicycles assumed that they were military machines and shot their riders cuz they said, "Oh, these are these people are clearly partisans." One in 20 of the people killed by the Russians was riding a bike. >> Very glad that great uncle Charlie was on the Eastern Front. >> Yeah. >> You wouldn't have fared well. >> It's rare that you hear people say they wish that their ancestors had on the Eastern Front. True. In either World War. Anyway, at first the Russians advance and they think, "Oh, this is going brilliantly." East Prussia has this army guarding it called the eighth army German. They're hugely outnumbered. They have an elderly commander called General Von Pritvitz. >> Does he have breathing problems and a large mustache? >> I think he has commanding problems actually rather than breathing problems. >> Because when his men first meet the Russians at a place called Gmbinon, a village, the Germans end up retreating in confusion and Pritvitz says, "Oh, we're doomed. We're never going to beat the Russians." The Russians, meanwhile, are cocka hoop. So Renampamp's men, they've never seen such wealth as they're seeing on these German farms. So they're absolutely all these stories about them stuffing themselves with ham and goose. They find a cheese factory. Oh yeah, this is a great story. And they loot this cheese factory. So all the Russians, all the cavalry are riding with with an entire cheese dangling from their saddles. And one of them said later, "A cavalry man is used to many odor, but never did we smell as we did then. It's a stink of cheese." Now, at this point, the Russians make some terrible mistakes. First of all, Renan camp, he's the guy who's gone north with the first army. He says, "Well, we're we're doing splendidly. Let's um have a little rest now and gather some supplies. Now, Samson is going around the lakes to the south." He has a very tense relationship with Renf and he wants in on this cheese action and on the spoils and stuff. And he says to his men, "Come on, keep going south around the lakes." Now, both of them assume that the Germans have finished. And indeed the German commander Pritvitz, >> he thinks that. >> He thinks that he rang Malta and on the 21st of August, he said, "My men are as good as done." >> But it's interesting, isn't it? This is exactly the same time as the Germans are making an identical mistake about the French and the British on the Western Front. >> Yeah. Goes back to the point you made in the first half of this episode, Tom. If you're attacking in the First World War, you're generally in trouble. >> Yeah. You're losing. Anyway, Pritvitz said, "Ah, you know, we're doomed. Let's all withdraw. This is a terrible disaster." The very next afternoon, Vonmulka sent a message to Prit Vitz's headquarters which pleasingly was at Marianborg beside the vast fortress of the Tutonic Knights. So today that's Malborg in Poland. I've been to this castle. It's one of my favorite castles. Huge brick castle. Brilliant. Yeah. It's the one built out of brick, isn't it? >> Yeah, exactly. Priv kind of opens the message and the message basically says, "You're fired." Because in his place, Mulker is going to appoint somebody who he thinks can win the war against the Russians. And he's got another elderly general in mind. And this is the top chutonic walrus, hune from the oak of Prussia, Paul von Hindenborg, >> right? Yes. Who will play a key role in the story of the the Nazis. >> So Hindenburg is of classic Junka stock. That means he's part of the kind of Prussian landowning classes. He fought in the FrancoRussian War. He then taught at the war academy and he'd retired in 1911. So since then he's been sitting at home in Hanover basically smoking his pipe and reading the paper. And when war broke out he waited for the call and it never came and he was gutted and he complained. He said I sit like an old woman in front of the stove. I've got nothing to do. And Mula sends him this telegram. It reached Hannover in the afternoon of the 22nd of August. I want you to go and command the army in East Prussia. Hindenburg sent a brilliant tur two-word reply. I'm ready. And then at 4:00 in the morning, he went down to Hannover station. There was a special train waiting for him on a darkened platform. And he gets on this train and on the train is his new chief of staff. And then they head off east. Everybody said of Hindenburg. The thing about Hindenburg that's great is he's he's very meticulous. He takes his work seriously, but he's bit like General in France. He's completely unflapable. He will never panic. He's very good humored. His men like him and he will never never collapse in a kind of hissy fit. But actually, Mula only wants Hindenburg as a figurehead. There's a claim that actually Hindenburg only got the job because his house was on the same train line that the chief of staff would be taking. Because it's the chief of staff that Mula really wants. And this is a younger man, Eric Ludenorf, 49 years old, also a key figure conquering Leesge, who we met earlier, didn't we, in the series. >> Yes, exactly. He is not a junker. He's not from the landowning classes. He was from a merchant family in what's now Poland. And he'd become this brilliant military prodigy. The reason that he's not appointed is because he's not of the right class. And the Kaiser doesn't like him, does he? Because he sees him as a paranu. >> The irony of course the Kaiser thinks that he's the kind of man who would wear the wrong shoes. And he probably does, but it doesn't matter because he's a very good general. >> Everybody has always said of Ludenorf, he's the great star of the German army. He's the rising star. He's the sort of future England captain. Isn't that what people say about cricketers? Yes. >> Yeah. They'd also said, however, that he's an incredibly glacial and ruthless person. >> Well, the two aren't contradictory, surely. >> No, no, no. Of course not. He's I mean, he is a serious person. His wife said of him she'd never known him to laugh or make a joke of any kind. She also always called him Ludenorf by his surname. I like that. Um, but that said, actually, we can overdo this cuz his men were very loyal to him and they adored him. A general can be glacial and never laugh and have his wife call him by his surname. >> Yeah. >> But if these are qualities that make it likelier that you as a private soldier are going to survive a battle, of course you're going to love him. >> Yeah. Of course. As you said, Ludenorf has been the big star of the war's first weeks. Captured Lege. The Kaiser just before he got on the train actually gave him the highest award for gallantry. Polo Marit the Blue Max as it's called. And Mula said to Ludenorf, "You are the only man who can save East Prussia. You're the only man I trust. go and do it. So he and Hindenburg get on the train. They go off to East Russia. Now meanwhile, Samson is still coming with 180,000 men south around the lakes. It will amaze people to hear there's an atmosphere of general chaos in the Russian advance. They don't have enough trucks. Half the men have barely trained. They've got terrible intelligence. So they've got no idea where the Germans are or basically where they are, where they're going, any of this. I don't want to engage in um in national stereotyping. >> No, never on this show. But I'm going to Yeah. >> Would it be fair to say that it is a clash between Prussian efficiency and Russian chaos? >> Yes. Basically, it would be completely fair. So, actually, Hindenburg and Ludenorf have come up with a plan on the train. They'll basically send some cavalry north. So, Renan Camp thinks they're coming north and that he won't keep coming. Meanwhile, they'll use the trains to move all of the rest of their men against Samson in the south because the Germans are doing everything that the Austrians don't. The German high command have removed an incompetent commander, replaced with an efficient commander. They're using their trains to their best ability. >> Exactly. >> They have good intelligence. Yeah. >> So, it's looking good for them >> completely. So, on the 23rd of August, they get to um the Marenberg, the the castle of the Tutonic Knights. Hindenburg goes for a walk around the castle and actually if you again if you Google it you can see some of the propaganda postcards that were produced of Hindenburg kind of outside this castle thinking about the Tutonic Knights. Whether he did this or not I don't know. Anyway, the next day they tore the um the front Hindenburg and Ludenorf. There's a proper war zone. There's refugees everywhere. There's columns of black smoke rising over villages in the distance. All of this they go past this village called Tannenburgg. And both generals know their history because it was here in 1410 that the Tutonic Knights had lost a titanic battle with the Poles and the Lithuanians. And as they're driving back from Tannenburg, they get brilliant news. The Germans have intercepted two Russian radio messages. Russian communications are terrible. They're not properly disguising their messages. Renamp and Samson are now so far apart that they cannot support each other. And Hindenburg says, "Well, this is our chance. We'll go for Samson. We won't just beat him. We'll annihilate him." And when he gets back home, Hindenburg is very Generalike. Says to his officers, "Gentlemen, our preparations are so well in hand that we can all sleep soundly tonight." And he likes a good night's sleep, doesn't he, Hindenburg? >> He loves a good night's sleep, as we will discover. So on the 25th of August, it begins. Samson is pushing these Russians deeper and deeper into the kind of lakelands, into the forests, but he has no idea what's out there. When he hears the first reports of German attacks on the flanks, he doesn't realize that this is a trap. He keep says go deeper go deeper keep going. Now back at Marenberg Ludenorf as always despite this glacial reputation he's a nervous wreck. So he's beside himself with nerves and actually at one point Hindenburg has to take him out of a meeting take him for a walk to calm him down. >> Yeah cuz Hindenburg just puffing on his pipe. Yeah mustache is drooping. He's he's mellow. >> Exactly. Ludenorf is always sort of sweating and getting very overexited anyway. Everything is actually going according to plan. Samson is walking deeper and deeper into this trap. So two or three days he keeps going. He still doesn't realize even as the Germans are attacking him on his flanks what he's doing. And then on the 28th of August, so about 4 days, 3 or 4 days into this battle, he realizes that something is wrong. Samson rides forward to see what's going on. And he leaves his communications technology behind which is a complete disaster for him. Now meanwhile, the Germans are closing the trap and they're basically closing in on this army in the forest. Samnoff's men could have maybe got out if they'd immediately withdrawn. Instead, very foolishly, they stand and fight. And that means the Germans are able to cut their lines of retreat and completely surround them, >> right? And so what happens now is a total bloodbath. Thousands upon thousands of the Russians are killed. The forests are strewn with bodies. For the next two days, um they tried to break out. They couldn't. They're lost. They're disoriented. They're terrified. And by the 30th of August, Samson's men are surrendering in their thousands. Often that they're just sitting in the woods with the kind of the hands in the air or hands on their heads. Thousands of them waiting to be captured. The Schlieffen plan had been all about trying to recreate the battle of Canai, Hannibal's great victory over the Romans that consisted in in surrounding an army and completely annihilating it on the Western Front. But as it turns out, the battle of Canai is replicated on the Eastern front at Tannenburg. >> Yeah. Very nice. >> Exactly the tactic, isn't it? >> Yeah. Closing the pinces of the trap. Yeah. >> Works brilliantly. So, Hindenburg and Ludenorf, we haven't actually mentioned yet our plan to do an investigative police drama with them as the detectives. >> They're going around on trains and they're smoking pipes and then when the need for action comes, they do their stuff. I think that'd be brilliant. >> Yeah. But if there's also a crime, they'll solve that on the way. Anyway, they have taken 92,000 prisoners. Um, and they had never imagined such a hall. The Kaiser rather lets himself down at this point. The Kaiser has a charming plan for the prisoners. He says, "I've got a brilliant idea. Why don't we corral them all on the Corland Peninsula in western Latvia and starve them all to death?" And actually, even Hindenburg Lindor said, "I think that's a bit much." Samson said with his asthma, he escaped in the woods with his entourage, with his cosac bodyguards. They left their maps behind very foolishly. They got completely lost in the woods and they tried to navigate using a compass like basically like sort of juke of Edinburgh award thing that's gone horribly wrong. >> Gone horribly wrong. Yeah. Samov can't breathe. He's very depressed. He says to his bodyguards, you know, the emperor trusted me. Nicholas II, how can I ever face him after this disaster? And then he basically goes off for a walk into the woods and they hear a gunshot and he's shot himself. >> Oh god. They're like Varys after using the Three Legions. >> Exactly. Exactly. Back in Germany. Total ecstasy because this is the point at which the battle of the man has started. The western offensive is faltering and the public are desperate for good news. Hinnenburgg says to the Kaiser, could we please name this after the battle of Tannenburg because of course they went past the village and that gives it tremendous resonance in Germany though the Tutonic Knights have avenged their historic defeat. They've thrown back the Asiatic hordes. The homeland has been saved. All of this now the job's not completely done. 10 days later they turn to Renamp in the north his first army. They try a similar trick actually the same trap. This time Renamp is expecting it. He is able to withdraw and so the Russians will end up withdrawing from East Prussia. However, they don't leave empty-handed. This is another aspect of the story I think that people don't know about by and large in English-sp speakaking countries. As the Russians retreated, they rounded up thousands of people basically as hostages. So, Max Hastings tells a very moving story about a family called the Shukas who um lived in a village called Popovven. There was a school teacher, his wife, and two daughters. Basically, I won't tell you the whole story, but they were taken by the Russians as hostages. They were taken off to Siberia and they didn't get home until 1920. >> Okay. So, again, a prefiguring there of the events of the Second World War and its aftermath. >> Exactly. Well, here's a real prefiguring. 10,000 Germans in total were rounded up and deported east in cattle trucks in horrendous conditions when the uh Russians left East Prussia. And what is more, I mean this was a real revelation to me actually inside the Russian Empire there were about 200,000 ethnic Germans, Russian subjects, Russian citizens. They were deported east as well. Some historians think maybe as many of as half of them died from disease, cold, starvation, and so on in the years that followed. I mean, this is a story that, you know, most of us have, I guess, have never heard of. Well, this is not the end at all of the campaign in the east. No, we got 3 years to go, right? Yeah. And the really confusing thing about all this is that a few weeks later, the Russians came back and they actually won some really big victories that nobody has ever heard of. The Battle of the Vistula. The Battle of Wuj. >> The Battle of what? >> Woj. It's an industrial town in uh sort of South Central Poland. >> No, I've literally never heard of that. >> It's spelled L O D Zed. You've seen that word. >> Lots. >> Yeah, you've seen that written down. >> I think Lods is how you pronounce it, don't >> I? I think not, Tom. >> Wood. This is the way the Eastern Front works. Now, putting that on one side, Hindenburg and Luzendorf are the huge winners from this. Hindenburg becomes a national idol almost unmatched, I think, in any other country. So in Berlin, people put up a 39 ft wooden statue of him. This was one of the nail men. Jesus, this is so interesting. You'd put up these statues made of wood and then you'd pay to hammer in a nail and the money would go to the armed forces. So there were hundreds of these nail men across Germany and Austria. You'd have Sief Freed, you'd have Charlemagne, you'd have Rolong, you'd have Henry the Lion, Ot the Great. Exactly. and you'd hammer in your nail, you know, and raise money for the war effort. Now, some German officers thought this was mad to give Hintenberg so much credit. They said he's the basically a clapped out pipe smoking woolus who's taking the credit for other people's successes. And Ludenorf's deputy later on used to give tours of the battle of Tannenburg. He was called Max Hoffman. And he would say, "This is where Phil Marshall Hindenberg slept before the battle. This is where he slept after the battle. And this is where he slept during the battle." Is that fair? No, actually. So, clearly Ludenorf is the real genius. Ludenorf is the master of detail, but Ludenorf is flaky and neurotic. Hindenburg with his unflapability and his jovial and stuff and his pipe smoking, he's the perfect foil. So, the way they work together and this is what makes them such a brilliant crime busting team. >> Correct. It's like Pero and Hastings or Spectre Morse and Lewis or Holmes and Watson. >> Yeah. the quiet, unflapable old pro puffing on his pipe and the eager young deputy who knows all about um kind of microscopes and blood stains and fingerprints and things. >> And the trouble is, of course, they've been tarnished by their later conduct in the 1920s and 30s when they they did behave disgracefully. >> Well, Ludenorf worse than Hindenburg. >> Yeah, Ludenorf worsen Hindenberg. Exactly. However, I think that makes it a tough cell to a streaming giant. >> Yes. Yes. Anyway, by the end of the year, Eric von Falinheine, who became the German supreme commander, he gives them a completely free hand in the east. And they set up something called Oberost. And that basically meant that they were now military dictators, these two guys, of the Baltic and of Bellarus and Eastern Poland, of the of the areas that were occupied by the Germans. And some historians say this was a dry run for Nazism because they're they behave very harshly and repressively and they have total contempt for the Slavs. I don't think that's fair. I don't think it is a dry run for Nazism. I think although they are repressive and ruthless, they're not genocidal. They don't have any, you know, program of kind of, you know, racial hygiene as the Nazis would have called it. >> They're killing people in the east, but not for Nazi reasons. >> Yeah, exactly. They're killing people for military reasons. Now, the Kaiser pretended he was thrilled by all this. He visited Obos to give them promotions. So, Hinderberg became a field marshal and so on. But the Kaiser is absolutely smoldering with jealousy. He's really jealous of Hindenburg and he absolutely despises Ludenorf. He says he's a dubious character eaten away by personal ambition. What great things is he supposed to have accomplished? I mean that's rich coming from the Kaiser. >> Well, I mean defeat the Russians. >> Yeah, defeat the Russians. Exactly. And of course, the great irony is that by the end of the war, the Kaiser will become their puppet because that's the real legacy of the Battle of Tannenburg. It gives power to these two men who think the war can be won on the battlefield, not with a negotiated settlement. So you could argue that in the long run, Tannenburgg is a disaster for Germany. It would be better for the Germans not to have won it in a way because the war would have been over more quickly perhaps with some form of negotiation. Who knows? And in the very long run, Tannenburgg has a a properly baleful afterlife because in 1927, the Germans built this huge memorial on the battlefield with eight towers was modeled on a cross between a Tutonic castle and the castle of Frederick II in Apulia in Italy. Hindenburg dedicated it personally before thousands and thousands of veterans and he gave this incredibly nationalistic speech in which he said the first world war was a noble crusade. You know, we were on the right side for the Nazis. Tannenburgg was a huge deal. In the first year, Hitler went all the big names when they had torch lit parades. When Hindenburg died in 1934, he was buried there. An even bigger deal, more torch lit parades. There was a shrine, basically a Nazi shrine with these two huge granite soldiers called the eternal watch. Oh, so like the Valad de los Kados. >> Yeah. the kind of fascist memorial to Franco in Spain >> or like the towers of the Argonath in the Lord of the Rings. You know, those two figures over the river Anduin. Anyway, >> but they're goodies, aren't they? >> They are goodies. So, it's a terrible comparison. >> Yeah. >> Um but as the Germans were retreating from East Prussia in 1945, the entire complex was blown up by the German soldiers and then every single trace was erased by the Polish communists afterwards. said that today nothing of it remains at all. >> That is looking far ahead into the future. But for now, we're we're still in 1914. So in today's episode, just to sum up, the Austrians have really messed things up in Serbia. The Germans have held the Russians off in East Prussia. But Dominic, is there more drama to come on the Eastern Front? And will it provide us with one final episode in this series on the war in 1914? It will indeed, Tom, and it's the most dramatic story of all. It is a titanic struggle in eastern Poland and Ukraine between the Austrians and the Russians. And at its center is the longest siege of the entire conflict, the Stalinrad of the First World War. And this, Tom, will be the beginning of the end for the Hapsburg Empire. I can't wait to hear it because I'm not going to be contributing anything cuz I literally have no idea what the stling of the First World War is. But Dominic, you know all of this like the back of your hand. I'm looking forward to hearing it. Rest is history club members can hear it right away.
