know a whole lot more beyond that so know a whole lot more beyond that so just sort of generally opening up our just sort of generally opening up our discussions before we get into details discussions before we get into details and the famine itself you know seems and the famine itself you know seems often times is written to it last from often times is written to it last from uh between uh between uh between 18 uh between 18 45 to 18 45 to 1852 what's important to know in the 1852 what's important to know in the general story of the Potato general story of the Potato Famine right so the the Irish Potato Famine right so the the Irish Potato Famine um was was we could talk about Famine um was was we could talk about what it means for a famine to be caused what it means for a famine to be caused uh later uh but in the kind of broadest uh later uh but in the kind of broadest sketches um from 1845 until about sketches um from 1845 until about 1851 um large sads of Ireland of of of 1851 um large sads of Ireland of of of Irish potato Fields were struck by uh Irish potato Fields were struck by uh epidemics of uh what's now called late epidemics of uh what's now called late blight uh which is a disease caused by a blight uh which is a disease caused by a fungus like organism uh called fop fungus like organism uh called fop infestans or P infestans um I'll I'll infestans or P infestans um I'll I'll stick to P infestans because I'm not stick to P infestans because I'm not even sure I've pronounced I've even sure I've pronounced I've pronounced its first name that that that pronounced its first name that that that uh that that well um and you know in the uh that that well um and you know in the course of those you know nearly half course of those you know nearly half decade of of potato blight uh you know decade of of potato blight uh you know close to a million people in Ireland close to a million people in Ireland died either of famine related causes or died either of famine related causes or from starvation from starvation from starvation itself uh and nearly as many as 2 or 3 itself uh and nearly as many as 2 or 3 million people million people million people immigrated um although it's not entirely immigrated um although it's not entirely clear you know there was a a census was clear you know there was a a census was taken in 1841 and a census was taken in taken in 1841 and a census was taken in 1840 in 1851 by the United Kingdom uh 1840 in 1851 by the United Kingdom uh and they found that you know the and they found that you know the population of Ireland had dropped by population of Ireland had dropped by nearly two million people um in the nearly two million people um in the course of of that decade uh which was course of of that decade uh which was really striking because the population really striking because the population in 1851 was lower even than the in 1851 was lower even than the population had been um in 1821 so population had been um in 1821 so uh yeah in the broadest Strokes that was uh yeah in the broadest Strokes that was the Irish potato fam in the that was the Irish potato fam in this this ecological political and this this ecological political and demographic catastrophe that struck demographic catastrophe that struck Ireland in the middle of the 19th Ireland in the middle of the 19th century and the people who left Ireland century and the people who left Ireland during this period of time and I guess during this period of time and I guess the decades after right this this has a the decades after right this this has a long a long effect this this isn't long a long effect this this isn't something that's just over in 1854 and something that's just over in 1854 and now well we're glad that's done this now well we're glad that's done this would have long-term effects did many would have long-term effects did many people who left um come is it is it did people who left um come is it is it did most of them come to United States most of them come to United States you're in you're in you're in Canada too yeah so like my it's pretty Canada too yeah so like my it's pretty St you know so my dad's family um you St you know so my dad's family um you know are are I mean everyone's Catholic know are are I mean everyone's Catholic but my my dad's family were are Irish but my my dad's family were are Irish Catholics um or Irish diasporic Catholics um or Irish diasporic Catholics um and so they're you know I Catholics um and so they're you know I think my great I was guess great great think my great I was guess great great grandparents on my dad's side I guess grandparents on my dad's side I guess wherever there were eight of them so wherever there were eight of them so they all came to Canada to Quebec um in they all came to Canada to Quebec um in the 1850s not during the famine but just the 1850s not during the famine but just after um and so you're right right the after um and so you're right right the the Potato Famine sets like the Ireland the Potato Famine sets like the Ireland has always been uh not always been has always been uh not always been nothing has always been anything but nothing has always been anything but Ireland for a very long time was a Ireland for a very long time was a country that produced a lot of country that produced a lot of immigrants um to to North America and immigrants um to to North America and elsewhere um even in the 18th century uh elsewhere um even in the 18th century uh you know a huge numbers of especially you know a huge numbers of especially Presbyterians from ster in the north of Presbyterians from ster in the north of Ireland uh came to what became the Ireland uh came to what became the United States to the point where I think United States to the point where I think something like 17 or 18% of the the non- something like 17 or 18% of the the non- enslaved population of the United States enslaved population of the United States in 1783 were were either Irish born or in 1783 were were either Irish born or or or of Irish descent um but that or or of Irish descent um but that phenomenon uh was exacerbated by the phenomenon uh was exacerbated by the famine and it was a kind of you know the famine and it was a kind of you know the the the pathways that were carved by the the pathways that were carved by immigrants in the 18th century were used immigrants in the 18th century were used in part uh in the 19th century but the in part uh in the 19th century but the famine set in motion a real Mass famine set in motion a real Mass migration out of Ireland to Australia uh migration out of Ireland to Australia uh to New Zealand to the United States and to New Zealand to the United States and to Canada uh and in some ways right like to Canada uh and in some ways right like the my my own family history uh you know the my my own family history uh you know the scandin are like famous in some ways the scandin are like famous in some ways famous cowards right and uh it's famous cowards right and uh it's surprising that uh you know the the uh surprising that uh you know the the uh in some ways like the people who went to in some ways like the people who went to traditional this this may be legendary traditional this this may be legendary but right the idea is like people wanted but right the idea is like people wanted to go to New York or Boston but if you to go to New York or Boston but if you ended up in Quebec and you didn't have ended up in Quebec and you didn't have the means to get to the United States the means to get to the United States you ended up staying um in places like you ended up staying um in places like Quebec City um in in in Montreal um in Quebec City um in in in Montreal um in the St Lawrence Valley right along kind the St Lawrence Valley right along kind of running North running just just north of running North running just just north of the of uh of the American Border um of the of uh of the American Border um yeah so that's yeah the the famine sat yeah so that's yeah the the famine sat in motion mass mass migration are is in motion mass mass migration are is there are there many Irish people in in there are there many Irish people in in the in in North America do you know and the in in North America do you know and I don't mean to get too far off track my I don't mean to get too far off track my my mom's maiden name is Bogan it used to my mom's maiden name is Bogan it used to be o Bogan but they dropped the O be o Bogan but they dropped the O because of the discrimination at the because of the discrimination at the time uh against the Irish you know when time uh against the Irish you know when you have a mass influx of migrants you have a mass influx of migrants coming in we know that story um is is is coming in we know that story um is is is is there a sizable population of of is there a sizable population of of Irish in North America I mean I Irish in North America I mean I think people claim you know I think like think people claim you know I think like I I don't I have this very Irish first I I don't I have this very Irish first name um and you know but I don't I think name um and you know but I don't I think of myself really as as as Canadian of myself really as as as Canadian rather than of of like sort of rather than of of like sort of attenuated Irish descent and in some attenuated Irish descent and in some ways this book was a ways this book was a was a way to uh work through in some was a way to uh work through in some ways that questions about about my own ways that questions about about my own not identity because I as I say I don't not identity because I as I say I don't I don't ident identify in quite the same I don't ident identify in quite the same way but um of of of ancestry I guess uh way but um of of of ancestry I guess uh there are certainly millions of people there are certainly millions of people who claim there there are far more who claim there there are far more people who claim Irish ancestry than people who claim Irish ancestry than there are people in Ireland uh by a there are people in Ireland uh by a factor of probably four or five um there factor of probably four or five um there are a lot of people in the Irish are a lot of people in the Irish diaspora and not that many people in the diaspora and not that many people in the Republic Ireland and and and uh Northern Republic Ireland and and and uh Northern Ireland in the in the United Kingdom and Ireland in the in the United Kingdom and the famine is a great driver of this the famine is a great driver of this diaspora yeah I mean both both and and diaspora yeah I mean both both and and not just in some ways not just in some ways like I'm working now on on some stuff like I'm working now on on some stuff about the the era of industrialization about the the era of industrialization uh that I kind of spun off from the work uh that I kind of spun off from the work I did for rot and one of the parts of I did for rot and one of the parts of that project is looking at the arrival that project is looking at the arrival of huge numbers of Irish it's not even of huge numbers of Irish it's not even really clear to call them it's not really clear to call them it's not really fair to call call them immigrants really fair to call call them immigrants because they're all it would be like it because they're all it would be like if you moved in Canada would be like if you moved in Canada from Ontario to Manitoba you wouldn't from Ontario to Manitoba you wouldn't say like I I immigrated to Manitoba uh say like I I immigrated to Manitoba uh because you're still within the same because you're still within the same country so if you're someone from the country so if you're someone from the Irish Countryside and you move to Irish Countryside and you move to Liverpool in 1840 before the famine Liverpool in 1840 before the famine you're not immigrating you're all within you're not immigrating you're all within the same country the same United Kingdom the same country the same United Kingdom uh but you know hundreds of thousands of uh but you know hundreds of thousands of people from Ireland move to British people from Ireland move to British cities as well um and really changed the cities as well um and really changed the character of urban life and and and character of urban life and and and workingclass life in in um in Britain in workingclass life in in um in Britain in industrial cities uh even as millions of industrial cities uh even as millions of immigrants are changing the demographics immigrants are changing the demographics and the labor relations and the and the labor relations and the structure of of of North American cities structure of of of North American cities as well and this is an important point as well and this is an important point an important part of the story in the an important part of the story in the 19th century I guess between 1801 and 19th century I guess between 1801 and 1922 to be more precise 1922 to be more precise the full all of Ireland is a part of the the full all of Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom that's right yeah um so United Kingdom that's right yeah um so Ireland is famously right it has this Ireland is famously right it has this complex long in some way like very tense complex long in some way like very tense often very um acrimonious but still often very um acrimonious but still weirdly kind of codependent relationship weirdly kind of codependent relationship to the island of Britain right these two to the island of Britain right these two is this this this archipelago um in the is this this this archipelago um in the North Atlantic um so Ireland is first North Atlantic um so Ireland is first notionally conquered by by anglo-norman notionally conquered by by anglo-norman Warlords basically in the in the 11th Warlords basically in the in the 11th and 12th centuries after the Norman and 12th centuries after the Norman invasion of England changes the invasion of England changes the structure of the English aristocracy um structure of the English aristocracy um but Ireland's like is claimed by England but Ireland's like is claimed by England for a very long time but the degree to for a very long time but the degree to which that claim is enforcable which that claim is enforcable fluctuates depending on the interest you fluctuates depending on the interest you know depending on the collaboration of know depending on the collaboration of Irish Aristocrats depending on the Irish Aristocrats depending on the degree to which the English crown or degree to which the English crown or later the British crown wants to assert later the British crown wants to assert authority over Ireland um so so you know authority over Ireland um so so you know there are there's this kind of up and there are there's this kind of up and down and I'm I'm not an expert on on down and I'm I'm not an expert on on medieval Irish history um and you know medieval Irish history um and you know sometimes historians of medieval Ireland sometimes historians of medieval Ireland can be extremely contentious so I don't can be extremely contentious so I don't want to say anything that I'll say want to say anything that I'll regret uh but by the anything that I'll regret uh but by the you know by Henry VII um in the early you know by Henry VII um in the early modern era wants to establish a more modern era wants to establish a more real um English presence in Ireland he real um English presence in Ireland he declares himself king of Ireland um and declares himself king of Ireland um and in his Reign and then shortly thereafter in his Reign and then shortly thereafter a series of the first what are called a series of the first what are called Plantation Plantation Plantation are attempted uh in in Ireland and their are attempted uh in in Ireland and their plantations although this is the same plantations although this is the same time roughly the same time when sugar time roughly the same time when sugar plantations are being established work plantations are being established work by enslaved people in the British by enslaved people in the British Caribbean in this sense Plantation is Caribbean in this sense Plantation is meant more like a plantation of a forest meant more like a plantation of a forest right it's a a saplings that are right it's a a saplings that are scattered in order to grow a forest uh scattered in order to grow a forest uh that'll later be cultivated and the idea that'll later be cultivated and the idea is you can introduce English or Scots is you can introduce English or Scots settlers to Ireland who will um sort of settlers to Ireland who will um sort of uh work to make real the notional claims uh work to make real the notional claims that England makes over Ireland right by that England makes over Ireland right by introducing a settler population you can introducing a settler population you can you can make real the Ang the you can make real the Ang the anglicization of of Ireland um and the anglicization of of Ireland um and the first monster plantation fails the most first monster plantation fails the most successful one is the one that's the successful one is the one that's the most famous which is the ster Plantation most famous which is the ster Plantation um which begins in the era of James I um which begins in the era of James I and around that era um and is entails and around that era um and is entails the mass migration of um you know tens the mass migration of um you know tens of thousands of Scots Presbyterians and of thousands of Scots Presbyterians and other British immigrants IM immigrants other British immigrants IM immigrants from the British from Britain proper uh from the British from Britain proper uh into the north of Ireland and is one of into the north of Ireland and is one of the reasons why you know the six the reasons why you know the six counties that make up Northern Ireland counties that make up Northern Ireland are still part of the United Kingdom as are still part of the United Kingdom as opposed to the Republic of Ireland um opposed to the Republic of Ireland um and so the ster Plantation exists this and so the ster Plantation exists this is a long-winded way to get to a to to is a long-winded way to get to a to to to get to a to get to a to important I told you before we began to important I told you before we began to take take space so I mean I mean the to take take space so I mean I mean the problem the the problem and I think the problem the the problem and I think the thing in in Irish history at least in thing in in Irish history at least in the history of Ireland's relationship to the history of Ireland's relationship to br is that everything is old like the br is that everything is old like the relationship and the complexity of the relationship and the complexity of the relationship has such deep roots um that relationship has such deep roots um that you know you might be talking about you know you might be talking about something proximate but there's all that something proximate but there's all that weight of History that's weighing down weight of History that's weighing down on on every kind of dispute and then in on on every kind of dispute and then in the 17th century is really the the 17th century is really the breakpoint and it's it's it's it's the breakpoint and it's it's it's it's the point that I take in in rot to be the point that I take in in rot to be the beginning of the real Colonial for more beginning of the real Colonial for more more formal quasi Colonial project in in more formal quasi Colonial project in in Ireland um so uh after the English Civil Ireland um so uh after the English Civil Wars in the 1640s Oliver cromwell's Wars in the 1640s Oliver cromwell's armies invade Ireland after the Glorious armies invade Ireland after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 uh as it's called in Revolution in 1688 uh as it's called in England uh William III William of England uh William III William of Orange's Army has invade Ireland and Orange's Army has invade Ireland and they make real in a sense what had they make real in a sense what had always been a claim that England uh had always been a claim that England uh had made over Ireland and then in the course made over Ireland and then in the course of the 18 century Ireland is not is not of the 18 century Ireland is not is not colonized it's not fair to call it a colonized it's not fair to call it a colony of Britain but I would say that colony of Britain but I would say that its relationship to Britain is colonial its relationship to Britain is colonial in so far as the Irish are the the bulk in so far as the Irish are the the bulk of the Irish population are Irish of the Irish population are Irish Catholics um the British Parliament Catholics um the British Parliament introduces a series of laws that introduces a series of laws that suppress Catholicism in Ireland um and suppress Catholicism in Ireland um and generally those laws are not that generally those laws are not that strictly enforced when it comes to strictly enforced when it comes to Everyday belief and practice um although Everyday belief and practice um although priests are sometimes rounded up and priests are sometimes rounded up and sometimes executed but people like sometimes executed but people like everyday people are not usually punished everyday people are not usually punished for being Catholic but they exist but if for being Catholic but they exist but if you are a Catholic landlord you lose you are a Catholic landlord you lose your land um so the L the they're called your land um so the L the they're called the penal laws and the penal the the the penal laws and the penal the the penal laws that are the most strictly penal laws that are the most strictly and assiduously inforced are the ones and assiduously inforced are the ones that involve taking away land from the that involve taking away land from the Catholic aristocracy and handing it over Catholic aristocracy and handing it over to a new mostly the kind of camp to a new mostly the kind of camp followers and soldiers and descendants followers and soldiers and descendants of soldiers in those armies especially of soldiers in those armies especially Williams William II's Army and so in the Williams William II's Army and so in the course of the 18th century Ireland course of the 18th century Ireland becomes this quasi colony of what's now becomes this quasi colony of what's now Great Britain because in 170 seven Great Britain because in 170 seven England and Wales which had been a England and Wales which had been a single Kingdom uh and Scotland which had single Kingdom uh and Scotland which had been a single Kingdom with the same King been a single Kingdom with the same King right so King James I uh was King of right so King James I uh was King of England and Wales and he was also King England and Wales and he was also King of Scotland but the two were too of Scotland but the two were too completely separate like one king two completely separate like one king two kingdoms uh in 1707 a new polity is kingdoms uh in 1707 a new polity is created called Great Britain uh and created called Great Britain uh and Great Britain includes England uh Great Britain includes England uh Scotland and Wales and Britain begins to Scotland and Wales and Britain begins to to more systematically uh extract rent to more systematically uh extract rent and uh import goods from Ireland uh and and uh import goods from Ireland uh and that happens throughout the 18th century that happens throughout the 18th century um then in the after the American war of um then in the after the American war of independence uh a kind of General fear independence uh a kind of General fear of similar Americas breaking out across of similar Americas breaking out across the British Empire takes place in the British Empire takes place in Ireland and in the 1780s the Irish Ireland and in the 1780s the Irish Parliament which had been basically Parliament which had been basically under the thumb of the British um under under the thumb of the British um under the thumb of of Britain's Parliament for the thumb of of Britain's Parliament for a very long time under a law called law a very long time under a law called law uh which allowed Westminster to uh which allowed Westminster to basically strike down any piece of basically strike down any piece of legislation that they didn't like coming legislation that they didn't like coming from the Irish Parliament and also from the Irish Parliament and also allowed the British Parliament to even allowed the British Parliament to even set the Parliamentary agenda of the set the Parliamentary agenda of the Irish Parliament uh that's repealed Irish Parliament uh that's repealed Ireland has this brief moment of Quasi Ireland has this brief moment of Quasi Independence as an independent Independence as an independent Parliament under a single crown and then Parliament under a single crown and then there's a rebellion concomitant with the there's a rebellion concomitant with the Napoleonic Wars in 1798 the United Irish Napoleonic Wars in 1798 the United Irish Rebellion um and after the united united Rebellion um and after the united united Irish Rebellion to get to a long to make Irish Rebellion to get to a long to make to make a very long story a little bit to make a very long story a little bit shorter um in 1800 and 1801 acts of shorter um in 1800 and 1801 acts of Union are passed under pressure from Union are passed under pressure from Westminster from from from London that Westminster from from from London that effectively dissolved the Irish effectively dissolved the Irish Parliament not effectively literally Parliament not effectively literally dissolve the Irish Parliament um and uh dissolve the Irish Parliament um and uh incorporate Ireland into a new poity the incorporate Ireland into a new poity the United Kingdom so the United Kingdom United Kingdom so the United Kingdom only dates to 1801 as a as a as a only dates to 1801 as a as a as a political um organism uh and under the political um organism uh and under the acts of Union Irish 100 Irish MPS sit in acts of Union Irish 100 Irish MPS sit in London um Irish Bishops of the Church of London um Irish Bishops of the Church of Ireland not not Catholic Bishops uh sit Ireland not not Catholic Bishops uh sit the Church of Ireland is the Anglican the Church of Ireland is the Anglican Church in Ireland uh sit in in the House Church in Ireland uh sit in in the House of Lords Irish Lords sit in the House of of Lords Irish Lords sit in the House of Lords and in the course of the you know Lords and in the course of the you know so Ireland is by the 1820s fully so Ireland is by the 1820s fully integrated um into the new United integrated um into the new United Kingdom there's a single currency in Kingdom there's a single currency in 1829 the last restrictions on Catholic 1829 the last restrictions on Catholic participation in British political life participation in British political life except for at the monarchical level are except for at the monarchical level are dissolved so you still can't have a dissolved so you still can't have a Catholic king of of of England but you Catholic king of of of England but you can have after 1829 a Catholic basically can have after 1829 a Catholic basically anything else um there's a single Market anything else um there's a single Market a single currency uh free movement uh a single currency uh free movement uh Ireland and England are one unit but the Ireland and England are one unit but the the remains of that Colonial the remains of that Colonial relationship are still there so Ireland relationship are still there so Ireland is still governed by a lord leftenant is still governed by a lord leftenant who is a kind of executive appointed in who is a kind of executive appointed in London with powers that are you know London with powers that are you know there are Lords left tenant in all of there are Lords left tenant in all of the English counties but they don't have the English counties but they don't have powers like they have in in in Dublin uh powers like they have in in in Dublin uh there are still lots of British Army there are still lots of British Army regiments stationed across Ireland um regiments stationed across Ireland um there's an instrument called the there's an instrument called the coercion act which is intended to be a coercion act which is intended to be a kind of piece of emergency legislation kind of piece of emergency legislation that's that allows the suspension of that's that allows the suspension of habus Corpus and other suspensions of habus Corpus and other suspensions of civil liberties in the case of emergency civil liberties in the case of emergency those are used something like 17 times those are used something like 17 times between 1801 and the famine so the between 1801 and the famine so the emergency legislation emergency legislation emergency legislation uh becomes routine um and Ireland uh becomes routine um and Ireland remains quasi within a kind of Quasi remains quasi within a kind of Quasi Colonial relationship constitutionally Colonial relationship constitutionally and it remains a major source of and it remains a major source of exported Goods uh especially exported Goods uh especially agricultural goods and rent in Britain agricultural goods and rent in Britain uh so that's a sorry that's a very very uh so that's a sorry that's a very very long answer but as I say like the past long answer but as I say like the past is always like that that long history is always like that that long history through the Middle Ages the early modern through the Middle Ages the early modern era the 18th century all of that is era the 18th century all of that is Weighing on the ARR the Constitutional Weighing on the ARR the Constitutional arrangement arrangement arrangement that Ireland and Britain find themselves that Ireland and Britain find themselves in on the eve of the Potato Famine so in on the eve of the Potato Famine so there's a long history between Ireland there's a long history between Ireland and let's just say London and let's just say London England but the England but the potato in Ireland does not have a long potato in Ireland does not have a long history the potato is not indigenous to history the potato is not indigenous to Ireland the potato is actually Ireland the potato is actually indigenous to here the the the Americas indigenous to here the the the Americas y yep uh so the potato is part of uh y yep uh so the potato is part of uh what historians sometimes call the what historians sometimes call the Colombian Exchange uh which was a very Colombian Exchange uh which was a very unequal biological exchange of basically unequal biological exchange of basically uh pathogens from Eurasia in exchange uh pathogens from Eurasia in exchange for highly useful food crops um from the for highly useful food crops um from the Americas so the Tomato right if you like Americas so the Tomato right if you like uh like this like so indelibly uh like this like so indelibly associated with Italy right the tomato associated with Italy right the tomato is not indigenous to Italy it's is not indigenous to Italy it's indigenous to the Americas the potato so indigenous to the Americas the potato so indelibly associated with Ireland with indelibly associated with Ireland with Northern Germany um you know that with Northern Germany um you know that with Poland right that is uh indigenous to Poland right that is uh indigenous to the Americas uh the the Americas uh the potato it is funny how we think about potato it is funny how we think about the potato in Ireland and Germany and the potato in Ireland and Germany and sort of as a European thing yeah but I sort of as a European thing yeah but I mean it's it's it's it's it's cultivated mean it's it's it's it's it's cultivated like the the the it's Peruvian right is like the the the it's Peruvian right is is really the the the first place where is really the the the first place where potatoes are systematically cultivated potatoes are systematically cultivated as a food crop and you know their as a food crop and you know their potatoes grow wild from Central America potatoes grow wild from Central America through Northern like the Andes and uh through Northern like the Andes and uh Central Mexico right um and so the Central Mexico right um and so the potato becomes a staple crop uh not potato becomes a staple crop uh not becomes a kind of famine back stop in becomes a kind of famine back stop in Europe um it's brought over uh by Europe um it's brought over uh by Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors uh Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors uh after the first Contact or the first after the first Contact or the first kind of like cataclysmic arrival of of kind of like cataclysmic arrival of of European disease and European um uh European disease and European um uh ambition uh in the Americas um and then ambition uh in the Americas um and then it's it's introduced gradually to it's it's introduced gradually to Ireland there's all kinds of Legends Ireland there's all kinds of Legends about it being introduced by like Sir about it being introduced by like Sir Walter Raleigh or Sir Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh or Sir Francis Drake and nobody really knows who did it it's I nobody really knows who did it it's I mean I think the most plausible account mean I think the most plausible account is that it was brought to Ireland by is that it was brought to Ireland by Basque fisherman from Northern Spain um Basque fisherman from Northern Spain um or from northern bass country uh who are or from northern bass country uh who are you know stopped in Ireland for fresh you know stopped in Ireland for fresh water um on their way to the Grand Banks water um on their way to the Grand Banks off the coast of what's now New Finland off the coast of what's now New Finland um so they would stop for potato anyway um so they would stop for potato anyway and it it started out as a kind of back and it it started out as a kind of back stop against uh the failure of other stop against uh the failure of other crops in Ireland but as this process of crops in Ireland but as this process of increasing increasing increasing colonialism uh in the 18th century colonialism uh in the 18th century picked up speed the potato became more picked up speed the potato became more and more a staple crop rather than a and more a staple crop rather than a fall back crop and so Irish farmers who fall back crop and so Irish farmers who peasants uh who might have been uh first peasants uh who might have been uh first of all they sort of ceased to be of all they sort of ceased to be peasants because there was no like small peasants because there was no like small Holdings became people stopped holding Holdings became people stopped holding stopped being small holders and became stopped being small holders and became uh rent paying tenants often on very uh rent paying tenants often on very small plots of land um and on those small plots of land um and on those small plots of land right the pressure small plots of land right the pressure of rent increased as the landlord as the of rent increased as the landlord as the population of Ireland increased as the population of Ireland increased as the the demands of the British export Market the demands of the British export Market increased uh land became more and more increased uh land became more and more subdivided and potatoes emerged as a subdivided and potatoes emerged as a solution to the problem of an export solution to the problem of an export oriented economy That was supposed to oriented economy That was supposed to produce both food products for export produce both food products for export and also rent for landlords uh but at and also rent for landlords uh but at the same time didn't have a lot of the same time didn't have a lot of capital investment didn't have was had capital investment didn't have was had had this Catholic population who were had this Catholic population who were considered to be if not like on the considered to be if not like on the fringes of civilization at Best by many fringes of civilization at Best by many British observers and so potatoes were a British observers and so potatoes were a subsistence crop that made possible a subsistence crop that made possible a very sophisticated and throughout the very sophisticated and throughout the 18th and 19th century increasingly 18th and 19th century increasingly sophisticated and increasingly sophisticated and increasingly integrated export Market uh and so the integrated export Market uh and so the potato became the symbol of Ireland in potato became the symbol of Ireland in part because the Irish came to depend on part because the Irish came to depend on it in order to survive the rigors of the it in order to survive the rigors of the Imperial economy and then after the Imperial economy and then after the active Union the rigors of the economy active Union the rigors of the economy of the Union of the Union this is letters and politics and we are this is letters and politics and we are in conversation with Patrick X scandin in conversation with Patrick X scandin associate professor at the center for associate professor at the center for industrial relations and human resources industrial relations and human resources at the center for diaspora and at the center for diaspora and transnational studies at the University transnational studies at the University of Toronto he is the author of the book of Toronto he is the author of the book rot an imperial history of the Irish rot an imperial history of the Irish famine so this is a story of capitalism famine so this is a story of capitalism I couldn't help you point it out earlier I couldn't help you point it out earlier and I was thinking about this When I Was and I was thinking about this When I Was preparing for a conversation when I'm preparing for a conversation when I'm thinking about the potato in Ireland I thinking about the potato in Ireland I couldn't help but think of uh sugarcane couldn't help but think of uh sugarcane uh in the Caribbean and in Haiti and and uh in the Caribbean and in Haiti and and that history that history that history there yeah I mean that's you know in there yeah I mean that's you know in some ways that's the I can't you know I some ways that's the I can't you know I spent the first part you know I wrote spent the first part you know I wrote previous to WR two books about British previous to WR two books about British slavery and anti-slavery U and about the slavery and anti-slavery U and about the transition from enslave to Free Labor in transition from enslave to Free Labor in the British Caribbean and about the the British Caribbean and about the origins and politics of anti-slavery in origins and politics of anti-slavery in Britain itself um and there's there are Britain itself um and there's there are some like in some ways there some like in some ways there are there are similarities right um in are there are similarities right um in just in terms of the extraction not in just in terms of the extraction not in terms of the labor because one of the terms of the labor because one of the things about plantation labor but and things about plantation labor but and and slave labor in the British Caribbean and slave labor in the British Caribbean is that it is unbelievably Capital is that it is unbelievably Capital intensive um you know it it it relies on intensive um you know it it it relies on what historians sometimes and what historians sometimes and abolitionist called the chatt principle abolitionist called the chatt principle right the absolute the the the idea that right the absolute the the the idea that enslaved people could be exchanged at enslaved people could be exchanged at time for money that they were themselves time for money that they were themselves uh kind of units of capital that uh kind of units of capital that appreciated or depreciated could always appreciated or depreciated could always be exchanged had basically no Val like be exchanged had basically no Val like we're we're there to be sold right and we're we're there to be sold right and that that that salability uh was of a piece with the salability uh was of a piece with the overall capitalization of the Caribbean overall capitalization of the Caribbean economy where so to set up a sugar economy where so to set up a sugar plantage there's a historian I think plantage there's a historian I think it's the historian uh John mcneel who it's the historian uh John mcneel who said like a sugar Plantation is an said like a sugar Plantation is an incredibly uh energy and money intensive incredibly uh energy and money intensive way of turning sunlight into money right way of turning sunlight into money right so you need lots of money to set up a so you need lots of money to set up a plantation lots of capital um uh and but plantation lots of capital um uh and but but in the end right the the the the but in the end right the the the the plantations extract right they extract plantations extract right they extract um sugar and they extract the revenues um sugar and they extract the revenues from all of the many many many other from all of the many many many other Industries Financial Industries Industries Financial Industries Insurance Industries commercial Insurance Industries commercial industries that uh are associated with industries that uh are associated with the sugar economy so in that sense in the sugar economy so in that sense in the 18th Century right as the sugar the 18th Century right as the sugar economies of the Caribbean are booming economies of the Caribbean are booming Ireland is being subjected not to the Ireland is being subjected not to the same kinds of forces because one of the same kinds of forces because one of the kind of sort of toxic myths of the Irish kind of sort of toxic myths of the Irish diaspora is the idea that the Irish were diaspora is the idea that the Irish were enslaved by Britain which is like enslaved by Britain which is like categorically untrue um and I think in categorically untrue um and I think in some ways is used um to some ways is used um to by sometimes used by members of the by sometimes used by members of the Irish diaspora to kind of launder their Irish diaspora to kind of launder their own uh racism right they say like well own uh racism right they say like well we overcame slave y right but the Irish we overcame slave y right but the Irish weren't enslaved right they they they weren't enslaved right they they they were enslaved by the Vikings but you were enslaved by the Vikings but you know not in a like in a very know not in a like in a very different kind of system than the that's different kind of system than the that's that's not what Irish people usually that's not what Irish people usually mean or Irish diaspora people usually mean or Irish diaspora people usually mean when they say we were the first mean when they say we were the first slaves they're not they don't mean of slaves they're not they don't mean of the Vikings right they mean of the the Vikings right they mean of the British Empire um so that that didn't British Empire um so that that didn't happen so Ireland didn't have slavery it happen so Ireland didn't have slavery it had a free labor economy but it was had a free labor economy but it was similarly and it didn't have a lot of similarly and it didn't have a lot of capital in fact it was was capital in fact it was was systematically starved of capital um but systematically starved of capital um but the so the Irish labor force were were the so the Irish labor force were were were wage laborers but they're among the were wage laborers but they're among the lowest page wage laborers in the British lowest page wage laborers in the British Empire um and Ireland was producing Empire um and Ireland was producing something for the British economy and so something for the British economy and so in that since the Caribbean and Ireland in that since the Caribbean and Ireland these two um it was in inevitable that these two um it was in inevitable that people would draw comparisons between people would draw comparisons between them um and those comparisons them um and those comparisons intensified after emancipation in the intensified after emancipation in the British Caribbean because after the British Caribbean because after the Caribbean after formerly enslaved people Caribbean after formerly enslaved people became wage laborers in the British became wage laborers in the British Caribbean then all of a sudden political Caribbean then all of a sudden political economists in Britain started to see the economists in Britain started to see the recently emancipated sugar cane recently emancipated sugar cane plantation worker being paid a pittance plantation worker being paid a pittance as being sort of civilization equivalent as being sort of civilization equivalent to the Irish peasant farmer surviving on to the Irish peasant farmer surviving on potatoes raising pigs for money and both potatoes raising pigs for money and both like both kind of like intractable both like both kind of like intractable both in need of discipline both unlikely to in need of discipline both unlikely to recognize the sort of uh values of the recognize the sort of uh values of the emerging Victorian Bourgeois right of emerging Victorian Bourgeois right of accumulation of wage dependence of uh accumulation of wage dependence of uh work ethic right so in in that sense work ethic right so in in that sense there are a lot of parallels but I just there are a lot of parallels but I just like this is another kind of long-winded like this is another kind of long-winded answer because I wanted to make sure answer because I wanted to make sure that I sort of parsed out the fact that that I sort of parsed out the fact that people are not comparing Irish laborers people are not comparing Irish laborers to enslave laborers but they are to enslave laborers but they are comparing the position of Ireland within comparing the position of Ireland within the Empire as an island producing stuff the Empire as an island producing stuff for Britain to the position of the for Britain to the position of the Caribbean except the Caribbean is vastly Caribbean except the Caribbean is vastly more valuable more valuable more valuable um and in many ways much less um and in many ways much less Troublesome uh there are spectacular Troublesome uh there are spectacular slave rebellions on the eve of slave rebellions on the eve of emancipation um but you know in some emancipation um but you know in some ways like Rebellion I think for many ways like Rebellion I think for many administrators of the British Caribbean administrators of the British Caribbean Rebellion is seen as the price of such a Rebellion is seen as the price of such a profitable Imperial possession um and profitable Imperial possession um and Ireland it's it's not always clear I Ireland it's it's not always clear I think to British administrators what think to British administrators what Ireland actually contributes to Britain Ireland actually contributes to Britain um yeah but we can talk more about that um yeah but we can talk more about that if it's if it's interesting I want to if it's if it's interesting I want to ask about this in 1845 again this I ask about this in 1845 again this I guess it's a fungus that comes and and guess it's a fungus that comes and and and and attacks these potatoes it causes and and attacks these potatoes it causes the potatoes to rot late in the growing the potatoes to rot late in the growing cycle my understanding is which I cycle my understanding is which I imagine is devastating because you think imagine is devastating because you think it's all going good and then at the very it's all going good and then at the very end you have this rotted potato uh in end you have this rotted potato uh in the ground that you can't rely on this the ground that you can't rely on this wasn't a fungus that was just unique to wasn't a fungus that was just unique to Ireland this was all through Europe and Ireland this was all through Europe and it was devastating to Europe but nothing it was devastating to Europe but nothing like it was in Ireland like it was in Ireland that's right yeah so it's it's it's a a that's right yeah so it's it's it's a a fungus like water mold so it behaves fungus like water mold so it behaves like a fungus but mycologists would uh like a fungus but mycologists would uh and certainly people who saw it under and certainly people who saw it under microscopes in the microscopes in the 1840s thought that it looked very much 1840s thought that it looked very much like a fungus it has certain differences like a fungus it has certain differences which I frankly I'm not entirely clear which I frankly I'm not entirely clear on myself um uh but that are of on myself um uh but that are of significance to to mycologists um yeah significance to to mycologists um yeah so it's it it it like the potato is so it's it it it like the potato is native to places where potatoes grow native to places where potatoes grow um but unlike in say the Central Valley um but unlike in say the Central Valley uh the central kind of volcanic valleys uh the central kind of volcanic valleys outside of Mexico City which certain outside of Mexico City which certain some plant geneticists think is the kind some plant geneticists think is the kind of point of origin of pinfest the of point of origin of pinfest the organism that causes late light um you organism that causes late light um you know in there there's a lot more gen at know in there there's a lot more gen at least at the time right there a lot more least at the time right there a lot more genetic diversity amongst potatoes genetic diversity amongst potatoes because there are potatoes that are because there are potatoes that are grown systematically by Farmers but grown systematically by Farmers but there are also potatoes that grow wild there are also potatoes that grow wild um and that genetic diversity makes the um and that genetic diversity makes the plants more uh resilient in the face of plants more uh resilient in the face of pathogens um it's also a drier climate pathogens um it's also a drier climate um and water molds like pestan Thrive um and water molds like pestan Thrive not I mean there're it's it's a bit sort not I mean there're it's it's a bit sort of contradictory because not all water of contradictory because not all water water molds thrive in wet conditions but water molds thrive in wet conditions but this one does um and so like in some this one does um and so like in some ways the conditions for the flourishing ways the conditions for the flourishing of this organism were better um in of this organism were better um in wetter parts of Western Europe than they wetter parts of Western Europe than they were in the Americas um but yeah this were in the Americas um but yeah this this this organism comes it it still is this this organism comes it it still is a major uh problem for potato a major uh problem for potato agriculture uh it's now prevented with agriculture uh it's now prevented with uh the application of fungicides and uh the application of fungicides and compounds like um copper sulfate which compounds like um copper sulfate which is generally used as a as a as a is generally used as a as a as a fungicide in a lot of agricultural fungicide in a lot of agricultural Industries uh but it's still really Industries uh but it's still really really expensive uh you'll still find really expensive uh you'll still find potatoes that have been bladed right if potatoes that have been bladed right if you cut open a potato and it's got a you cut open a potato and it's got a hole in the middle and the hole is kind hole in the middle and the hole is kind of like re eaten out it's either been of like re eaten out it's either been eaten by a pest or um it's been being eaten by a pest or um it's been being consumed by by by pinfest ANS or a consumed by by by pinfest ANS or a similar organism um and it strikes late similar organism um and it strikes late in the growing season so in in Ireland in the growing season so in in Ireland uh potatoes are you know as our potatoes uh potatoes are you know as our potatoes are stored underground um they're stored are stored underground um they're stored in pits that are dug in the ground in pits that are dug in the ground during during the Harvest at least at during during the Harvest at least at this time they're lined with Ash or with this time they're lined with Ash or with straw and the potatoes are piled in on straw and the potatoes are piled in on top of them and you put dirt on top and top of them and you put dirt on top and that stores the potatoes pretty well um that stores the potatoes pretty well um but one of the most Insidious features but one of the most Insidious features of late blight for Ireland was that it's of late blight for Ireland was that it's strikes not just potatoes buried in the strikes not just potatoes buried in the ground so you imagine right um Farmers ground so you imagine right um Farmers digging up their potatoes and finding digging up their potatoes and finding their whole Fields destroyed uh and in their whole Fields destroyed uh and in some ways it wasn't that a a surprise some ways it wasn't that a a surprise because late light strikes the entire because late light strikes the entire plant so you could see the whole field plant so you could see the whole field these kind of fields of potatoes just these kind of fields of potatoes just dying it spreads really quickly um to dying it spreads really quickly um to this day right the Irish Weather Service this day right the Irish Weather Service the in the Irish Republic provides like the in the Irish Republic provides like a a a blight uh forecast for Farmers um a a a blight uh forecast for Farmers um of the relative sporulation of of this of the relative sporulation of of this organism to tell them when to apply organism to tell them when to apply fungicides and when not um and strike fungicides and when not um and strike strikes late in the growing season and strikes late in the growing season and it strikes potatoes buried in the ground it strikes potatoes buried in the ground um and so you know when the potato crop um and so you know when the potato crop was destroyed imagine not just the crop was destroyed imagine not just the crop itself but stuff that had already been itself but stuff that had already been Unearthed right so in in October of 1845 Unearthed right so in in October of 1845 right people knew when they dug up their right people knew when they dug up their potatoes uhoh these potatoes are dead potatoes uhoh these potatoes are dead right uh and that would be pretty late right uh and that would be pretty late in the Harvest October November uh in the Harvest October November uh people would start digging up their people would start digging up their potatoes in in August but then they go potatoes in in August but then they go in November to break open a pit of in November to break open a pit of potatoes that they buried in August and potatoes that they buried in August and find that they've been blighted too um find that they've been blighted too um and so that was the you know that was and so that was the you know that was the the the thing that it just that was the the the thing that it just that was one of the features of the organism and one of the features of the organism and the features of the the pathogen that the features of the the pathogen that made the the blate blade especially made the the blate blade especially devastating uh is that it destroyed both devastating uh is that it destroyed both growing and stored potatoes and and growing and stored potatoes and and during and this obviously in in a famine during and this obviously in in a famine because they're so dependent now on the because they're so dependent now on the potato but but you also right it it's potato but but you also right it it's not that there's not any other crops in not that there's not any other crops in Ireland but they're being forcibly used Ireland but they're being forcibly used as as as exports even exports even exports even and yeah and and not even forcibly right and yeah and and not even forcibly right it's it's it's not you know I think it's it's it's not you know I think there's this like there's this like the the principle of rent is so like the the principle of rent is so like that's one of the points I try to make that's one of the points I try to make throughout the book what do you mean throughout the book what do you mean by rent like I I I I what do you mean by rent like I I I I mean I mean literal rent on land um so mean I mean literal rent on land um so the Irish like one of the points I try the Irish like one of the points I try to make in in rot is that the Irish to make in in rot is that the Irish economy looks old because it's low economy looks old because it's low technology it's low capital and Ireland technology it's low capital and Ireland is still you know it's still like rural is still you know it's still like rural Ireland is incredibly picturesque right Ireland is incredibly picturesque right it looks it looks old it looks like it looks it looks old it looks like stepping back in time the kind of like stepping back in time the kind of like Stone Hedge rows and undulating fields Stone Hedge rows and undulating fields and you can still see like the in some and you can still see like the in some Fields the kind of wave of um potato Fields the kind of wave of um potato lazy bed cultivation as it's called lazy bed cultivation as it's called these kind a very um like Iron Age Roman these kind a very um like Iron Age Roman age method of growing tubers in pits um age method of growing tubers in pits um that are anyway but you know in fact the that are anyway but you know in fact the the economy is extremely modern um and the economy is extremely modern um and extremely it is not it is capital poor extremely it is not it is capital poor but it is capitalistic definitely um and but it is capitalistic definitely um and so Ireland is owned by a relatively so Ireland is owned by a relatively small number of people um who are not small number of people um who are not entirely but mostly Protestant and who entirely but mostly Protestant and who are not entirely but predominantly are not entirely but predominantly landlords who acquired their land in the landlords who acquired their land in the wake of the 17th century conquests and a wake of the 17th century conquests and a lot of those landlords don't live in lot of those landlords don't live in Ireland there are exceptions some Ireland there are exceptions some landlords are good uh or better than landlords are good uh or better than others um but because Ireland doesn't others um but because Ireland doesn't have a lot of capital and it doesn't have a lot of capital and it doesn't have the kinds of people who in England have the kinds of people who in England would be called Farmers so if you hear would be called Farmers so if you hear the word farmer in 18 century or 19th the word farmer in 18 century or 19th century England don't imagine sort of a century England don't imagine sort of a rustic I mean they might be a rustic rustic I mean they might be a rustic person but this is somebody with money person but this is somebody with money uh because in irel in England Farmers uh because in irel in England Farmers rent land on long-term leases from rent land on long-term leases from Aristocrats and often pull their Capital Aristocrats and often pull their Capital with Aristocrats to improve the land um with Aristocrats to improve the land um and then hire laborers to manage it and and then hire laborers to manage it and professional managers to manage it and professional managers to manage it and and sometimes these Farms are a thousand and sometimes these Farms are a thousand 2,000 acres um in size they're really 2,000 acres um in size they're really substantial industries in Ireland substantial industries in Ireland they're much smaller and part because they're much smaller and part because people don't have money like there's people don't have money like there's just much less capital in the Irish just much less capital in the Irish economy and so Farms are smaller and as economy and so Farms are smaller and as the but rents are not connected like the the but rents are not connected like the rent that that farmers smaller Farmers rent that that farmers smaller Farmers imagine somebody renting say 50 acres of imagine somebody renting say 50 acres of land instead of a thousand right that land instead of a thousand right that land the rent is not connected to the land the rent is not connected to the what the land can produce the rent is what the land can produce the rent is connected to what the market will bear connected to what the market will bear and what people will pay um it it floats and what people will pay um it it floats free of the actual produce of the land free of the actual produce of the land and so rents in the 18th century start and so rents in the 18th century start to climb up or and I mean they're to climb up or and I mean they're comparatively low compared to England comparatively low compared to England but compared to the amount the but compared to the amount the productivity of Irish land they're very productivity of Irish land they're very high and so Irish land is chopped up high and so Irish land is chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces and into smaller and smaller pieces and becomes a kind of like a pyramid scheme becomes a kind of like a pyramid scheme in a way uh although there is ultimately in a way uh although there is ultimately an underlying asset that's being the an underlying asset that's being the like agricultural produce where like agricultural produce where landlords at the top aristocratic landlords at the top aristocratic landlords at the top collect rent from landlords at the top collect rent from smaller farmers who collect rent from smaller farmers who collect rent from smaller farmers who collect rent from people who are called conacre Farmers um people who are called conacre Farmers um who rent uh as sometimes as little as an who rent uh as sometimes as little as an acre or less of land um basically just acre or less of land um basically just to grow potatoes for subsistance um who to grow potatoes for subsistance um who themselves sometimes rent a cottage to themselves sometimes rent a cottage to people who are even lower so this is an people who are even lower so this is an economy where everybody is a landlord of economy where everybody is a landlord of some kind everybody is collecting rent some kind everybody is collecting rent from someone else and all that money is from someone else and all that money is Flowing upward um and those rents are Flowing upward um and those rents are not at all connected to the to the not at all connected to the to the productivity of the land but to the productivity of the land but to the market itself and as the population of market itself and as the population of Ireland grows um the uh pressure on land Ireland grows um the uh pressure on land increases and rents increase um and the increases and rents increase um and the potato makes it possible to survive in potato makes it possible to survive in this economy because it grows pretty this economy because it grows pretty well uh it yields it can offer big well uh it yields it can offer big yields and small amounts of yields and small amounts of and it can it is you know but yeah it's and it can it is you know but yeah it's it's and you can survive like a a diet it's and you can survive like a a diet of potatoes and water is not entirely of potatoes and water is not entirely nutritionally adequate but it kept a lot nutritionally adequate but it kept a lot of Irish people alive uh millions of of Irish people alive uh millions of people alive so it clearly is it's people alive so it clearly is it's without you know it's lots of vitamins without you know it's lots of vitamins and potatoes like I'm not it's not and potatoes like I'm not it's not stealth marketing from the potato lobby stealth marketing from the potato lobby but they are nutritionally uh they're but they are nutritionally uh they're nutritionally rich foods um and so right nutritionally rich foods um and so right like so this made it possible like like so this made it possible like people couldn't eat the other stuff that people couldn't eat the other stuff that they grew so if you were somebody who they grew so if you were somebody who was a conic or farmer you ate potatoes was a conic or farmer you ate potatoes and for wages you usually would work on and for wages you usually would work on a bigger Farm uh where you would or you a bigger Farm uh where you would or you would sell a pig uh or you would work uh would sell a pig uh or you would work uh for a graser like milking or hurting for a graser like milking or hurting cows um or cutting grass and you would cows um or cutting grass and you would be paid either in a small amount of be paid either in a small amount of wages or in land for potatoes uh and you wages or in land for potatoes uh and you would not actually consume any of the would not actually consume any of the things that you produced on the farms things that you produced on the farms that you work on so you have the that you work on so you have the situation where people would like 90 situation where people would like 90 million eggs were being exported on the million eggs were being exported on the eve of the famine from Ireland to eve of the famine from Ireland to England or to Britain but many Irish England or to Britain but many Irish people not all Irish people but the people not all Irish people but the people who are like very poor and had people who are like very poor and had chickens wouldn't eat any of the eggs chickens wouldn't eat any of the eggs their chickens laid they would sell them their chickens laid they would sell them and so they just survived so the potato and so they just survived so the potato like was the kind of like the the the like was the kind of like the the the lubrication of this extraordinarily lubrication of this extraordinarily exploitative economy um that made it exploitative economy um that made it possible for people and and people like possible for people and and people like couldn't break free of it um they couldn't break free of it um they because they had to make their rent or because they had to make their rent or they'd be evicted and if they were they'd be evicted and if they were evicted they would have to leave or they evicted they would have to leave or they would die um and so you know they were would die um and so you know they were in a situation where the potato made it in a situation where the potato made it possible to survive from season to possible to survive from season to season and sometimes made it possible to season and sometimes made it possible to survive with a very generous and survive with a very generous and adequate supply of food so you didn't adequate supply of food so you didn't have to worry about food but you always have to worry about food but you always had to worry about rent I wonder I I've had to worry about rent I wonder I I've heard it said that the what was heard it said that the what was happening generally in Europe with happening generally in Europe with potato because again this affects large potato because again this affects large area of of of of the continent not just area of of of of the continent not just Ireland most Ireland's mostly affected Ireland most Ireland's mostly affected as we're talking about but but affects as we're talking about but but affects everyone and that this might have been everyone and that this might have been one of the driving forces that led to one of the driving forces that led to the revolts and the Revolutions in 18 the revolts and the Revolutions in 18 1848 um do you get a Revolt in Ireland 1848 um do you get a Revolt in Ireland at all against how this was working out at all against how this was working out or or are you it could be Beyond this as or or are you it could be Beyond this as well but I'm also wondering well but I'm also wondering when you're in a when you're in a famine a serious famine and things are famine a serious famine and things are so desperate is is it even possible to so desperate is is it even possible to revolt in that kind of St so so there is revolt in that kind of St so so there is a lot of violence in the famine um a lot of violence in the famine um that's localized there are a lot of that's localized there are a lot of raids on especially um you know one of raids on especially um you know one of the things that when they're paying out the things that when they're paying out so one of the programs that the UK so one of the programs that the UK government introduces in Ireland it government introduces in Ireland it spends a lot of money on for very little spends a lot of money on for very little effect is a program of Public Works um effect is a program of Public Works um and the Public Works wages are paid in and the Public Works wages are paid in cash uh but one of the things that the cash uh but one of the things that the Commissioners have to do when they send Commissioners have to do when they send out the money to pay the wages is they out the money to pay the wages is they send out three identical coaches because send out three identical coaches because there's so many robberies of the coaches there's so many robberies of the coaches in the and there's so many robberies of in the and there's so many robberies of potato shipments of grain shipments of potato shipments of grain shipments of steam ships right there's a lot of steam ships right there's a lot of violence in potato famine but it's not violence in potato famine but it's not revolutionary violence there are a group revolutionary violence there are a group however of um Irish intellectual ual s however of um Irish intellectual ual s um one of them is a very pretty um one of them is a very pretty prominent parliamentarian in William prominent parliamentarian in William Smith O'Brien um who break who are part Smith O'Brien um who break who are part of um the Irish early Irish nationalist of um the Irish early Irish nationalist movement which is called the repeal movement which is called the repeal movement uh and the repeal movement is movement uh and the repeal movement is strongly associated with one of the strongly associated with one of the great Heroes of 19th century Irish great Heroes of 19th century Irish history Daniel Connell the emancipator history Daniel Connell the emancipator they call him because he led the

one of the kind of secular um and one of the kind of dividing lines sorry again this is again dividing lines sorry again this is again it's always the weight of history on the it's always the weight of history on the on these pasts one of the dividing lines on these pasts one of the dividing lines in in Ireland that starts to split uh in in Ireland that starts to split uh and in some ways it's quite clever on and in some ways it's quite clever on the part of Robert peele's conservative the part of Robert peele's conservative government in the United Kingdom is to government in the United Kingdom is to propose a series of secular universities propose a series of secular universities for Ireland that would be called the for Ireland that would be called the Queens colleges and they still

major cities because there was already major cities because there was already Trinity College in Dublin which was the Trinity College in Dublin which was the um the um the um the College uh in in in of longing in Dublin College uh in in in of longing in Dublin and then there's uh May what's now Mayu and then there's uh May what's now Mayu University it was then St Patrick's I University it was then St Patrick's I think um College which was a Catholic think um College which was a Catholic Seminary uh and so by proposing this Seminary uh and so by proposing this legislation to introduce these secular legislation to introduce these secular universities um it creates a split in universities um it creates a split in the repeal movement where the people who the repeal movement where the people who become known as the young irelanders become known as the young irelanders propose a kind of um more romantic propose a kind of um more romantic nationalism on the model of the kind nationalism on the model of the kind that that that's being promoted on the that that that's being promoted on the continent in Europe the kind that continent in Europe the kind that motivates the Revolutions of 1848 um and motivates the Revolutions of 1848 um and they're even called young Ireland as a they're even called young Ireland as a kind of insult at first as a Akin to kind of insult at first as a Akin to Young Italy but they adopted as as their Young Italy but they adopted as as their badge right they are young Ireland and badge right they are young Ireland and in 1848 just after the most brutal year in 1848 just after the most brutal year of the famine um the young irelanders of the famine um the young irelanders after you know the because of a wave of after you know the because of a wave of of violence in the wake of the famine of violence in the wake of the famine Britain increases its coercive powers Britain increases its coercive powers like it introduces coercion act it like it introduces coercion act it starts shutting down um Irish starts shutting down um Irish nationalist newspapers it starts nationalist newspapers it starts arresting nationalists and in response arresting nationalists and in response the young irelanders declare rebellion the young irelanders declare rebellion and at first it looks like and this is and at first it looks like and this is something I I look at I kind of try to something I I look at I kind of try to narrate in rot at first there are these narrate in rot at first there are these reports in the British press that like reports in the British press that like kileny is Fallen right cork is going to kileny is Fallen right cork is going to fall right then and in the the pantheon fall right then and in the the pantheon of of the Irish later Irish of of the Irish later Irish revolutionaries and nationalists like um revolutionaries and nationalists like um cork is like the seat and Kilkenny are cork is like the seat and Kilkenny are these like kind of these like kind of uh heartlands of of republicanism um and uh heartlands of of republicanism um and you know they have that kind of you know they have that kind of reputation or that reputation doesn't reputation or that reputation doesn't come to fruition at this time right come to fruition at this time right because the young irelanders March there because the young irelanders March there they try they think they have like some they try they think they have like some armed followers they think they're going armed followers they think they're going to be able to raise a kind of General to be able to raise a kind of General peasant Rebellion but it doesn't happen peasant Rebellion but it doesn't happen and the only Battle of the 1848 and the only Battle of the 1848 Rebellion um happens at a farmhouse in Rebellion um happens at a farmhouse in the countryside in the south of in the the countryside in the south of what's now the Republic of south of what's now the Republic of Ireland where a group of police officers Ireland where a group of police officers take shelter inside of a farmhouse they take shelter inside of a farmhouse they have guns the people outside don't have have guns the people outside don't have many guns they start to they're going to many guns they start to they're going to but they move to set fire to the house but they move to set fire to the house from the outside the police shoot one of from the outside the police shoot one of the people outside and the crowd the people outside and the crowd disperses and that's it uh the young disperses and that's it uh the young irelanders are arrested the ones who are irelanders are arrested the ones who are there uh many of them are transported um there uh many of them are transported um so they're sent to um uh William Smith so they're sent to um uh William Smith O'Brien is sent to uh the Australian O'Brien is sent to uh the Australian penal colonies where he's received as a penal colonies where he's received as a hero um and he hands up returning later hero um and he hands up returning later to England where he's pardoned right so to England where he's pardoned right so in a certain sense like a lot of the in a certain sense like a lot of the revolutionaries of 1848 in revolutionaries of 1848 in Ireland continue in some ways some of Ireland continue in some ways some of them become a like leave political life them become a like leave political life afterwards some of them go to the United afterwards some of them go to the United States and in the United States some of States and in the United States some of them become involved with the Athenian them become involved with the Athenian Brotherhood which becomes the kind of Brotherhood which becomes the kind of secret underground organization that's secret underground organization that's associated with the emerging Irish associated with the emerging Irish Republican Brotherhood which becomes Republican Brotherhood which becomes later is one of the ancestors of the later is one of the ancestors of the Irish Republican Army um and so you end Irish Republican Army um and so you end up with people in the American Civil War up with people in the American Civil War um there's a guy whose surname is Mahar um there's a guy whose surname is Mahar I can't remember his first name mahara I can't remember his first name mahara of the sword is what he was called and of the sword is what he was called and he's a um like an officer in the Union he's a um like an officer in the Union Army and then there are other members of Army and then there are other members of Young Ireland who are Confederate like Young Ireland who are Confederate like virulently pro-slavery Confederate virulently pro-slavery Confederate propagandists um so there is an 1848 propagandists um so there is an 1848 chapter there but in some ways it's kind chapter there but in some ways it's kind of like it shows you can see more of like it shows you can see more clearly what how in the way that the clearly what how in the way that the exper of the Revolutions of 1848 exper of the Revolutions of 1848 inspired Irish intellectuals and inspired Irish intellectuals and politicians more than you can see the politicians more than you can see the the way that the forces at work on the the way that the forces at work on the continent were at work in continent were at work in Ireland would would the famine then Ireland would would the famine then forever be one of the motivational forever be one of the motivational drivers for Irish drivers for Irish Independence that's a good question um Independence that's a good question um and I am one that I am and I am one that I am so it's definitely profoundly symbolic so it's definitely profoundly symbolic and it's certainly very very important and it's certainly very very important for the diaspora um the experience of for the diaspora um the experience of famine the experience I was just back famine the experience I was just back I'm from Montreal I was just back in I'm from Montreal I was just back in Montreal there's a a monument uh Montreal there's a a monument uh underneath uh the Victoria Bridge underneath uh the Victoria Bridge ironically underneath the Victoria ironically underneath the Victoria Bridge um in in in uh to um erected by Bridge um in in in uh to um erected by Irish laborers uh who dug the Leen Canal Irish laborers uh who dug the Leen Canal um you know in in uh in in in Montreal um you know in in uh in in in Montreal uh to 6,000 people who perished on the uh to 6,000 people who perished on the Ships coming over they call them the Ships coming over they call them the coffin ships right so these are steam coffin ships right so these are steam ships where people with typhus uh which ships where people with typhus uh which flourishes a lot of people who died in flourishes a lot of people who died in the famine died of tyus right in some the famine died of tyus right in some ways it was a mass epidemic of typhus ways it was a mass epidemic of typhus which uh afflicts like if you're it's a which uh afflicts like if you're it's a dangerous disease if you're well but it dangerous disease if you're well but it spreads really well in very close kind spreads really well in very close kind of Filth like dirty conditions um as as of Filth like dirty conditions um as as basically digested flea feces like basically digested flea feces like becomes aerosolized you inhale it and becomes aerosolized you inhale it and becomes epidemic typhus so they died of becomes epidemic typhus so they died of typhus on these ships and they were typhus on these ships and they were commemorated there's another Garden in commemorated there's another Garden in Toronto the famine Garden on Aaron K uh Toronto the famine Garden on Aaron K uh which itself right and they they use the which itself right and they they use the the the spelling the traditional like the the spelling the traditional like the Irish spelling uh which is now where the Irish spelling uh which is now where Billy Bishop airport is Right a hero of Billy Bishop airport is Right a hero of the royal Air Force um so there's all the royal Air Force um so there's all these like there's this complex these like there's this complex relationship of Empire and and Colony relationship of Empire and and Colony going on um but people in the diaspora going on um but people in the diaspora certainly saw the famine it was their certainly saw the famine it was their founding trauma right and in some ways founding trauma right and in some ways uh it motivated the support among people uh it motivated the support among people in the diaspora for the what became the in the diaspora for the what became the Revolutionary struggle in Ireland uh but Revolutionary struggle in Ireland uh but whether or not and like for Irish whether or not and like for Irish nationalists and for Irish nationalists and for Irish revolutionaries the hunger strike was revolutionaries the hunger strike was one of the most powerful symbolic one of the most powerful symbolic weapons and I can't help but feel that weapons and I can't help but feel that that has some it's meant in some ways to that has some it's meant in some ways to invoke the experience of the H of of of invoke the experience of the H of of of the famine um although it's also I think the famine um although it's also I think meant in some ways to force the British meant in some ways to force the British to kind of expose the cracks in the to kind of expose the cracks in the ideology of civilization that motivated ideology of civilization that motivated so much of British imperialism in the so much of British imperialism in the 19th century right like you know you 19th century right like you know you have these scenes in the in the in in in have these scenes in the in the in in in the great Irish hunger strikes of the the great Irish hunger strikes of the 20th century of of force feedings right 20th century of of force feedings right uh this kind of really tortur like or uh this kind of really tortur like or torturous experience of VI like violent torturous experience of VI like violent violating experience of force feeding violating experience of force feeding but it's in the name of not allowing but it's in the name of not allowing people to die because the British Empire people to die because the British Empire doesn't allow its subjects to die doesn't allow its subjects to die right or like protects them and there's right or like protects them and there's this weird Dimension there but like the this weird Dimension there but like the proximate causes of the Irish revolution proximate causes of the Irish revolution in 1916 are much like they're set in in 1916 are much like they're set in Motion in part by the famine but like Motion in part by the famine but like the land War of the 1860s and 1870s uh the land War of the 1860s and 1870s uh when the aristocratic landlord class when the aristocratic landlord class where you know there like land is really where you know there like land is really the thing that that underwrites a lot of the thing that that underwrites a lot of Irish revolutionary activity and the Irish revolutionary activity and the famine motivates the diaspora and like famine motivates the diaspora and like makes the diaspora incl line to support makes the diaspora incl line to support the struggle in Britain and the famine the struggle in Britain and the famine is obviously there for Irish is obviously there for Irish revolutionaries but there are a lot more revolutionaries but there are a lot more proximate causes so I mean in some ways proximate causes so I mean in some ways like the and I try to bring this out in like the and I try to bring this out in rot as well like the the history of rot as well like the the history of irishness is is it's is is in some ways irishness is is it's is is in some ways a history of the famine because a lot of a history of the famine because a lot of the stereotypes about irishness that are the stereotypes about irishness that are now kind of like with St Patrick's just now kind of like with St Patrick's just just passed right a lot of the kind of just passed right a lot of the kind of like stereotypes of like like the the like stereotypes of like like the the episode of The Simpsons where it's the episode of The Simpsons where it's the St Patrick's Day parade and like St Patrick's Day parade and like everyone's drunk and fighting and the everyone's drunk and fighting and the certainly drank and fought but so did certainly drank and fought but so did the British in the 19th century and the the British in the 19th century and the stereotype of the Irish at the a of the stereotype of the Irish at the a of the famine was of kind of like um almost famine was of kind of like um almost like a Simeon peasant right like who was like a Simeon peasant right like who was wearing sort of like an old ratty stove wearing sort of like an old ratty stove pipe hat and old evening like just like pipe hat and old evening like just like patched up filthy evening clothes and patched up filthy evening clothes and was kind of like you know lying and was kind of like you know lying and cheating and constantly like work shy cheating and constantly like work shy and that was The Stereotype so The and that was The Stereotype so The Stereotype of like the Irish drunk or Stereotype of like the Irish drunk or like the Irish cop or the Irish like the Irish cop or the Irish firefighter the Irish Ward healer right firefighter the Irish Ward healer right uh or corrupt politician right those are uh or corrupt politician right those are all diasporic inventions and in some all diasporic inventions and in some ways irishness there's two irishes ways irishness there's two irishes irishness is now one that's in Ireland irishness is now one that's in Ireland and that is motivated by Ireland's 20th and that is motivated by Ireland's 20th century history and its relationship to century history and its relationship to the EU and its continuing relationship the EU and its continuing relationship to the United Kingdom and brexit and to the United Kingdom and brexit and then there's another sense of irishness then there's another sense of irishness that in some ways like like they broke that in some ways like like they broke apart the famine broke those two like apart the famine broke those two like the the the famine broke those two the the the famine broke those two Pathways apart and they've diverged um Pathways apart and they've diverged um and every Patrick's Day they meet um and and every Patrick's Day they meet um and one of the reasons why I worked so you one of the reasons why I worked so you know have this like insanely Irish name know have this like insanely Irish name and one of the reasons why I I didn't do and one of the reasons why I I didn't do anything to do with Ireland for a long anything to do with Ireland for a long time in my career is partly out of a time in my career is partly out of a sort of like kind of like discomfort sort of like kind of like discomfort with that with that kind of like you with that with that kind of like you know like long distant irishness right know like long distant irishness right like um like when you know like a like like um like when you know like a like Joe Biden right identifying himself as Joe Biden right identifying himself as Irish and like I'm about as Irish as Joe Irish and like I'm about as Irish as Joe Biden you know what I mean in the sense Biden you know what I mean in the sense that neither of us is really Irish right that neither of us is really Irish right but we our our one side of our family but we our our one side of our family has roots associated with the Potato has roots associated with the Potato Famine has Catholicism right that's Famine has Catholicism right that's still there um some of it you know but still there um some of it you know but like these are this is like a diasporic like these are this is like a diasporic identity and so like one of the things identity and so like one of the things that that was interesting in Rod is that that was interesting in Rod is figuring out where I stood in figuring out where I stood in relationship to that identity relationship to that identity um you also write about the major impact um you also write about the major impact that the femine has on Irish folktales that the femine has on Irish folktales both in Ireland and in the diaspora talk both in Ireland and in the diaspora talk to me about that that's that that's to me about that that's that that's interesting yeah oh I loved that was my interesting yeah oh I loved that was my favorite uh my I think my my favorite favorite uh my I think my my favorite part of the research for the book was part of the research for the book was working with um and and and with a working with um and and and with a research assistant through one of the research assistant through one of the you know I wish I knew Irish properly you know I wish I knew Irish properly and I think if I have a minute I would and I think if I have a minute I would like to like I'll probably never require like to like I'll probably never require the fluency necessary to read these the fluency necessary to read these records in Irish um but I'm sure there's records in Irish um but I'm sure there's a much even richer history that could be a much even richer history that could be written with the the Irish language written with the the Irish language sources from the F the folk collections sources from the F the folk collections uh but in the wake of the of Irish uh but in the wake of the of Irish Independence and when it was still the Independence and when it was still the Irish free state um a government program Irish free state um a government program in the 1930s like not that dissimilar in the 1930s like not that dissimilar actually to some of the works progress actually to some of the works progress administration stuff in the United administration stuff in the United States was the schools collection where States was the schools collection where Irish school children um and our Irish school children um and our professional folklorists were employed professional folklorists were employed in in parallel to collect Irish folk in in parallel to collect Irish folk memories and so it's pretty cute right memories and so it's pretty cute right they they basically across Ireland they they basically across Ireland that's interesting because I always that's interesting because I always think at that time I didn't realize think at that time I didn't realize there was one for for Irish stories there was one for for Irish stories because there was also a similar program because there was also a similar program the New Deal to get the stories of the New Deal to get the stories of formerly enslaved people who were still formerly enslaved people who were still alive yeah I and I I would wonder I alive yeah I and I I would wonder I don't know but I would bet that there's don't know but I would bet that there's a certain kind of like and this is at a a certain kind of like and this is at a time when folklore is emerging as a more time when folklore is emerging as a more kind of solid academic discipline uh but kind of solid academic discipline uh but basically it's pretty cute right the basically it's pretty cute right the idea was they they got Irish school idea was they they got Irish school children to inter old people about all children to inter old people about all kinds of stuff um and so you can see it kinds of stuff um and so you can see it it's completely available online if you it's completely available online if you want to look through it a lot of it's want to look through it a lot of it's been transcribed although even like the been transcribed although even like the handwriting is very legible and quite handwriting is very legible and quite adorable like it's a kids sort of school adorable like it's a kids sort of school cursive um and it's called the the cursive um and it's called the the schools collection um it's searchable if schools collection um it's searchable if you're interested in in looking at it um you're interested in in looking at it um it's got folk folk tales and folk it's got folk folk tales and folk stories and folk memories arranged by stories and folk memories arranged by subject um and one of the things that I subject um and one of the things that I looked into was potato cultivation but looked into was potato cultivation but also the famine um and a lot of the also the famine um and a lot of the people who were reporting these stories people who were reporting these stories were if they were alive during the were if they were alive during the famine were very very young like famine were very very young like children and probably don't remember it children and probably don't remember it um so you're really getting the folk um so you're really getting the folk memory of the famine rather than the memory of the famine rather than the recollection of people who lived through recollection of people who lived through it and in it you can see some of the you it and in it you can see some of the you know like some you can interpret through know like some you can interpret through it some of the like some of it some of the like some of the features of those memories of the the features of those memories of the famine repeat right there's lots of famine repeat right there's lots of stuff of uh about eating as you can stuff of uh about eating as you can imagine eating grass eating money um imagine eating grass eating money um there's lots of kind of Just So Stories there's lots of kind of Just So Stories of like a virtuous woman who you know in of like a virtuous woman who you know in order to keep her to to kind of um make order to keep her to to kind of um make her children who are starving feel her children who are starving feel better boils a pot of rocks but then better boils a pot of rocks but then when she empties the pot of rocks into when she empties the pot of rocks into the basket that they used to drain the the basket that they used to drain the potatoes it's actually brand new potatoes it's actually brand new potatoes and they have a feast um potatoes and they have a feast um there's stories of people who um and there's stories of people who um and this is actually a legend of the famine this is actually a legend of the famine this what's called superism right the this what's called superism right the idea that there were a substantial idea that there were a substantial number of Catholics who in exchange for number of Catholics who in exchange for food converted to protestantism they food converted to protestantism they took the soup um and there certainly took the soup um and there certainly were Protestant missionaries in Ireland were Protestant missionaries in Ireland it's not clear to what extent they were it's not clear to what extent they were offering that kind of cruel of a quid offering that kind of cruel of a quid quid pro quo but in the folk memory and quid pro quo but in the folk memory and I think it pretty unlikely actually like I think it pretty unlikely actually like most most missionaries were most most missionaries were not like what they were doing was not not like what they were doing was not was was in many ways like toxic and was was in many ways like toxic and destructive but they themselves were not destructive but they themselves were not like you don't usually get people who like you don't usually get people who are like like cruel martinets who become are like like cruel martinets who become missionaries to the very poor in Ireland missionaries to the very poor in Ireland right they're they're trying to con right they're they're trying to con convert people to protestantism but it's convert people to protestantism but it's definitely not convert or die um for the definitely not convert or die um for the most part maybe maybe there are some bad most part maybe maybe there are some bad actors but superism in the folk memory actors but superism in the folk memory becomes really widespread and so you becomes really widespread and so you have these stories of a woman one of have these stories of a woman one of them that that that we found in the them that that that we found in the archives um it's like a woman who archives um it's like a woman who converts to protestantism and then as converts to protestantism and then as she dies like a moth flutters and Six she dies like a moth flutters and Six Candles go out in her room and it's this Candles go out in her room and it's this portentous moment so there's this kind portentous moment so there's this kind of I think you can see the the trauma of of I think you can see the the trauma of the famine being digested in these folk the famine being digested in these folk stories but they're not necessarily stories but they're not necessarily reliable guides to the actual events of reliable guides to the actual events of the famine um although sometimes they're the famine um although sometimes they're evocative so one of the things you know evocative so one of the things you know there there are still in Ireland what there there are still in Ireland what these kind of like walk famine walkways these kind of like walk famine walkways which were basically like they still which were basically like they still there they tourist attractions now and there they tourist attractions now and often very remote parts of the country often very remote parts of the country where there's sort of on the side of a where there's sort of on the side of a of a mountain or Hill there's a really of a mountain or Hill there's a really wellmaintained wooden walkway that lets wellmaintained wooden walkway that lets you climb up to the top and some of you climb up to the top and some of those were built as make workor projects those were built as make workor projects in the famine um there also but in in the famine um there also but in famine and a lot of the work that people famine and a lot of the work that people did on Public Works was not productive did on Public Works was not productive like it was it was mostly just to do like it was it was mostly just to do something um but in the folk memory it's something um but in the folk memory it's people dug holes and filled them up people dug holes and filled them up again again again right uh or you have you know misers right uh or you have you know misers there's all these stories of misers like there's all these stories of misers like they're really rich that they're really they're really rich that they're really like they're they're fascinating um like they're they're fascinating um sources and they really give you a sense sources and they really give you a sense of the the the profound rupture of the of the the the profound rupture of the famine and it would be interesting and famine and it would be interesting and it's kind of unfortunate that there it's kind of unfortunate that there wasn't a similar project among members wasn't a similar project among members of the of the of the diaspora uh you know uh to see how those diaspora uh you know uh to see how those so some of like there are some like folk so some of like there are some like folk memories in my own family that I memories in my own family that I integrated into the book like they're integrated into the book like they're again attenuated it's been you know four again attenuated it's been you know four generations since scanland since like my generations since scanland since like my my father's great grandparents my father's great grandparents immigrated to to Canada but there's immigrated to to Canada but there's still this idea that people who spell still this idea that people who spell their name scan scanland with an O their name scan scanland with an O instead of an a to because my name is instead of an a to because my name is spelled with two A's um but if you spell spelled with two A's um but if you spell it with one o scanlin with an O uh those it with one o scanlin with an O uh those are supers and like that o is like the are supers and like that o is like the mark of it's like the mark of can and mark of it's like the mark of can and even if you're back to being Catholic even if you're back to being Catholic the fact you have an o in your name and the fact you have an o in your name and I don't know if any other scandin I don't know if any other scandin believe this if they're listening maybe believe this if they're listening maybe it would be interesting um but in my it would be interesting um but in my family that was like a something that family that was like a something that people said um and so you know there's people said um and so you know there's these kinds of these kinds of there's these kinds of like family legends that build up too like family legends that build up too that give a sense of the the like the that give a sense of the the like the the profound rupture of the famine but the profound rupture of the famine but are not necessarily very useful guides are not necessarily very useful guides to the actual events of the famine yeah to the actual events of the famine yeah like my mom's made a name Bogan we we like my mom's made a name Bogan we we the the story We Tell is that we had to the the story We Tell is that we had to drop the drop the drop the O which I guess is a common thing but we O which I guess is a common thing but we I don't even know if that's really true I don't even know if that's really true or not and no no one in my family or not and no no one in my family probably really knows if that's true or probably really knows if that's true or not um and I mean it's it's it's also not um and I mean it's it's it's also filtered through you know I think a lot filtered through you know I think a lot of people who are like find there's a of people who are like find there's a kind of genealogical stop in Ireland kind of genealogical stop in Ireland right so a lot of people will say if right so a lot of people will say if they're interested in there and one of they're interested in there and one of the things that motivated me to write the things that motivated me to write this book is my my like both my both my this book is my my like both my both my parents died in pretty short order um in parents died in pretty short order um in from 2019 through 2021 um and my brother from 2019 through 2021 um and my brother did a c did a bit of uh sort of did a c did a bit of uh sort of genealogical research genealogical research

the things I found while like one of the things I found while researching the book especially looking researching the book especially looking at cases of eviction which I used court at cases of eviction which I used court records to get at is how like within records to get at is how like within this economy of transactional this economy of transactional contractual relationships of rent paying contractual relationships of rent paying there are lots and lots and lots of much there are lots and lots and lots of much more complex customary and emotional more complex customary and emotional ties so every lease every Farm every ties so every lease every Farm every Cottage is bound up both in a easily Cottage is bound up both in a easily severed is like connected by a pretty severed is like connected by a pretty easily severed legal tie and you sever easily severed legal tie and you sever that tie and everyone gets evicted but that tie and everyone gets evicted but at the same time those evictions and the at the same time those evictions and the proceedings surrounding them reveal just proceedings surrounding them reveal just How Deeply everything else is connected How Deeply everything else is connected and so people remember right and that's and so people remember right and that's one of the things that makes superism one of the things that makes superism into
