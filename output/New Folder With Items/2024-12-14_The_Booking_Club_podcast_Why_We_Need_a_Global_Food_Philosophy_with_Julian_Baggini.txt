----------------------------------------
How we live is shaped by how we eat.

You can see this in the vastly different approaches to growing, preparing and eating food around the world, such as the hunter-gatherer Hadza in Tanzania whose sustainable lifestyle is under threat in a crowded planet, or Western societies whose food is farmed or bred in vast intensive enterprises.

And most of us now rely on a complex global food web of production, distribution, consumption and disposal, which is now contending with unprecedented challenges. The need for a better understanding of how we feed ourselves has never been more urgent.

In this wide-ranging and definitive book, philosopher Julian Baggini expertly delves into the best and worst food practises in a huge array of different societies, past and present.

His exploration takes him from cutting-edge technologies, such as new farming methods, cultured meat, GM and astronaut food, to the ethics and health of ultra processed food and aquaculture, as he takes a forensic look at the

World eats a global food philosophy well welcome aboard the Good philosophy well welcome aboard the Good Ship box e we got sails blowing there's Ship box e we got sails blowing there's wind coming in from all directions you wind coming in from all directions you can start to hear it now as the windows can start to hear it now as the windows building up yeah there's a storm building up yeah there's a storm Sweeping in from the West I think storm Sweeping in from the West I think storm BT nonetheless we've powered on and BT nonetheless we've powered on and powered through to get to where we are powered through to get to where we are today we're sat here at box e as I today we're sat here at box e as I mentioned a little restaurant part of a mentioned a little restaurant part of a number of restaurants in shipping number of restaurants in shipping containers in Bristol near whopping Warf containers in Bristol near whopping Warf my guest who's been on the show before my guest who's been on the show before you may remember the philosopher Julian you may remember the philosopher Julian bini talking about his latest book How bini talking about his latest book How The World eats I don't know if that sets The World eats I don't know if that sets the scene well enough but uh perhaps you the scene well enough but uh perhaps you can tell tell us more about this place can tell tell us more about this place Julian well I mean yeah and you can hear Julian well I mean yeah and you can hear that the as soon as you started press that the as soon as you started press record the wind and rain has gone out we record the wind and rain has gone out we are undercover Outdoors which um is an are undercover Outdoors which um is an interesting choice in itself no it's a interesting choice in itself no it's a lovely lovely Place boxy um it's run by lovely lovely Place boxy um it's run by a couple Tessa and Elliot and Elliot is a couple Tessa and Elliot and Elliot is the only person in the kitchen that's the only person in the kitchen that's the the joy of it it's just him and they the the joy of it it's just him and they just cook delicious food it's really just cook delicious food it's really there's this old story St you may have there's this old story St you may have heard it is some kind of I don't know heard it is some kind of I don't know who says it probably it's Japanese story who says it probably it's Japanese story a Chinese chef says that in China he's a Chinese chef says that in China he's we can do anything we can make a carrot we can do anything we can make a carrot taste like a pig or something like this taste like a pig or something like this and the Japanese Chef returns and he and the Japanese Chef returns and he says oh well okay in in I'm our great says oh well okay in in I'm our great chefs can make a tarrot carrot taste chefs can make a tarrot carrot taste more like a carrot than any other carrot more like a carrot than any other carrot and it's this idea these two sort and it's this idea these two sort different ideas of Cuisine you know is different ideas of Cuisine you know is it about sort of making things taste of it about sort of making things taste of all like other things or just bringing all like other things or just bringing out the best and this is the kind of out the best and this is the kind of place they bring out the best here comes place they bring out the best here comes a glass of what did you order again a glass of what did you order again Julian What's this called it's um well Julian What's this called it's um well Aliano is is Italian wine but this is Aliano is is Italian wine but this is alian cor or something which means like alian cor or something which means like a big Alano and it's um the wine they've a big Alano and it's um the wine they've had on their list for ages and it is had on their list for ages and it is always nice and um so even though it's always nice and um so even though it's lunchtime and I shouldn't be drinking I lunchtime and I shouldn't be drinking I can't resist just one glass of this I've can't resist just one glass of this I've managed to resist but um I would also managed to resist but um I would also say for the record you may not know this say for the record you may not know this I think you probably know or have I think you probably know or have expressed more knowledge about wine than expressed more knowledge about wine than probably any other guest the last time probably any other guest the last time we sat down together it was at a place we sat down together it was at a place called bravas also in Bristol uh not in called bravas also in Bristol uh not in the same vicinity but there we had some the same vicinity but there we had some delicious Spanish treats along with some delicious Spanish treats along with some lovely white wine that was of course in lovely white wine that was of course in summer um but tell us a little bit about summer um but tell us a little bit about the way that people approach Cuisine the way that people approach Cuisine from different parts of the world from different parts of the world differently relates to to this you say differently relates to to this you say it's about bringing out the best of the it's about bringing out the best of the ingredients is that from a particular ingredients is that from a particular tradition or geography or is that just tradition or geography or is that just the way they do things here out of the way they do things here out of sensibility I I think probably to be sensibility I I think probably to be fair every um Cuisine would suggest it's fair every um Cuisine would suggest it's bringing out the best in the bringing out the best in the ingredients ingredients ingredients uh I think you know if you compare like uh I think you know if you compare like say French and Italian food and Italian say French and Italian food is very self-consciously about food is very self-consciously about Simplicity of ingredients so again you Simplicity of ingredients so again you put two or three things together and put two or three things together and it's not trying to make anything other it's not trying to make anything other than what it is the French would say the than what it is the French would say the way they bring out the best know way they bring out the best know ingredients is to combine them to make ingredients is to combine them to make these sources and everything which are these sources and everything which are kind of flavors which aren't just sort kind of flavors which aren't just sort of like not just bringing out the flavor of like not just bringing out the flavor of the individual ingredient it's it's of the individual ingredient it's it's the combining and the spices and the the combining and the spices and the herbs your name bini is that that's herbs your name bini is that that's Italian it's Italian my father was Italian it's Italian my father was Italian yeah and were you brought up Italian yeah and were you brought up with cooking as a sacred thing in the with cooking as a sacred thing in the household well it's interesting my household well it's interesting my mother was English I grew up in England mother was English I grew up in England so um she had taken on a few influences so um she had taken on a few influences from Italy having stayed a little bit from Italy having stayed a little bit there but not a lot I think the the way there but not a lot I think the the way in which I absorbed the food culture was in which I absorbed the food culture was was when we used to visit the Italian was when we used to visit the Italian family we used to go to family we used to go to Easter and you know the food was just Easter and you know the food was just always such a highlight at Easter the always such a highlight at Easter the non would always make the ravioli and it non would always make the ravioli and it was like a two or three day process you was like a two or three day process you they she she handmade the the the pasta they she she handmade the the the pasta it was rolled out all all all flat it was rolled out all all all flat surfaces were covered with it you know surfaces were covered with it you know the meat put in and you know I'd have the meat put in and you know I'd have seconds and thirds of that but also just seconds and thirds of that but also just everything we ate there we really liked everything we ate there we really liked and of course they have this sort of and of course they have this sort of what a Joy about food it was simple food what a Joy about food it was simple food in lots of ways the ravioli was in lots of ways the ravioli was elaborate but most food was quite simple elaborate but most food was quite simple and if if I us to list the things we and if if I us to list the things we used to eat there it was always the same used to eat there it was always the same stuff it wasn't widely stuff it wasn't widely varied but I think we really sort of got varied but I think we really sort of got from that that sense that food can be from that that sense that food can be just a simple joyous lovely thing and just a simple joyous lovely thing and although in England we didn't always although in England we didn't always well we didn't really get that at all I well we didn't really get that at all I think it left a mark it's going to be think it left a mark it's going to be food from beginning to end on this food from beginning to end on this episode because as mentioned your latest episode because as mentioned your latest book deals with how to put it in a book deals with how to put it in a sentence I would say the global systemic sentence I would say the global systemic failure of food supply chains practices failure of food supply chains practices and ethics and how we can write those and ethics and how we can write those wrongs we all know in the various ways wrongs we all know in the various ways in which this is true in our everyday in which this is true in our everyday lives we sense it we sense waste we lives we sense it we sense waste we sense malpractice we sense exorbitant sense malpractice we sense exorbitant abundance on the one hand and criminal abundance on the one hand and criminal deficits on the other but this is an deficits on the other but this is an Ever revolving story it isn't just how I Ever revolving story it isn't just how I was led to believe the food system was led to believe the food system worked when I grew up where we had worked when I grew up where we had enough and others didn't there's all enough and others didn't there's all sorts of things to delve into and I feel sorts of things to delve into and I feel like I'm taking up more time in like I'm taking up more time in explaining all this than than the author explaining all this than than the author let me hand back to you um the the let me hand back to you um the the premise of how the world eats a global premise of how the world eats a global food philosophy as you call it yeah well food philosophy as you call it yeah well it's interesting where you put it it's interesting where you put it because I think you you you framed it because I think you you you framed it around really highlighting out the around really highlighting out the failures the systemic failures I think failures the systemic failures I think that's true but it's also looking about that's true but it's also looking about what works I mean Food Systems is so what works I mean Food Systems is so I've got really interested in and it I've got really interested in and it just is all so complicated pretty much just is all so complicated pretty much everything that you know you think you everything that you know you think you know about food it turns out that it's know about food it turns out that it's more complicated than you thought yeah I more complicated than you thought yeah I mean just to butt in a little bit there mean just to butt in a little bit there I think you're right I think this book I think you're right I think this book is a lot to do with what works but the is a lot to do with what works but the idea of a book that just outlines what idea of a book that just outlines what works almost almost doesn't need to be works almost almost doesn't need to be written does it but does it well it does written does it but does it well it does in a way because I think the thing in a way because I think the thing is by the time I get to my conclusions is by the time I get to my conclusions how should the food system be I'm not how should the food system be I'm not trying to we had this interesting trying to we had this interesting discussion with my publisher my discussion with my publisher my publisher they you know created some publisher they you know created some blur for the back jacket or the catalog blur for the back jacket or the catalog or something and they said something or something and they said something like bini presents his new food like bini presents his new food philosophy and I said I don't want that philosophy and I said I don't want that wording because the whole point is it's wording because the whole point is it's not my food philosophy I'm really not my food philosophy I'm really genuinely trying to just spot the genuinely trying to just spot the principles that have principles that have worked all across the world in in worked all across the world in in history um so anyway so the so the history um so anyway so the so the principles that came out were actually principles that came out were actually you know things which I think everyone you know things which I think everyone should probably have little problem should probably have little problem agreeing with they almost seem obvious agreeing with they almost seem obvious and you think oh oh dear I've gone all and you think oh oh dear I've gone all this way to show things are obvious but this way to show things are obvious but then actually that's the whole strength then actually that's the whole strength it's obvious the kind of principles that it's obvious the kind of principles that should be governing a food system and should be governing a food system and it's really obvious they're not it's really obvious they're not governing the one we got so I think governing the one we got so I think that's the kind of strength so yeah you that's the kind of strength so yeah you have to point out that what doesn't work have to point out that what doesn't work but pointing out what works and the but pointing out what works and the other things I think she's really quite other things I think she's really quite important is one of the principles is important is one of the principles is plurality and I think that's that's the plurality and I think that's that's the first one I I list at the end because first one I I list at the end because when people are asking what works so when people are asking what works so often the Assumption there is we have to often the Assumption there is we have to find the way with capital T and capital find the way with capital T and capital W and I think one thing we learned from W and I think one thing we learned from the fact that there are different the fact that there are different ecosystems there are different cultures ecosystems there are different cultures different climates different populations different climates different populations different economies and what works does different economies and what works does vary a lot Depending on time and place vary a lot Depending on time and place so we got to get away from this idea so we got to get away from this idea that there is the way to farm the way to that there is the way to farm the way to eat the way to arrange a food economy eat the way to arrange a food economy give us two examples then one example on give us two examples then one example on the one hand about how the obvious ways the one hand about how the obvious ways in which food systems work or should in which food systems work or should work don't work in reality um and then work don't work in reality um and then another example of how food practices another example of how food practices vary which you think go under recognized vary which you think go under recognized let's take an example of something that let's take an example of something that works very very old thing that works so works very very old thing that works so if we go back to well fish farming is if we go back to well fish farming is something that people think of as some something that people think of as some new thing and it's new it is new in the new thing and it's new it is new in the sense that it has come to dominate in a sense that it has come to dominate in a way it never did in about 1960 about 2% way it never did in about 1960 about 2% of the world's fish and seafood was of the world's fish and seafood was farmed and now it's more than half but farmed and now it's more than half but the practice itself goes back to ancient the practice itself goes back to ancient China and the way they did it was China and the way they did it was brilliant and they still do it this way brilliant and they still do it this way in lots of places carp in Patty Fields in lots of places carp in Patty Fields right now in technical details are right now in technical details are things I I don't have in my fingertips I things I I don't have in my fingertips I write them down so that I can remember write them down so that I can remember them as well but essentially it creates them as well but essentially it creates this wonderfully symbiotic system where this wonderfully symbiotic system where the plants and the fish are providing the plants and the fish are providing nutrients for each other they're also nutrients for each other they're also keeping the water clean and you you know keeping the water clean and you you know you have to add less as a farmer you you have to add less as a farmer you have to feed the car they're feeding on have to feed the car they're feeding on on bits and pieces from from the rice on bits and pieces from from the rice pades this is a a system which works pades this is a a system which works brilliantly it's sustainable it's brilliantly it's sustainable it's circular you know uh the the fish and circular you know uh the the fish and the rice are in this sort of like the rice are in this sort of like symbiotic relationship and it's been a symbiotic relationship and it's been a system that's lasted for a couple of system that's lasted for a couple of thousand years thousand years thousand years is and the point about that is that it's is and the point about that is that it's not just a quaint old system if you look not just a quaint old system if you look at the principles behind it you can at the principles behind it you can replicate those in in different contexts replicate those in in different contexts so there's uh I think there's seab bream so there's uh I think there's seab bream and shrimp is is a way a combination and shrimp is is a way a combination farming they're trying in places I think farming they're trying in places I think in the Mediterranean similar kind of in the Mediterranean similar kind of system you have the two different kinds system you have the two different kinds of sea life together in the same system of sea life together in the same system and they work well whereas in contrast and they work well whereas in contrast the way in which we Farm a lot of salmon the way in which we Farm a lot of salmon for example is is awful it's far too for example is is awful it's far too intensive we get problems with sea life intensive we get problems with sea life there's uh it's polluting uh the sea there's uh it's polluting uh the sea life infect wild stocks it's pretty damn life infect wild stocks it's pretty damn Dreadful and that's it doesn't respect Dreadful and that's it doesn't respect those principles of you know uh those principles of you know uh circularity and sustainability so that circularity and sustainability so that yeah that's that's the example of yeah that's that's the example of something really works and we can really something really works and we can really learn from it you also want an example learn from it you also want an example of plurality plurality yeah yeah okay of plurality plurality yeah yeah okay well the clearest example is around diet well the clearest example is around diet you know what's the optimal diet and you know what's the optimal diet and there many people trying to sell you a there many people trying to sell you a book which will tell you what optimal book which will tell you what optimal diet is and perhaps many people think diet is and perhaps many people think the optimal diet is the Mediterranean the optimal diet is the Mediterranean diet but I mean let's just go not too diet but I mean let's just go not too far away let's look at um Japan uh far away let's look at um Japan uh Japan's diet isn't the Mediterranean Japan's diet isn't the Mediterranean diet they have a lot of white rice diet they have a lot of white rice actually they're increasingly a lot of actually they're increasingly a lot of bread as well um which which which a lot bread as well um which which which a lot of people think is bad all these carbs of people think is bad all these carbs they have a heck of a lot more fish than they have a heck of a lot more fish than mediterranian diet um but let's go more mediterranian diet um but let's go more extreme let's look at the massai the extreme let's look at the massai the Massi traditional diet is based around Massi traditional diet is based around milk blood and meat mostly milk some milk blood and meat mostly milk some blood and some meat very few plants blood and some meat very few plants which they consider to be dirty which they consider to be dirty literally soiled from the ground or literally soiled from the ground or let's look at the Inuit I know there let's look at the Inuit I know there other Polar Polar people traditional other Polar Polar people traditional polar societies they're eating a lot of polar societies they're eating a lot of basically seal blubber and fat really basically seal blubber and fat really large quantities of fat compared to large quantities of fat compared to what's considered healthy very little what's considered healthy very little vegetable matter again now if there were vegetable matter again now if there were one diet which worked for everybody one diet which worked for everybody these people would be dead in fact contr these people would be dead in fact contr um they've lived very healthily for many um they've lived very healthily for many years and when they undergo What's years and when they undergo What's called the nutrition transition towards called the nutrition transition towards more Western diets their health outcomes more Western diets their health outcomes go down that's a well studied go down that's a well studied phenomenon why is that well in fact phenomenon why is that well in fact there are reasons there underneath that there are reasons there underneath that plurality there are some differences in plurality there are some differences in genetics different populations evolve uh genetics different populations evolve uh the most obvious one people aware of is the most obvious one people aware of is is lactose ability to digest is lactose ability to digest lactose but there are other things that lactose but there are other things that happen as well but also it's because all happen as well but also it's because all both in both these societies they're both in both these societies they're eating Whole Foods proper foods and eating Whole Foods proper foods and where people eat Whole Foods they tend where people eat Whole Foods they tend to have no problem getting all their to have no problem getting all their nutrients so the mystery of how the nutrients so the mystery of how the Inuit get their vitamin C well it's Inuit get their vitamin C well it's there in the entrails and the innards a there in the entrails and the innards a lot of the sea life they eat and in the lot of the sea life they eat and in the the small amounts of plants that they the small amounts of plants that they eat so yeah um there's a general eat so yeah um there's a general principle about eating whole proper principle about eating whole proper foods but which foods uh can vary foods but which foods uh can vary enormously you mentioned the Massi there enormously you mentioned the Massi there milk blood and meat uh could you explain milk blood and meat uh could you explain perhaps where the The Blood Part plays a perhaps where the The Blood Part plays a role is this drinkable or is it I I role is this drinkable or is it I I think I think they they I think they think I think they they I think they well I believe they do just drink it well I believe they do just drink it actually I mean they basically draw it actually I mean they basically draw it from so they keep cattle and another from so they keep cattle and another interesting thing about this Society interesting thing about this Society like a lot of traditional societies they like a lot of traditional societies they Revere the animals that they were Revere the animals that they were ultimately going to slaughter and eat ultimately going to slaughter and eat and of course they don't kill them for and of course they don't kill them for their meat very often because they they their meat very often because they they rely on them for their milk they drink rely on them for their milk they drink about four is it four pints a day on about four is it four pints a day on typically um but yeah the blood they typically um but yeah the blood they basically draw blood you know um in the basically draw blood you know um in the same way that someone might you might go same way that someone might you might go and give blood anyone any sort of mammal and give blood anyone any sort of mammal can can supply a certain amount of blood can can supply a certain amount of blood and be fine they just take relatively and be fine they just take relatively small amounts from the cattle at a small amounts from the cattle at a regular basis and they they eat that regular basis and they they eat that that's fascinating I mean it sounds like that's fascinating I mean it sounds like a hokey influenza diet doesn't it milk a hokey influenza diet doesn't it milk blood and meat well again but again they blood and meat well again but again they say hokey influence the diet that's a say hokey influence the diet that's a good point I mean a lot of the people good point I mean a lot of the people who are claiming we should have these who are claiming we should have these paleo diets and maybe we'll talk about paleo diets and maybe we'll talk about that later what they don't appreciate is that later what they don't appreciate is that the kind of meat and the kind of that the kind of meat and the kind of plants that are eaten by hunter plants that are eaten by hunter gatherers are totally different to the gatherers are totally different to the kind of industrial thing we have now so kind of industrial thing we have now so if you are going to go to a diet which if you are going to go to a diet which is very heavily reliant on meat it's is very heavily reliant on meat it's actually not very good to just eat those actually not very good to just eat those lean steaks and those um Factory farmed lean steaks and those um Factory farmed chicken breasts you know it's got to be chicken breasts you know it's got to be about eating all the different bits of about eating all the different bits of the animal and the fatty bits too yeah the animal and the fatty bits too yeah yeah absolutely and we we don't I mean yeah absolutely and we we don't I mean you know you mentioned these more you know you mentioned these more traditional forms of eating that come traditional forms of eating that come out of traditional cultures rever the out of traditional cultures rever the animals that they consume I think I animals that they consume I think I probably mentioned this on previous probably mentioned this on previous episodes in conversation on and off mic episodes in conversation on and off mic but um there's so much of of an animal but um there's so much of of an animal we used to eat that we just don't we used to eat that we just don't anymore I'm thinking particularly of anymore I'm thinking particularly of liver which is in my opinion delicious liver which is in my opinion delicious but so many people find themselves but so many people find themselves feeling queasy just thinking about it feeling queasy just thinking about it some people feel koozy just thinking some people feel koozy just thinking about blood they always order a steak about blood they always order a steak well done it's odd isn't it how much well done it's odd isn't it how much meat we consume meat we consume but how much meat we find difficult to but how much meat we find difficult to stomach when we really think about what stomach when we really think about what it is well I think that many people have it is well I think that many people have have observed this it's an obvious point have observed this it's an obvious point there is this now huge there is this now huge disconnect uh meat has become this disconnect uh meat has become this highly sanitized product which most highly sanitized product which most people are buying from you know shrunk people are buying from you know shrunk wrapped whatever it might be um if you wrapped whatever it might be um if you if you've been buy from a butcher if you've been buy from a butcher butchers these days don't tend to kind butchers these days don't tend to kind of display so many of the sort of like of display so many of the sort of like backstory stuff they have the cuts um backstory stuff they have the cuts um laid out and people don't like to think laid out and people don't like to think of it as being an animal that was once of it as being an animal that was once alive if you bring that up in alive if you bring that up in conversation it's considered uh conversation it's considered uh distasteful I think traditional distasteful I think traditional societies we shouldn't Ro we should societies we shouldn't Ro we should never romanticize traditional societies never romanticize traditional societies I talk a lot about traditional Societies I talk a lot about traditional Societies in the book I talk a lot about what we in the book I talk a lot about what we can learn from them but I I I really can learn from them but I I I really think we shouldn't romanticize them some think we shouldn't romanticize them some of their practices around ritual of their practices around ritual Slaughter and everything knowing what we Slaughter and everything knowing what we now know about animal ients and their now know about animal ients and their nervous systems I think we consider them nervous systems I think we consider them to be uh distressing for the animal and to be uh distressing for the animal and we shouldn't do it but what they get we shouldn't do it but what they get absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right is they are just closer to the reality is they are just closer to the reality of the fact that of the fact that nature the world is one in which the nature the world is one in which the animals killing and eating other animals animals killing and eating other animals and death and birth these these are just and death and birth these these are just inherently part of it you can't escape inherently part of it you can't escape from that what you can try to do is to from that what you can try to do is to be an actor in that system who acts with be an actor in that system who acts with more compassion you don't create more compassion you don't create needless suffering but I think you know needless suffering but I think you know because we become so because we become so disconnected we have this idea that you disconnected we have this idea that you to respect nature is to to respect nature is to somehow not have anything to do with the somehow not have anything to do with the unpleasant side of it and I I think it's unpleasant side of it and I I think it's unsustainable I mean unsustainable is a unsustainable I mean unsustainable is a bit wrong maybe I respect people who bit wrong maybe I respect people who choose to be vegan I do respect that choose to be vegan I do respect that because they are making an effort to because they are making an effort to reduce animal suffering they are reduce animal suffering they are reducing animal suffering and they're reducing animal suffering and they're making an effort which the vast majority making an effort which the vast majority of people just simply do not of people just simply do not make but I think that you know the idea make but I think that you know the idea that it is the purist position I don't that it is the purist position I don't think that's true um I would I would think that's true um I would I would agree with you on that I want to know agree with you on that I want to know why you say that yeah if you and I are why you say that yeah if you and I are thinking along the same lines anything thinking along the same lines anything approaching Purity is about fully approaching Purity is about fully engaging and I think cutting out vast engaging and I think cutting out vast SES of what there is to eat isn't fully SES of what there is to eat isn't fully engaging and I think that actually that engaging and I think that actually that is more of an unhealthy disconnect from is more of an unhealthy disconnect from nature than simply preserving it but nature than simply preserving it but leaving it completely alone and having leaving it completely alone and having nothing to do with it well this might nothing to do with it well this might sound like a taunt I don't mean it to be sound like a taunt I don't mean it to be but let's say let's say you love cats a but let's say let's say you love cats a lot of people say they love cats um cats lot of people say they love cats um cats are killers they are carnivores by are killers they are carnivores by Nature they they just nibble on a few Nature they they just nibble on a few plants they they most of their diet is plants they they most of their diet is from meat they will kill and they'll from meat they will kill and they'll kill horribly without any care or kill horribly without any care or compassion whatever it might be do if compassion whatever it might be do if you love your cat but you but you want you love your cat but you but you want it to be vegan you're not really loving it to be vegan you're not really loving your cat as it is you're loving bits of your cat as it is you're loving bits of your cat and you're wanting other bits your cat and you're wanting other bits of the cat not not to be like that um of the cat not not to be like that um now of course we I'm not saying we now of course we I'm not saying we should act as a cat does we we have the should act as a cat does we we have the capacity to stand back and be more capacity to stand back and be more considerate and we should do that but considerate and we should do that but you know um there is there can be no you know um there is there can be no nature without the death death and nature without the death death and killing without the Predators without killing without the Predators without the carnivores without the omnivores the carnivores without the omnivores there wouldn't be a balance in nature so there wouldn't be a balance in nature so I think the the most sort of like fully I think the the most sort of like fully human position to be in is one in which human position to be in is one in which we take on the responsibilities we have we take on the responsibilities we have been given by our increased awareness been given by our increased awareness and knowledge and understanding to treat and knowledge and understanding to treat the animals much better than we the animals much better than we otherwise do but to to separate otherwise do but to to separate ourselves from that world of death and ourselves from that world of death and killing I think is to try and remove us killing I think is to try and remove us from something which is Central to the from something which is Central to the The Human Condition really we we've The Human Condition really we we've spoken about what's I might consider the spoken about what's I might consider the obvious the ethic around how we treat obvious the ethic around how we treat animals and no doubt we'll come back to animals and no doubt we'll come back to that but this isn't the first book that but this isn't the first book you've written about food hello hello you've written about food hello hello how you getting on good well with order how you getting on good well with order with order yeah okay well listen Julian with order yeah okay well listen Julian far away go for the CH hisy cabbage far away go for the CH hisy cabbage because that is a bit of a because that is a bit of a signature thing here with a new Twist of signature thing here with a new Twist of trout and I think I'll have to go for trout and I think I'll have to go for the rest of duck and I'm going to go the rest of duck and I'm going to go please for uh the same starter I think please for uh the same starter I think the same main as well to be honest thank the same main as well to be honest thank you to be honest you know this book you to be honest you know this book obviously you can see the echo of the obviously you can see the echo of the title with how the world thinks which is title with how the world thinks which is about global about global about global philosophy and I I I like to think this philosophy and I I I like to think this isn't just a kind of like I me people isn't just a kind of like I me people people might think it's it's just a people might think it's it's just a cheap attempt to get a book out with a cheap attempt to get a book out with a similar title it really isn't but what similar title it really isn't but what this the same kind of motivation was in this the same kind of motivation was in both cases there was a subject which I both cases there was a subject which I was curious about wanted to know more was curious about wanted to know more about and I felt there wasn't a book out about and I felt there wasn't a book out there already which sort of did it there already which sort of did it pretty thoroughly accessibly and read pretty thoroughly accessibly and read and I thought the food system is so and I thought the food system is so important actually it's really important important actually it's really important it's really complex I can pick up a book it's really complex I can pick up a book which would tell me about how things which would tell me about how things works and and and and dived into them works and and and and dived into them and of course it's also such a broad and of course it's also such a broad thing one reason why there's no such thing one reason why there's no such bookies that no one's an expert on bookies that no one's an expert on everything so you have to approach this everything so you have to approach this my term is like philosophical journalism my term is like philosophical journalism the journalist aspect of it is that I the journalist aspect of it is that I have to kind of find the key experts in have to kind of find the key experts in each area I have to find the most each area I have to find the most definitive documents and books I have to definitive documents and books I have to kind of put those things together and kind of put those things together and tell a story but the philosophical bit tell a story but the philosophical bit is the drawing out the general is the drawing out the general principles that that's how the principles that that's how the philosophy comes into it so yeah so philosophy comes into it so yeah so that's what I I I really wanted to do that's what I I I really wanted to do and and partly is born of a almost a and and partly is born of a almost a frustration that I think because we frustration that I think because we don't understand it so well people are don't understand it so well people are very drawn towards somewhat simplistic very drawn towards somewhat simplistic um you know simplistic understandings um you know simplistic understandings about the way things should be and very about the way things should be and very crudely I think people think there's crudely I think people think there's this horrible thing we call the this horrible thing we call the industrial food system and there's this industrial food system and there's this beautiful thing we call Organics beautiful thing we call Organics regenerative and all that kind of stuff regenerative and all that kind of stuff and basically let's get rid of the and basically let's get rid of the industrial stuff get in the organic industrial stuff get in the organic stuff end of story simple as that I mean stuff end of story simple as that I mean that's the production side of things and that's the production side of things and you know I I well I mean I wasn't sure you know I I well I mean I wasn't sure when I started but I was pretty sure when I started but I was pretty sure that was simplistic and sure enough it that was simplistic and sure enough it is you is you is you know which philosopher of all the know which philosopher of all the reading that you've done not just for reading that you've done not just for this book but over the course of your this book but over the course of your career have you found interestingly the career have you found interestingly the most preoccupied with food you've most preoccupied with food you've written a book about David Hume and written a book about David Hume and David Hume was if nothing else a man of David Hume was if nothing else a man of exuberant Pleasures he was he was he was exuberant Pleasures he was he was he was a trencherman as we would say in a trencherman as we would say in oldfashioned speak I I I have to say not oldfashioned speak I I I have to say not really I mean I think you know food has really I mean I think you know food has been very much sort of been very much sort of neglected in in Western Philosophy for neglected in in Western Philosophy for sure sure sure um In classical Indian philosophy food um In classical Indian philosophy food has a has a more of an important role um has a has a more of an important role um and that's partly because there's this and that's partly because there's this understanding that physical practices understanding that physical practices are important for what they would call are important for what they would call spiritual but also intellectual kind of spiritual but also intellectual kind of development and so there wasn't that development and so there wasn't that kind of disregard for the body I me if kind of disregard for the body I me if you think about yoga for example you you think about yoga for example you know yoga is one of the classical know yoga is one of the classical schools of Indian philosophy I mean schools of Indian philosophy I mean that's just taking to a clearer extreme that's just taking to a clearer extreme if you like and more more general idea if you like and more more general idea that yes you know how you sit how you that yes you know how you sit how you breathe all these things are important breathe all these things are important and food would be part of that so they and food would be part of that so they had theories of food but other than that had theories of food but other than that certainly in the western tradition it's certainly in the western tradition it's been neglected because I think ever ever been neglected because I think ever ever since Plato really and even Aristotle since Plato really and even Aristotle there's been this idea that our highest there's been this idea that our highest nature is nature is nature is intellectual and that anything else intellectual and that anything else isn't really significant in Plato's case isn't really significant in Plato's case the body wasn't really important at all the body wasn't really important at all Aristotle who's a philosopher I hugely Aristotle who's a philosopher I hugely influenced by and take a lot from he had influenced by and take a lot from he had a more realistic view of a human being a more realistic view of a human being as a as a biological animal but as a as a biological animal but nonetheless for him it was the nonetheless for him it was the intellectual part that really mattered intellectual part that really mattered and and nothing to do with the body so and and nothing to do with the body so you know you you you struggle so I can I you know you you you struggle so I can I can take certain ideas and principles can take certain ideas and principles and arguments and apply them to food but and arguments and apply them to food but I don't get direct inspiration you know I don't get direct inspiration you know it's not like I can quote you what Hume it's not like I can quote you what Hume said about food he mainly said what Hume said about food he mainly said in in letters not in his yes that's said in in letters not in his yes that's right not in his words now that I think right not in his words now that I think about it I do recall reading a p from about it I do recall reading a p from saara where he's talking about how saara where he's talking about how non-being accentuates being he talks non-being accentuates being he talks about the Blind Man's taste for a cigar about the Blind Man's taste for a cigar is made all the more intense by the fact is made all the more intense by the fact that he can't see one sense withdrawn that he can't see one sense withdrawn amplifies all other senses probably amplifies all other senses probably that's where it ends for me too so if that's where it ends for me too so if you don't mind us getting uh personal to you don't mind us getting uh personal to the extent that I'm going to ask you the extent that I'm going to ask you about how all of this research and about how all of this research and everything that you've explored and has everything that you've explored and has gone into the book has formed your own gone into the book has formed your own personal philosophy about food your own personal philosophy about food your own personal regimen your own diet all right personal regimen your own diet all right could you take us through that how has could you take us through that how has it changed you writing this book you it changed you writing this book you can't write a book like this and have it can't write a book like this and have it not change the way that you eat and not change the way that you eat and think about food one okay so let me just think about food one okay so let me just list a couple of of of small list a couple of of of small changes one is that actually I think I changes one is that actually I think I have become less a little bit less have become less a little bit less concerned with my individual personal concerned with my individual personal food choices so you know like a lot of food choices so you know like a lot of people who think about food I was very people who think about food I was very keen to you know buy things in the right keen to you know buy things in the right places you know all these good things places you know all these good things like local and seasonal when necessary like local and seasonal when necessary and when possible although never and when possible although never dogmatically CU that was always very dogmatically CU that was always very simplistic um simplistic um simplistic um actually one thing that has sort of actually one thing that has sort of shifted in my thinking is this shifted in my thinking is this recognition that because these issues recognition that because these issues because the problems are so systemic because the problems are so systemic there's a kind of narcissism or almost there's a kind of narcissism or almost huus about thinking that what really huus about thinking that what really matters is each individual thing that matters is each individual thing that you buy as a responsible citizen as an e you buy as a responsible citizen as an e as an ethical person it makes good sense as an ethical person it makes good sense to try to make the right choices when to try to make the right choices when you can but I think we can become kind you can but I think we can become kind of obsessive about that so you know I I of obsessive about that so you know I I think I'm a little less obsessive about think I'm a little less obsessive about that I'm not saying just slackened my that I'm not saying just slackened my principles but I recognize that change principles but I recognize that change is going to come basically by groups is going to come basically by groups campaigning and lobbying not by campaigning and lobbying not by individuals changing what they put in individuals changing what they put in their shopping their shopping their shopping basket there been a few other little basket there been a few other little little ch changes um some of them are little ch changes um some of them are almost kind of what can I say I mean almost kind of what can I say I mean some of them quite small I mean for some of them quite small I mean for example at any given moment there's example at any given moment there's always some kind of thing in the air in always some kind of thing in the air in the in the atmosphere about food and the in the atmosphere about food and diet and at the moment we've got for diet and at the moment we've got for examp I think two of the big things examp I think two of the big things around at the moment are the gut around at the moment are the gut microbiome and blood sugar levels you microbiome and blood sugar levels you know these are the two things that most know these are the two things that most people are obsessed by now and if people are obsessed by now and if they're if they're trying to eat they're if they're trying to eat healthily they're trying to sort of help healthily they're trying to sort of help with those two things and I did look at with those two things and I did look at some things for that actually I I I some things for that actually I I I looked about it even more for an article looked about it even more for an article which came out between finishing the which came out between finishing the book and the book coming out and again I book and the book coming out and again I just become a lot more kind of I think just become a lot more kind of I think skeptical of the stronger claims made skeptical of the stronger claims made for both so headlines for you gut for both so headlines for you gut microbiome absolutely it's very very microbiome absolutely it's very very important do we know what a good one important do we know what a good one looks like not really can we do much to looks like not really can we do much to control it yes eat lots of variety of control it yes eat lots of variety of foods mainly fibrous the idea that you foods mainly fibrous the idea that you should be sort of scoffing kimchi and should be sort of scoffing kimchi and kefir they're perfectly healthy nice kefir they're perfectly healthy nice foods but it's not important the the foods but it's not important the the hadza the hunter gatherers of tanzan hadza the hunter gatherers of tanzan have a very very good gut microbiome have a very very good gut microbiome they don't make kimchi they don't eat they don't make kimchi they don't eat kefir they eat everything that day the kefir they eat everything that day the reason they have it is they eat a lot of reason they have it is they eat a lot of variety of foods often plants very variety of foods often plants very fibrous that's the basic thing and with fibrous that's the basic thing and with blood sugar I think um uh I think it's blood sugar I think um uh I think it's become a bit of a marketing uh thing to become a bit of a marketing uh thing to be honest that these continuous blood be honest that these continuous blood glucose monitors have opened up the glucose monitors have opened up the opportunity for people to sell you apps opportunity for people to sell you apps and things which will enable you to spot and things which will enable you to spot the spikes in your blood sugar and the spikes in your blood sugar and actually you know the experts I spoke to actually you know the experts I spoke to again more in detail for the piece which again more in detail for the piece which came out in the guardian they'd say look came out in the guardian they'd say look these monitors are a good clinical these monitors are a good clinical they're clinical tools for people with they're clinical tools for people with diabetes if you don't have diabetes if diabetes if you don't have diabetes if you're pre-diabetic they give you very you're pre-diabetic they give you very limited information worse than that it limited information worse than that it can make you anxious because people see can make you anxious because people see a spike and they go oh my God and they a spike and they go oh my God and they think they can't eat that thing again think they can't eat that thing again whatever it might be so a few changes whatever it might be so a few changes there the other change I think is around there the other change I think is around my attitude towards fish farming I think my attitude towards fish farming I think I had a very negative view of that I had a very negative view of that because I'd heard about it mainly in the because I'd heard about it mainly in the context of all the bad practice and context of all the bad practice and there's a lot of bad practice in fish there's a lot of bad practice in fish farming but it made me recognize that farming but it made me recognize that there are good better and worse ways of there are good better and worse ways of doing it and the um good fish farming doing it and the um good fish farming good aquaculture is probably going to good aquaculture is probably going to have to play a role in our future food have to play a role in our future food system I did not see uh SE spiracy system I did not see uh SE spiracy during the pandemic when I think it was during the pandemic when I think it was reled um I decided to to not burden reled um I decided to to not burden myself with more bad news fish farming myself with more bad news fish farming and intensive fish farming is of course and intensive fish farming is of course an important topic we now have our an important topic we now have our starters in front of us so apologies starters in front of us so apologies listeners give us pause to describe listeners give us pause to describe what's on our plate here we have hisy what's on our plate here we have hisy cabbage hisy cabbage which is charred cabbage hisy cabbage which is charred it's with smoked trout trout farmed fish it's with smoked trout trout farmed fish right it's farmed but you know this is right it's farmed but you know this is from stream Farm I know where it comes from stream Farm I know where it comes from which is uh not so far from here in from which is uh not so far from here in Somerset and they're like a community Somerset and they're like a community Enterprise they're lovely people their Enterprise they're lovely people their smoke trout is is some of the best you smoke trout is is some of the best you could ever get I think you know and it could ever get I think you know and it

it's a lemon butter yes it's smok trout it's charred cabbage it's not smok trout it's charred cabbage it's not in in in theory I mean we we say the previous theory I mean we we say the previous iteration of this had Brown iteration of this had Brown shrimp and we used to we so we went home shrimp and we used to we so we went home and did a version of it ourselves I know and did a version of it ourselves I know it would taste better with a glass but it would taste better with a glass but I'm going to is this still but I think I'm going to is this still but I think you the fact we're undercover we're well you the fact we're undercover we're well covered and we're in the middle of storm covered and we're in the middle of storm BT or Bret whatever it is and some BT or Bret whatever it is and some people might think that's a bit crazy people might think that's a bit crazy and there are a few reasons for doing it and there are a few reasons for doing it one is that I still prefer being in an one is that I still prefer being in an Airy outdoor space over an indoor Airy outdoor space over an indoor crowded space if possible just to avoid crowded space if possible just to avoid flu colds and everything also the flu colds and everything also the indoors in this place is very compact I indoors in this place is very compact I think it' be a bit think it' be a bit awkward and I think you're absolutely awkward and I think you're absolutely right so that's true um but the third right so that's true um but the third thing is isn't really a reason but I've thing is isn't really a reason but I've really got to kind of like having sort really got to kind of like having sort of Cho choosing to be outdoors more I've of Cho choosing to be outdoors more I've got to like it a lot I also do a lot of got to like it a lot I also do a lot of walking this is how I I stay fit and walking this is how I I stay fit and exercise people often say to me exercise people often say to me particularly in the summer that they particularly in the summer that they think I've been somewhere because my my think I've been somewhere because my my my face is so Brown and that it stops at my face is so Brown and that it stops at the neck it's just because I'm walking the neck it's just because I'm walking around all the time you know you know around all the time you know you know what now that you mention that and and what now that you mention that and and people listen to this on audio only people listen to this on audio only won't know what on Earth I'm talking won't know what on Earth I'm talking about but yeah you you always had if I about but yeah you you always had if I may use the phrase a look of rude Health may use the phrase a look of rude Health it's just playing tennis and walking the it's just playing tennis and walking the streets and as I say my torso is is milk streets and as I say my torso is is milk it's it's it's terrible but your face is it's it's it's terrible but your face is blood my face is yeah it actually gets blood my face is yeah it actually gets quite red but the other thing is I mean quite red but the other thing is I mean the other thing about that you get to the other thing about that you get to like about being outdoors is yeah people like about being outdoors is yeah people say you should eat seasonally right well say you should eat seasonally right well that's not getting more in touch with that's not getting more in touch with the seasons being outdoors in general the seasons being outdoors in general yeah people talk about The Great yeah people talk about The Great Outdoors they think that means the Outdoors they think that means the countryside well you know in a sense countryside well you know in a sense almost all Outdoors is great when you're almost all Outdoors is great when you're Outdoors you you do feel a bit more Outdoors you you do feel a bit more connected and you understand you know connected and you understand you know you say the seasonality things change so you say the seasonality things change so to be eating undercover undercover we're to be eating undercover undercover we're fine we got heaters we're dry we can see fine we got heaters we're dry we can see we can feel that it is a November day we can feel that it is a November day that it is a stormy day so we're just that it is a stormy day so we're just feeling a little bit more I don't know feeling a little bit more I don't know fully in in our world maybe I agree I fully in in our world maybe I agree I agree it kind of goes back to what we agree it kind of goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning were talking about at the beginning wasn't it about engagement engagement wasn't it about engagement engagement with the reality of the world that we with the reality of the world that we inhabit not being disconnected from it inhabit not being disconnected from it so we just finished our hisy cabbage so we just finished our hisy cabbage which was absolutely delicious I think which was absolutely delicious I think as we were eating I said that I thought as we were eating I said that I thought that the lemon butter is what made it um that the lemon butter is what made it um and uh and of course you enjoyed it as and uh and of course you enjoyed it as well and and then we got on to a well and and then we got on to a conversation about alcohol and I conversation about alcohol and I wondered to what extent alcohol featured wondered to what extent alcohol featured in the book but you said you had a few in the book but you said you had a few things to say about this yeah I mean in things to say about this yeah I mean in the book it doesn't really feature very the book it doesn't really feature very much to be honest um but alcohol is an much to be honest um but alcohol is an interesting topic for sure you know why interesting topic for sure you know why do we drink people generally drink too do we drink people generally drink too much there's a big debate about what is much there's a big debate about what is healthy and what isn't cultural healthy and what isn't cultural identities play a big part and the identities play a big part and the consumption of alcohol well absolutely consumption of alcohol well absolutely yeah I mean culture is very enormously yeah I mean culture is very enormously in alcohol Norms um so my father's in alcohol Norms um so my father's Italian in Italy the alcohol culture is Italian in Italy the alcohol culture is very very interesting it's all about very very interesting it's all about moderation to be drunk is a shame and an moderation to be drunk is a shame and an embarrassment but people would embarrassment but people would traditionally drink some alcohol every traditionally drink some alcohol every day you know is it crude to say that day you know is it crude to say that generally speaking it's northern generally speaking it's northern European countries that have developed European countries that have developed this kind of ritual of what you might this kind of ritual of what you might call Feast drinking it it it it seems to call Feast drinking it it it it seems to be does is it I'm not quite sure how it be does is it I'm not quite sure how it works in in sort of places of Asia CU works in in sort of places of Asia CU alcohol is drunk all over the world but alcohol is drunk all over the world but yeah climate is probably one factor I yeah climate is probably one factor I not because you know obviously in warmer not because you know obviously in warmer climates you suffer much more for climates you suffer much more for getting getting getting Rocklyn climates cut to where we are and Rocklyn climates cut to where we are and you think to yourself she's quite you think to yourself she's quite warming and pleasant um to do that I warming and pleasant um to do that I think there's also to me I think there's think there's also to me I think there's also a Protestant and a and a Catholic also a Protestant and a and a Catholic thing going on a bit I think the English thing going on a bit I think the English this is I did talk about this in my this is I did talk about this in my previous book actually the Protestant previous book actually the Protestant cultures you have this sort of cultures you have this sort of puritanism sin is food is seen as puritanism sin is food is seen as somewhat sinful and bad and that leads somewhat sinful and bad and that leads these kind of binge Purge Cycles so you these kind of binge Purge Cycles so you get this sort of much more binge Purge get this sort of much more binge Purge type thing going on in northern European type thing going on in northern European cultures whereas you know in the cultures whereas you know in the southern European War Catholic ones you southern European War Catholic ones you know Ironically in a way for some reason know Ironically in a way for some reason they don't have that same puritanism they don't have that same puritanism around food and drink and therefore it's around food and drink and therefore it's just more just something you enjoy and just more just something you enjoy and of course you enjoy it but you don't go of course you enjoy it but you don't go Bonkers so often I have to say you know Bonkers so often I have to say you know I'm I was brought up Protestant and only I'm I was brought up Protestant and only my maltes blood kind of leans Catholic my maltes blood kind of leans Catholic but I have to say I hate the Protestant but I have to say I hate the Protestant ethic not in all respects I'm not making ethic not in all respects I'm not making a grand statement on religious tradition a grand statement on religious tradition but particularly when it comes to food but particularly when it comes to food and drink and the the binge Purge cycles and drink and the the binge Purge cycles that you talk about you know in sort of that you talk about you know in sort of more secular society colleagues maybe in more secular society colleagues maybe in the city of London may use phrases like the city of London may use phrases like eating is cheesing when we go out that eating is cheesing when we go out that sort of idea just utter nonsense really sort of idea just utter nonsense really really toxic unhealthy nonsense and then really toxic unhealthy nonsense and then people wonder why we're so fat and sick people wonder why we're so fat and sick and malnourished I mean I'm completely and malnourished I mean I'm completely with you um let's pause now because yeah with you um let's pause now because yeah our main course has arrived our main our main course has arrived our main courses have arrived and what we see in courses have arrived and what we see in front of us is um dark dark with some front of us is um dark dark with some some sort of greens and Botti beans um some sort of greens and Botti beans um I'm not a huge meat eater I often have I'm not a huge meat eater I often have meat here because I mean first of all I meat here because I mean first of all I don't like to eat meat unless I'm don't like to eat meat unless I'm confident about his saucing and one confident about his saucing and one thing here is you can is trust isn't it thing here is you can is trust isn't it the point is that you can't know where the point is that you can't know where all your food comes from for sure you all your food comes from for sure you have to rely on certain things some have to rely on certain things some people rely on certification schemes Etc people rely on certification schemes Etc but ultimately the end of the day all but ultimately the end of the day all these things the basis is trust and I these things the basis is trust and I just trust these guys that they're going just trust these guys that they're going to get good stuff and the way they do it to get good stuff and the way they do it he always going to be so nice so another he always going to be so nice so another wonderful description um bear with us wonderful description um bear with us listeners we'll be back oh gosh smacking our lips after back oh gosh smacking our lips after that that was excellent um reminded of that that was excellent um reminded of our previous guest Tom Reed Wilson a our previous guest Tom Reed Wilson a word Smith discussing the um problem of word Smith discussing the um problem of of finding new adjectives to describe of finding new adjectives to describe tasty things how everybody always tasty things how everybody always reaches for delicious toothsome that was reaches for delicious toothsome that was a very toothsome lunch that's one of a very toothsome lunch that's one of Tom's favorites um no that was excellent Tom's favorites um no that was excellent so yeah sorry to continue my rant and so yeah sorry to continue my rant and apologies listeners I don't I don't wish apologies listeners I don't I don't wish to preach as I say what I'm really to preach as I say what I'm really railing against in talking about alcohol railing against in talking about alcohol is the binge Purge cycles that you is the binge Purge cycles that you outlined earlier jul and you know outlined earlier jul and you know there's some worrying statistics out there's some worrying statistics out there we've often thought of alcohol as there we've often thought of alcohol as being fine in moderation the World being fine in moderation the World Health Organization has come out with Health Organization has come out with research showing that actually alcohol research showing that actually alcohol has really no health benefits at all has really no health benefits at all it's been reclassified as an adverse it's been reclassified as an adverse substance but you have some thoughts substance but you have some thoughts about how we view alcohol and perhaps about how we view alcohol and perhaps how some of this new research and the how some of this new research and the the idea of no alcohol is better than the idea of no alcohol is better than some alcohol can be challenged yeah I me some alcohol can be challenged yeah I me I'm totally open to the fact that I'm totally open to the fact that whenever we talk about food or drink we whenever we talk about food or drink we have to remember that there's what's have to remember that there's what's good for the body and then there is the good for the body and then there is the slightly more mystical element which is slightly more mystical element which is does it make you happy and is that good does it make you happy and is that good for you that's true and of course these for you that's true and of course these two things are related of course you two things are related of course you know if you are happier more content know if you are happier more content more relaxed in general that's good for more relaxed in general that's good for your health it can't funny enough can't your health it can't funny enough can't he can say something he actually um died he can say something he actually um died after eating too much cheese he liked after eating too much cheese he liked English cheddar for some reason did he English cheddar for some reason did he really yeah and he died of eating really yeah and he died of eating English cheddar he he he died of it as a English cheddar he he he died of it as a little bit whatever but he was warned little bit whatever but he was warned against eating too much some people against eating too much some people would blame it on Che but he got his would blame it on Che but he got his walking every day though he got his walk walking every day though he got his walk in every day he was known as yeah people in every day he was known as yeah people think of K as the most sort of like think of K as the most sort of like rigorous dry cerebral thinker but he rigorous dry cerebral thinker but he used to enjoy leisurely lunches of used to enjoy leisurely lunches of discussion with people and he actually discussion with people and he actually wrote Some of how wine you know it wrote Some of how wine you know it softens Hearts it opens people up he softens Hearts it opens people up he thought wine was it's his IDE of the thought wine was it's his IDE of the social lubricant he wasn't talk about social lubricant he wasn't talk about getting kind of put people a little bit of ease kind of put people a little bit of ease Etc now arguably you can say you don't Etc now arguably you can say you don't need alcohol to do that and that's true need alcohol to do that and that's true but when it's very nice I mean this but when it's very nice I mean this glass of wine I'm I'm being very um yeah glass of wine I'm I'm being very um yeah I'm being quite good with it actually I'm being quite good with it actually because it's just the one glass and I'm because it's just the one glass and I'm still only about halfway through it's so still only about halfway through it's so nice and it obviously works well with nice and it obviously works well with the food on the health issues I mean the food on the health issues I mean this is one of those things where you this is one of those things where you know one I'm not a doctor right so you know one I'm not a doctor right so you why don't you listen to a doctor rather why don't you listen to a doctor rather than me um well the point is one of the than me um well the point is one of the important things about philosophy is important things about philosophy is that there there are all sorts of that there there are all sorts of different expertises and as non-experts different expertises and as non-experts we have to make sense of these things we have to make sense of these things for us and and the point is that for us and and the point is that sometimes that just means simply sometimes that just means simply listening to what the experts tell us listening to what the experts tell us but often we have to be careful we have but often we have to be careful we have to sort of understand what they're to sort of understand what they're telling us and telling us and why and with alcohol it is confusing why and with alcohol it is confusing we're not getting the same message from we're not getting the same message from all experts now what seems to be all experts now what seems to be happening is there's a bit of a happening is there's a bit of a direction of travel in which it's gone direction of travel in which it's gone from the idea of moderate drinking being from the idea of moderate drinking being either neutral or POS L good for you so either neutral or POS L good for you so there being no safe level for there being no safe level for alcohol and I've been following this for alcohol and I've been following this for quite a long while and I'm just not quite a long while and I'm just not persuaded and there are various reasons persuaded and there are various reasons for this so this is where actually it's for this so this is where actually it's not just about philosophical things it's not just about philosophical things it's about General critical thinking skills about General critical thinking skills one's got to understand what numbers one's got to understand what numbers tell you what data tells tell you what data tells you let's start with a bit of data this you let's start with a bit of data this could be I don't want to get too could be I don't want to get too involved people who are in favor mod at involved people who are in favor mod at drinking often point to this thing drinking often point to this thing called the J curve which showed that called the J curve which showed that when you look at all cause mortality when you look at all cause mortality moderate drinkers actually had longer moderate drinkers actually had longer life expectancies than tea totals and life expectancies than tea totals and and even people who drank a lot is only and even people who drank a lot is only then then when people drink very heavily then then when people drink very heavily their health outcomes get worse and their health outcomes get worse and that's not been entirely debunked it's that's not been entirely debunked it's been questioned because people say that been questioned because people say that among the people who don't drink at all among the people who don't drink at all there are people who don't drink at all there are people who don't drink at all because of alcohol rated health issues because of alcohol rated health issues which means they which means they can't even so even if you factor in that can't even so even if you factor in that in if you allow for that it still seems in if you allow for that it still seems that the all cause mortality is quite that the all cause mortality is quite flat the other point is that even if it flat the other point is that even if it is true that with every glass of drink is true that with every glass of drink your risk of death goes up as an your risk of death goes up as an individual you got to ask yourself yes individual you got to ask yourself yes but is that a big enough risk for me to but is that a big enough risk for me to change my behavior every time I cross a change my behavior every time I cross a road I increase my risk of being run road I increase my risk of being run over by a car does that mean I should over by a car does that mean I should not cross any roads well of course not not cross any roads well of course not it means I should cross carefully no I it means I should cross carefully no I though if your risk of dying in a car though if your risk of dying in a car accident crossing the road was accident crossing the road was cumulative yeah okay let's forget the cumulative yeah okay let's forget the crossing the road an allergy then let crossing the road an allergy then let say let's say it's true that with every say let's say it's true that with every glass of wine you drink your risk of glass of wine you drink your risk of death increases you got to ask by how death increases you got to ask by how much right now if having like 20 units a much right now if having like 20 units a week on average reduces my life week on average reduces my life expectancy by 2 weeks is that a reason expectancy by 2 weeks is that a reason to stop drinking I don't think so so I to stop drinking I don't think so so I think you know that that's the other think you know that that's the other issue as well around that I think which issue as well around that I think which is that people got to think about over a is that people got to think about over a population level it is the case that population level it is the case that more of X leads to more bad outcome that more of X leads to more bad outcome that doesn't mean that as an individual it it doesn't mean that as an individual it it necessarily makes sense for you to alter necessarily makes sense for you to alter your behavior but the other point is B your behavior but the other point is B more fundamentally is I'm not yet more fundamentally is I'm not yet convinced that that is even true that convinced that that is even true that even there is a moderate increase even there is a moderate increase because the the the papers and studies because the the the papers and studies I've read which argue the case for no I've read which argue the case for no moderate drinking they focus on some moderate drinking they focus on some very common things like some Cancers and very common things like some Cancers and some heart disease and they show the some heart disease and they show the incidents of those go up with every unit incidents of those go up with every unit of alcohol that people drink I've yet to of alcohol that people drink I've yet to see something which says for all cause see something which says for all cause mortality it goes up and that's the mortality it goes up and that's the thing that really matters to me as an thing that really matters to me as an individual it doesn't matter to me what individual it doesn't matter to me what I die of it matters that I die or not so I die of it matters that I die or not so if it is true that three of the most if it is true that three of the most common diseases are made more dangerous common diseases are made more dangerous by alcohol as as I said first of all if by alcohol as as I said first of all if it as long as do make them much more it as long as do make them much more likely that's something I can live with likely that's something I can live with but um even if even if those things go but um even if even if those things go up I want to know whether overall I'm up I want to know whether overall I'm going to be more likely to die through going to be more likely to die through drinking alcohol and I think the the drinking alcohol and I think the the jury is still out on that I wanted to jury is still out on that I wanted to talk a little bit about what you alluded talk a little bit about what you alluded to earlier with regards to class and to earlier with regards to class and food just because it's um a topic that food just because it's um a topic that is seemingly Evergreen in the UK um and is seemingly Evergreen in the UK um and given that our audiences is mostly from given that our audiences is mostly from this this this country we tend to bracket all advice country we tend to bracket all advice around what to eat and what is perhaps around what to eat and what is perhaps better or better sourced around well who better or better sourced around well who can afford to do that on the one hand can afford to do that on the one hand it's about the practice of how we make it's about the practice of how we make the food that is Affordable and the the food that is Affordable and the practices of appreciating what's practices of appreciating what's available to all and that's to do with available to all and that's to do with culinary skill and that's to do with culinary skill and that's to do with education of how to cook and how it's education of how to cook and how it's passed down but also the very fact that passed down but also the very fact that what works for somebody in a position to what works for somebody in a position to afford Whole Foods and organic foods afford Whole Foods and organic foods simply doesn't and cannot for somebody simply doesn't and cannot for somebody who can't class of food it is a big a who can't class of food it is a big a big issue and I think that intentionally big issue and I think that intentionally or not a lot of advice around healthy or not a lot of advice around healthy eating ends up sounding extremely eating ends up sounding extremely condescending um so there's one idea condescending um so there's one idea that anyone can eat well as long as they that anyone can eat well as long as they have the skills because look I can make have the skills because look I can make a delicious meal from you know Dar and a delicious meal from you know Dar and rice and it's nutritious and that's kind rice and it's nutritious and that's kind of true but come on we're all products of true but come on we're all products of our cultures and you know look at the of our cultures and you know look at the culture we've grown up in are you really culture we've grown up in are you really expecting people to do that it also expecting people to do that it also requires time A lot of people are time requires time A lot of people are time po the other thing is it requires energy po the other thing is it requires energy if your if your power is on a meter if your if your power is on a meter which you read with a smart card or a which you read with a smart card or a coin to put on your oven for like an coin to put on your oven for like an hour is probably something you may not hour is probably something you may not want to do so there's a huge you may not want to do so there's a huge sort of snobbery around that I think sort of snobbery around that I think that the issue of poverty is an that the issue of poverty is an important important important one but they got a simple you might even one but they got a simple you might even you may say simplistic but I think it's you may say simplistic but I think it's just a simple response to this the just a simple response to this the there's too much talk now of food there's too much talk now of food Poverty of heat Poverty of period Poverty of heat Poverty of period poverty it's just all poverty right food poverty it's just all poverty right food needs food needs to be more expensive needs food needs to be more expensive because the cheap food is unsustainable because the cheap food is unsustainable but that means that minimum incomes have but that means that minimum incomes have to be high enough to afford it so so the to be high enough to afford it so so the solution to to to food poverty is a solution to to to food poverty is a solution to Poverty minimum minimum solution to Poverty minimum minimum income should be sufficient to afford a income should be sufficient to afford a decent diet the solution isn't to keep decent diet the solution isn't to keep bad food bad food bad food cheap um so that's a real issue but the cheap um so that's a real issue but the other thing is I think that one thing other thing is I think that one thing I've become increasingly aware of I I've become increasingly aware of I think even since finishing the book is think even since finishing the book is actually how and I I really like to actually how and I I really like to write something about this that write something about this that we really have like two food worlds and we really have like two food worlds and that they they don't really meet there's that they they don't really meet there's one food World which is the world of the one food World which is the world of the informed or informed or informed or interested often but not exclusively interested often but not exclusively middle class person who appreciates middle class person who appreciates cooking from raw cooking from raw ingredients um preferably all those good ingredients um preferably all those good things around seasonal local maybe things around seasonal local maybe organic whatever it might be has time organic whatever it might be has time has time too and skill you know and has time too and skill you know and experience and then there's the world of experience and then there's the world of the person who subsists largely on the person who subsists largely on industrially produced food um as we know industrially produced food um as we know in this country I think 60% of calories in this country I think 60% of calories come from Ultra processed food given come from Ultra processed food given that that's an that that's an average um that means a lot of people average um that means a lot of people are getting loads of there because I are getting loads of there because I mean my percentage of ultra processed mean my percentage of ultra processed foods in my diet I mean the way it is foods in my diet I mean the way it is categorized it's not zero but you know categorized it's not zero but you know it's going to be 5% I'd know what it 10 it's going to be 5% I'd know what it 10 if we were lucky um so some people are if we were lucky um so some people are having a hair a lot there and and you having a hair a lot there and and you know people again they've grown up like know people again they've grown up like this I I I know what it's like when I this I I I know what it's like when I was a child we live in a culture in was a child we live in a culture in which people have the food culture is which people have the food culture is one which involves buying things which one which involves buying things which have been manufactured to reheat at home have been manufactured to reheat at home and that is the way people eat and I and that is the way people eat and I think that when people talk about how we think that when people talk about how we need to improve health need to improve health outcomes getting people to cook from raw outcomes getting people to cook from raw ingredients Etc is only part of the ingredients Etc is only part of the story we also need to make sure that story we also need to make sure that those foods are healthier and better for those foods are healthier and better for them and contain animals that have been them and contain animals that have been treated well well rather than Factory treated well well rather than Factory you know treated intensively and and you know treated intensively and and cruy all right uh we've got the desserts cruy all right uh we've got the desserts in front of us and you know what you in front of us and you know what you want already Julie have the chocolate want already Julie have the chocolate mousse cuz you can't say no to that well mousse cuz you can't say no to that well you can cuz you could say yes to you can cuz you could say yes to something else if I'm going to say no to something else if I'm going to say no to that and say yes to a cinnamon pan of that and say yes to a cinnamon pan of Cota please yeah that also sounds good I Cota please yeah that also sounds good I have to say on on the subject of uh have to say on on the subject of uh pudding or dessert that's a class issue pudding or dessert that's a class issue do you say pudding or dessert well do you say pudding or dessert well that's quite right isn't it I mean look that's quite right isn't it I mean look food this is the thing food is food this is the thing food is absolutely Riven with class anxieties absolutely Riven with class anxieties and class um grudges I mean look if you and class um grudges I mean look if you have somebody let's just say for once a have somebody let's just say for once a fairer stereotype or a fairer example a fairer stereotype or a fairer example a Tory MP if they utter the words working Tory MP if they utter the words working people aren't bothered about organic people aren't bothered about organic produce in in an attempt to sound like produce in in an attempt to sound like they understand I I imagine a lot of they understand I I imagine a lot of Working Class People would say how dare Working Class People would say how dare you it's got nothing to do with what I you it's got nothing to do with what I care about I don't have time for this care about I don't have time for this however to Hero working person Fox however to Hero working person Fox popped on the street or asked to you popped on the street or asked to you know give their opinion on question time know give their opinion on question time or whatever say the same thing yeah or whatever say the same thing yeah would be seen as an authentic assertion would be seen as an authentic assertion on behalf of of a demographic so we have on behalf of of a demographic so we have a real problem in this country don't we a real problem in this country don't we with who gets to say what about what with who gets to say what about what class of person and whether it comes class of person and whether it comes from them or comes from somebody else from them or comes from somebody else whether it's true or whether it's simply whether it's true or whether it's simply about letting the people who it affects about letting the people who it affects say what they would prefer food is very say what they would prefer food is very personal you you don't want anyone personal you you don't want anyone telling you what you should want to eat telling you what you should want to eat and yet you may know through the and yet you may know through the morbidities in your your own family morbidities in your your own family cases of cancer and diabetes and heart cases of cancer and diabetes and heart attacks that the food you are eating and attacks that the food you are eating and that they're eating is killing you yeah that they're eating is killing you yeah no it's true the the class Dynamics in no it's true the the class Dynamics in food are very very complicated just the food are very very complicated just the vocabulary is this a seriet or is it a vocabulary is this a seriet or is it a napkin again you're going to give napkin again you're going to give yourself away commenting on what the yourself away commenting on what the spoon's balancing on there EXA you know spoon's balancing on there EXA you know so I mean all all sorts of things that so I mean all all sorts of things that go on there and I think it's it's a go on there and I think it's it's a particular I mean there are everywhere particular I mean there are everywhere you go in the world there are you go in the world there are inequalities around food inequalities around food which you know are based on what you which you know are based on what you might call class or at least socio might call class or at least socio economic economic economic position our class system is still seems position our class system is still seems to be peculiar and extreme and there are to be peculiar and extreme and there are lots of cultures in which if you take lots of cultures in which if you take Italian food for example I mean people Italian food for example I mean people will celebrate it they'll say it's a will celebrate it they'll say it's a peasant Cuisine what is the relationship peasant Cuisine what is the relationship between class and food in Italy I'm I'm between class and food in Italy I'm I'm fascinated to really understand this fascinated to really understand this from somebody who knows the country and from somebody who knows the country and culture I'm not I'm not sure how well I culture I'm not I'm not sure how well I know it today but I mean I mean in the know it today but I mean I mean in the past I mean you know Italy was a very past I mean you know Italy was a very very poor country in the early part of very poor country in the early part of the 20th century late 19th century and the 20th century late 19th century and it would be seen in what people could it would be seen in what people could afford to eat so where I came from in afford to eat so where I came from in the north people would be eating a lot the north people would be eating a lot of pentes the cheapest calories you of pentes the cheapest calories you could get basically and it's fascinating could get basically and it's fascinating CU you know that is what they would have CU you know that is what they would have been eating that and rice and yet even been eating that and rice and yet even from the time I went as a child no one from the time I went as a child no one ate plent anymore and it's because with ate plent anymore and it's because with they're eating pasta which they didn't they're eating pasta which they didn't used to eat hardly at all in the past it used to eat hardly at all in the past it wasn't it wasn't the national food of wasn't it wasn't the national food of itally until postwar as people's incomes itally until postwar as people's incomes got a bit better yeah I mean people ate got a bit better yeah I mean people ate good food and it was celebrated as as good food and it was celebrated as as peasant food so I think the the peasant food so I think the the socioeconomic thing in in in Italy would socioeconomic thing in in in Italy would be of course if you're wealthier you'll be of course if you're wealthier you'll be able to avoid to afford nicer wines be able to avoid to afford nicer wines and things like that but you you would and things like that but you you would you wouldn't be kind you wouldn't be kind of unless you're going to a fancy of unless you're going to a fancy restaurant you know probably you would restaurant you know probably you would be proud to eat the same kind of food as be proud to eat the same kind of food as people who are more workingclass you people who are more workingclass you know yeah you just might be able to know yeah you just might be able to afford a bit more meat and a bit more afford a bit more meat and a bit more fish and yeah no quite exactly I mean fish and yeah no quite exactly I mean you do see a market difference people you do see a market difference people often come back from holidays to places often come back from holidays to places abroad places like Italy France Spain abroad places like Italy France Spain Etc and um aside from looking healthy Etc and um aside from looking healthy and tan they also comment on the fact and tan they also comment on the fact that there's an that there's an uncomplicated character to eating and uncomplicated character to eating and and a communitarian approach too which and a communitarian approach too which which is missing here I mean another which is missing here I mean another thing is quite interesting is the is the thing is quite interesting is the is the concept of like fast food or whatever concept of like fast food or whatever you want to call it because obviously you want to call it because obviously here that's associated with a big class here that's associated with a big class things around that workingclass people things around that workingclass people who eat too much fast food they say very who eat too much fast food they say very interesting you know in the age of uber interesting you know in the age of uber and all that kind of stuff you know I and all that kind of stuff you know I think that a lot of middle class people think that a lot of middle class people are eating fast food they're just eating are eating fast food they're just eating more expensive uh fast food which is more expensive uh fast food which is still coming to them and healthier fast still coming to them and healthier fast food fast food food and healthier fast food fast food has become healthier although it has has become healthier although it has although you know again not all I mean although you know again not all I mean again people can get very snotty about a again people can get very snotty about a ready meal but if you go to an average ready meal but if you go to an average restaurant there was what was it the um restaurant there was what was it the um I think it was Tim Haywood great food I think it was Tim Haywood great food right at the Ft he said that the the the right at the Ft he said that the the the the secret of of kitchen restaurants the secret of of kitchen restaurants which people don't realize is they they which people don't realize is they they use you know more more salt than you use you know more more salt than you could imagine and more fat than you dare could imagine and more fat than you dare something like this you know there's a something like this you know there's a lot of people don't see what goes into lot of people don't see what goes into their kitchen food and if it was on the their kitchen food and if it was on the side of that particularly the salt side of that particularly the salt levels in restaurants often very very levels in restaurants often very very high absolutely I mean we're not passing high absolutely I mean we're not passing judgment on boxy of course I mean judgment on boxy of course I mean everything felt as I mentioned earlier everything felt as I mentioned earlier perfectly balanced but you're right I perfectly balanced but you're right I mean Anthony bourd the late chef and TV mean Anthony bourd the late chef and TV celebrity said the same didn't he that celebrity said the same didn't he that you can bet that there's a stick of you can bet that there's a stick of butter and more in the whole of a three butter and more in the whole of a three course meal that you've e well having course meal that you've e well having said that you my Italian ants when I said that you my Italian ants when I asked them the secret of their risotto asked them the secret of their risotto their answer was B butter butter butter their answer was B butter butter butter but the thing about again the thing but the thing about again the thing about here what's wrong with fast food about here what's wrong with fast food what's wrong with the prepared food in what's wrong with the prepared food in general nothing I I have only been to general nothing I I have only been to Africa on on one trip and I was in East Africa on on one trip and I was in East Africa and what I noticed there was it Africa and what I noticed there was it was really really striking that there was really really striking that there were these Street kitchens if you like were these Street kitchens if you like that there are places in in campala that there are places in in campala where there'd be almost always a woman where there'd be almost always a woman she had three or four she had three or four pots and she would serve a meal of a pots and she would serve a meal of a stew which should have some kind of rice stew which should have some kind of rice or something some grain vegetables maybe or something some grain vegetables maybe a bit of meat it costs next to nothing a bit of meat it costs next to nothing and poor people ate there and the reason and poor people ate there and the reason they ate there was that one of the they ate there was that one of the biggest costs in producing food is biggest costs in producing food is energy it is much more economic for one energy it is much more economic for one person to be making big pots and is for person to be making big pots and is for each person in their own house to do it each person in their own house to do it of course that's the way people used to of course that's the way people used to bake bread as well of course because you bake bread as well of course because you know um well actually Bakers ovens were know um well actually Bakers ovens were used to cook you know the baker's ovens used to cook you know the baker's ovens were used to to roast your meat you'd were used to to roast your meat you'd pay a small fee because having your own pay a small fee because having your own oven was was too expensive basically so oven was was too expensive basically so there's nothing inherently wrong in there's nothing inherently wrong in buying street food in buying fast food buying street food in buying fast food Etc it just has to be better so again so Etc it just has to be better so again so so you know when we're thinking about so you know when we're thinking about how we need to improve our food system how we need to improve our food system we can't let the best be the enemy of we can't let the best be the enemy of the good which is so often what happens the good which is so often what happens um we can't hold out for the day where um we can't hold out for the day where everyone's got the time and skill and everyone's got the time and skill and interest as well interest let's be interest as well interest let's be honest to cook from scratch at home we honest to cook from scratch at home we need to make sure that the convenience need to make sure that the convenience meals are better for them better for the meals are better for them better for the economy better for the environment and economy better for the environment and better for the PE the human beings in better for the PE the human beings in the labor chain as well because you know the labor chain as well because you know let's be honest the food system is let's be honest the food system is riddled with the exploitation of human riddled with the exploitation of human beings from the underpaid kitchen Porter beings from the underpaid kitchen Porter to the the the the child picking cocoa to the the the the child picking cocoa and coffee in in in West Africa look and coffee in in in West Africa look there's a lot to get through in this there's a lot to get through in this book Julian and a lot of it as you've book Julian and a lot of it as you've alluded to there with human exploitation alluded to there with human exploitation quite heavy in nature I wonder whether quite heavy in nature I wonder whether if I were to ask you to say Which if I were to ask you to say Which chapter you would direct the reader to chapter you would direct the reader to get a flavor no pun intended but also a get a flavor no pun intended but also a real sense of the importance of what you real sense of the importance of what you write about in this book what chapter write about in this book what chapter would that be I'm going to answer you would that be I'm going to answer you indirectly my aim in the book was that indirectly my aim in the book was that each of these chapters you could you each of these chapters you could you could read by itself that cumulatively could read by itself that cumulatively you're meant to we meant to be a a sort you're meant to we meant to be a a sort of like spot the patterns the of like spot the patterns the similarities draw out the
