## 1. The 1934 Harvard Experiment

***"A practical joke was turned into a conclusive experiment"***

In late 1934, at the Harvard School of Public Health, William Firth Wells and his assistant Richard Riley conducted a groundbreaking demonstration of airborne disease transmission. During a sanitation class, Wells activated a specially designed air centrifuge - a device that used centrifugal force to capture particles from the air onto sticky cylinders coated with human blood. Twenty minutes before the end of class, Wells released sneezing powder into the room's air outlet, causing students in the back to sneeze. The centrifuge ran with different cylinders at timed intervals: one during the sneezing period, another ten minutes later, and a third after everyone had left.

The results were striking. The first cylinder showed no bacterial colonies, the second contained 2,200 colonies, and the third had 920 colonies. These were colonies of harmless mouth bacteria that had been expelled through sneezing, demonstrating that microorganisms could travel through the air across significant distances and remain suspended long enough to be inhaled by others. Wells called these suspended particles "droplet nuclei" - small droplets that had evaporated enough to float in air currents rather than falling immediately to the ground.

## 2. Historical Perspectives on Air and Disease

***"When the air is full of miasmas whose properties are hostile to human nature, this is when men are ill"***

For millennia, humans recognized air's vital importance while also fearing its potential dangers. Hippocrates developed the concept of "miasma" - corrupted or pestilential air that caused disease. This theory explained why multiple people in the same location would fall ill simultaneously. The miasma theory dominated medical thinking for over 2,000 years, with diseases like malaria (literally "bad air") being attributed to atmospheric corruption.

Even after microorganisms were discovered in the 1670s, and some scientists suggested they might cause disease, the miasma theory persisted. During the 1831 cholera outbreak in Europe, authorities remained convinced that foul air from waste and specific meteorological conditions caused the epidemic. The theory was so entrenched that even as the germ theory began gaining ground in the late 1800s, many medical professionals continued attributing diseases to corrupted air rather than specific microbes.

## 3. The Germ Theory Revolution

***"I can kill a thousand people with this, but you my students are going to go out and you are going to save people's lives"***

The transformation from miasma theory to germ theory occurred through the work of scientists like Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, who coined the term "bacteria" and documented an "atmospheric kingdom of life." Louis Pasteur's experiments in the 1850s proved that microbes didn't spontaneously generate but descended from other microbes, even demonstrating bacteria collection from glacier air. Robert Koch identified specific bacteria causing diseases like cholera and tuberculosis.

In 1892, both Germany and Massachusetts experienced watershed moments in public health. Koch successfully stopped a cholera outbreak in Hamburg by treating contaminated water, while William Sedgwick traced a typhoid outbreak in Lowell to sewage-contaminated river water. These successes established the paradigm that diseases spread through water, food, and direct contact - not air. Charles Chapin, who became the leader of American public health in the early 1900s, declared it "a great relief to most people to be freed from the specter of infected air."

## 4. William Wells' Journey to Airborne Research

***"The failure of public health to deliver mankind from the 1918 pandemic of influenza"***

William Wells trained at MIT under Sedgwick, initially focusing on waterborne diseases, particularly typhoid in oysters. His success in developing water purification methods earned him the nickname "oyster godfather." During World War I, he provided clean water to soldiers but witnessed the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 50-100 million people worldwide, including his own sister at age 27.

After losing his job during the Great Depression, Wells joined Harvard School of Public Health. Inspired by an old aerobioscope device and his engineering background, he recognized the inadequacy of existing air sampling methods. Drawing on his experience with cream separators used in oyster research, he invented the Wells air centrifuge around 1931. This device could continuously sample large volumes of air, using centrifugal force to fling airborne particles onto collection cylinders.

## 5. Mildred Wells and Polio Research

***"No one is better fitted than a woman to collect data such as this book contains"***

Mildred Wells, William's wife and a trained physician, began studying polio epidemiology when William lost his job during the Depression. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, she became convinced that polio might spread through airborne droplets. Her work appeared in a comprehensive book on polio, though all authors were women and the medical establishment gave it only backhanded compliments, ignoring her airborne transmission hypothesis.

Despite the dismissive reception, Mildred's work influenced William's research direction. She remained committed to the airborne infection theory throughout her career, conducting experiments in schools and eventually an entire town. Her final experiment in Pleasantville, New York, involved installing UV lights throughout the community - in churches, train stations, movie theaters, and shops - attempting to prove definitively that air disinfection could prevent disease transmission.

## 6. UV Light Disinfection Discovery

***"We are going to have ultraviolet light everywhere, we are going to be protected from diseases like influenza"***

Wells discovered that ultraviolet light effectively killed airborne pathogens, including influenza viruses. His 1936 paper created a sensation, with hospitals and public transportation systems rushing to install UV lamps. A school in Philadelphia equipped with UV lights showed remarkable protection during a 1940 measles outbreak - the worst in years - with minimal cases compared to other schools.

The UV lamps were positioned to shine upward, avoiding direct exposure to people while disinfecting air as it circulated. Wells and his team demonstrated that UV light could provide the same protection for air that chlorination provided for water. Trains in Maine installed UV systems, and hospitals began using them to protect patients. However, conflicts with Harvard administrators over patents and credit led to the Wells' dismissal from Harvard.

## 7. The Laboratory for Airborne Infection

***"A wizard whom I found irresistible"***

After being fired from Harvard, the Wells established the Laboratory for the Study of Airborne Infection at the University of Pennsylvania. They developed the "infection machine" - a sophisticated apparatus that delivered controlled doses of airborne pathogens to test animals. The device could precisely regulate pathogen concentration, demonstrating that disease severity correlated with the amount of airborne pathogen inhaled.

The experiments proved definitively that influenza and tuberculosis could spread through air, and that UV light could prevent transmission. During World War II, while the Wells were excluded from military research, the U.S. Army secretly used their designs to develop biological weapons at Camp Detrick, creating military-grade infection machines for testing lethal doses of pathogens like anthrax.

## 8. The Lock Raven Tuberculosis Experiments

***"A perfect cycle was thus completed"***

In the 1950s, Wells and Richard Riley conducted definitive experiments at Lock Raven VA Hospital proving tuberculosis was airborne. They housed tuberculosis patients in sealed rooms with ventilation systems that carried their exhaled air to a penthouse containing guinea pigs. The guinea pigs developed tuberculosis from breathing the patients' air, and UV lights in the ventilation system could prevent infection.

Tragically, Wells collapsed from cancer and psychosis during these experiments and was hospitalized at Lock Raven itself. For two years, he lay dying in a hospital bed while overhead, his life's work was being validated. He died in 1963, and even after these compelling results, the medical establishment remained skeptical. Ronald Hare stated just a month after Wells' death that it was "extremely doubtful whether droplet nuclei play any important part in the transmission of respiratory infection."

## 9. COVID-19 and the Rediscovery of Airborne Transmission

***"The World Health Organization emphatically stating March 28th that COVID is not airborne"***

The COVID-19 pandemic initially saw authorities dismissing airborne transmission, with people focusing on surface disinfection. Scientists who understood the Wells' work immediately recognized COVID's airborne nature but faced resistance from established public health organizations. The scientific community eventually shifted to acknowledge airborne transmission, leading to a renaissance in appreciation for the Wells' pioneering research.

Modern technology now allows study of airborne diseases at scales impossible for the Wells. Researchers can sequence DNA and RNA from air samples in real time, track disease spread through wastewater monitoring, and develop sophisticated ventilation standards. Scientists have called for mandated ventilation requirements in buildings, comparable to water quality standards, recognizing that clean air deserves the same regulatory attention as clean water.

## 10. Current Threats and Future Challenges

***"The pathogens don't care, they're going to move through the air, we are going to breathe them in whether we understand what's happening or not"***

Bird flu (H5N1) currently circulates among cattle, cats, and other mammals, spreading primarily through contaminated milking equipment but showing potential for airborne transmission. While dairy workers have experienced mostly mild infections through eye exposure, the virus continues adapting to mammalian hosts, raising pandemic concerns.

Research funding faces severe threats, with laboratories losing hundreds of thousands of dollars and universities accepting fewer graduate students. The infrastructure for studying airborne pathogens, built over decades, risks dismantling just as new technologies promise breakthroughs in real-time air monitoring and pathogen detection. Historical precedents from countries that dismantled scientific research, like the Soviet Union's destruction of genetics research under Lysenko, demonstrate that recovery can take generations - if it happens at all.
