**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. Ancient Crossroads and Native American Heritage

***"This is arguably the oldest intersection in New York, predating European contact by many centuries."***

Astor Place represents the intersection of two ancient Native American roads that shaped Manhattan's development for centuries. The north-south Wickquasgeck Trail, later renamed the Bowery Road by Dutch colonists, connected New Amsterdam at Manhattan's southern tip to farms in the north. This highway intersected with Kintecoying, meaning "crossroads of three nations," an east-west route connecting the fertile fishing marshes of the East River to the Native American village of Sapokanikan on the Hudson River's shore.

The village of Sapokanikan, located where Greenwich Village now stands, derived its name from a Lenape word indicating soil particularly suitable for growing tobacco. When Dutch Governor Wouter van Twiller acquired this land, he continued the tobacco farming tradition, calling his estate **Noortwyck** (Northern District). The property later became known as **Groenwijck** (Forested District), eventually anglicized to Greenwich when the British took control in 1664.

## 2. The Erie Canal's Revolutionary Impact

***"When the Erie Canal opened, it transformed New York, not just the city, but all the cities along the path of the canal and the Hudson River with about half of the nation's GDP almost overnight redirected down the canal."***

The 1825 opening of the Erie Canal fundamentally transformed New York City's economic and physical landscape. Travel time between the western United States and the east coast decreased by **70%**, while shipping costs plummeted by up to **90%**. This economic revolution triggered a massive population explosion as commerce flooded into New York Harbor.

Prior to the canal's opening, Greenwich Village remained isolated from the city by the **Lispenard Meadows**, a tidal marsh fed by springs beneath present-day Chinatown. The city drained this marsh by constructing a small canal to divert freshwater to the Hudson River. When this waterway became clogged with refuse and dead animals, authorities covered it, creating the city's first sewer line - today's **Canal Street**. This infrastructure project opened the newly created neighborhoods of Tribeca and Soho for development just as the Erie Canal brought unprecedented growth to the city.

## 3. Washington Square's Macabre Foundation

***"There are currently between 20 and 25,000 people buried underneath Washington Square Park."***

For approximately 30 years before 1825, the land now occupied by Washington Square served as the city's public burial ground for disease victims, executed criminals, and anyone deemed unsuitable for churchyard burial. When the Erie Canal's opening made the area attractive for wealthy development, the city closed the potter's field in 1825 and landscaped it, reopening the space as **Washington Parade Ground** in 1827.

Developers immediately capitalized on this new green space, constructing elegant townhouses around the square. The north side of Washington Square still preserves many of these 1830s-1840s mansions, though most are now owned by NYU. The rapid transformation from burial ground to elite neighborhood exemplifies Manhattan's relentless northward development during this period.

## 4. Industrial Transformation and Tragedy

***"There's just 34 years separating the death of the Commodore at number 10 Washington Place and the death of 146 immigrant women and girls in the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire just across the street."***

The departure of wealthy residents like **Cornelius Vanderbilt** from Washington Square marked a dramatic neighborhood transformation. Vanderbilt, who rose from a Staten Island farm boy to become worth $100 million at his death in 1877, had chosen to build his mansion at 10 Washington Place in 1846. When this generation of wealthy residents died, no comparable demographic waited to purchase their old-fashioned downtown properties.

Speculative developers demolished these mansions, replacing them with industrial lofts. The most infamous was the building at Greene Street and Washington Place, where the **Triangle Shirtwaist Company** occupied the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors. On March 25, 1911, a fire broke out on the 8th floor. With doors locked and fire department equipment inadequate - ladders too short and nets too weak - **146 people died**, mostly young immigrant women. This tragedy sparked a cascade of workplace safety laws that transformed American labor conditions.

## 5. Seventh Avenue's Violent Creation

***"The city used eminent domain to take more than 300 properties in the path of a new street and subway line, demolish them and slice Greenwich Village open."***

Seventh Avenue originally terminated at Greenwich Avenue, never bisecting Greenwich Village. In the 1910s, city planners wanted both a west side subway extension and improved automobile access to the under-construction Holland Tunnel. Using eminent domain powers, authorities seized and demolished **over 300 properties** to carve the avenue through Greenwich Village's heart.

The most contentious demolition involved the **Voorhees apartment building**, owned by Philadelphian David Hess. After losing his legal battle against the city, Hess discovered officials had accidentally omitted an 18-inch triangle of his property from the seizure documents. Rather than sell this tiny parcel, he embedded a mosaic plaque reading **"Property of the Hess Estate, which has never been dedicated for public purposes"** - still visible today in the sidewalk.

## 6. Sacred Spaces and Cemetery Relocations

***"That little triangle cemetery not only speaks to the history of this illustrious Jewish congregation, again the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Western Hemisphere, but it also is one of the few places where you can actively see the clash between the diagonal kooky grid of Greenwich Village and the more regimented numbered grid of the city."***

The **Second Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue Cemetery**, established in 1805 by Congregation Shearith Israel, represents both religious heritage and urban planning conflicts. The congregation, the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Western Hemisphere, established their first cemetery in the 1680s near Chatham Square. When that filled, they purchased a rectangular plot outside Greenwich Village for their second cemetery.

The 1811 street grid plan placed this cemetery directly in 11th Street's path. In 1829, the city ordered the congregation to relocate their dead. They moved many bodies to the triangular remnant still visible today at 11th Street and Sixth Avenue, transferring others to their third cemetery on West 21st Street. This small triangle provides physical evidence of the collision between Greenwich Village's diagonal colonial-era property lines and Manhattan's rectilinear grid system.

## 7. Jefferson Market's Civic Evolution

***"Ramshackle complexes like this serving a governmental function were an embarrassment to us at this time."***

Jefferson Market opened in 1833 as Greenwich Village transformed from seasonal retreat to permanent neighborhood. The original complex combined market stalls, assembly rooms, police facilities, jail cells, and a 100-foot wooden fire tower. By the 1860s, New York's Gilded Age ambitions demanded more dignified civic architecture.

The city demolished the original structures in the late 1860s, replacing them with a **High Victorian Gothic** courthouse complex designed by Frederick Clarke Withers. The beautiful tower that defines today's skyline served the same fire-watching function as its wooden predecessor. By the early 20th century, the market system had become obsolete. The courthouse closed in the 1940s, nearly facing demolition in the 1960s before preservation efforts transformed it into Greenwich Village's branch of the New York Public Library.

## 8. The Queer Liberation Movement's Complex Origins

***"While Julius's was a place where you could go and it was just a bar and it was a lot of white men in suits who otherwise when they left Julius's passed for mainstream society, Stonewall as an explicitly gay mob-owned bar tended to cater to people who could not escape into society."***

The queer liberation movement emerged through multiple acts of resistance across Greenwich Village. At **Julius's bar** on April 21, 1966, three Mattachine Society members staged the "Sip-in," deliberately announcing their homosexuality while ordering drinks. When refused service, press photographers captured the moment, leading to clarification that homosexuals weren't inherently prohibited from ordering alcohol.

Three years later at the **Stonewall Inn**, owned by the Genovese crime family, a routine police raid on June 28, 1969 sparked violent resistance. The demographic difference proved crucial - Julius's attracted middle-class white men who could blend into mainstream society, while Stonewall served non-white, gender non-conforming individuals, and sex workers who faced constant harassment.

Eight months after Stonewall, at the **Snake Pit** basement bar, police arrested 167 men. Diego Vinales, a 23-year-old Argentine immigrant, attempted escape by jumping from a police station window, impaling himself on a fence. Though he survived, rumors of his death sparked protests that galvanized support for what became the **Christopher Street Liberation Day march** - the world's first Pride parade.

## 9. Architectural Oddities and Relocations

***"The house was loaded onto a flatbed truck, hauled down York Avenue to 57th Street, across 57th to Second, down Second Avenue to 14th Street, across 14th Street to the Meatpacking District where it wended its way down to the corner of Charles and Greenwich."***

Number **121 Charles Street** stands as Greenwich Village's "weirdest house," originally built as a rear rental property at 1335 York Avenue. Children's author **Margaret Wise Brown** rented this cottage from 1943-1953, writing approximately 100 books there, including *Goodnight Moon*.

When threatened with demolition in the 1960s, Swedish immigrants Sven and Ingrid Bernhard successfully sued for ownership based on their restoration investments. They purchased an empty corner lot where two tenements had collapsed, then orchestrated the house's remarkable journey through Manhattan streets. Mayor John Lindsay helped cut bureaucratic red tape, allowing the structure's relocation to Greenwich Village, where neighbors welcomed it with a banner reading "Bernhard Homestead: Welcome to Greenwich Village."

The **Isaac Hendricks House** at Bedford and Commerce Streets, built in 1799, represents one of Manhattan's few surviving 18th-century structures. Its distinctive brick cutouts on the Commerce Street side prevented fireplace heat from damaging the exterior walls. Adjacent to it stands **75½ Bedford Street**, Manhattan's narrowest house, built in the 1890s in a former carriageway.

## 10. Hidden Burial Grounds

***"James J. Walker Park down near Houston Street, still very popular with soccer and baseball with a playground and a swimming pool and Keith Haring murals, still has about 15,000 bodies underneath it."***

Multiple parks in Greenwich Village conceal former cemeteries. **Hudson Park** (now James J. Walker Park) served as St. Luke's Episcopal cemetery from 1834 to 1898. When the overgrown cemetery was ordered closed in the 1890s, the city simply covered it and created a park, leaving approximately **15,000 bodies** beneath the current soccer fields, playgrounds, and swimming pool.

The park's elegant stone and iron fence, designed by Carrère and Hastings (architects of the New York Public Library and Frick Collection), provides the only visible reminder of the site's funerary past. This pattern of converting burial grounds to parks without removing bodies reflects Manhattan's pragmatic approach to urban development throughout the 19th century.

## 11. The Living Legacy of the Hangman's Elm

***"This tree has lived through and borne witness to... It was a hundred years old when George Washington was inaugurated as our first president. It was close to 200 years old when the Civil War broke out."***

The **Hangman's Elm** at Washington Square's northwest corner, approximately 350 years old, stands as Manhattan's oldest tree. Despite its nickname, no documented hangings occurred there. As an English elm rather than a native species, some early European settler deliberately planted it along the Minetta Brook's banks three and a half centuries ago.

This non-native origin partially explains its survival through the 20th century's elm blight. The tree has witnessed Greenwich Village's entire evolution - from Native American settlement through Dutch tobacco farms, from potter's field to elite neighborhood, through waves of immigration, bohemianism, and gentrification. Its continued vitality, with first branches starting four stories above ground, provides a living connection to every era of New York history.
