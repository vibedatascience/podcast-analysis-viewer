good evening everyone um as you've heard good evening everyone um as you've heard I've lost my voice I'm going to start I've lost my voice I'm going to start like this I might end up having to like this I might end up having to whisper I think it'll be Audible and whisper I think it'll be Audible and it'll be an experiment already losing my it'll be an experiment already losing my voice has taught me something I had a voice has taught me something I had a complex cattle hering operation to complex cattle hering operation to accomplish today and I did it without accomplish today and I did it without once having to raise my voice I've been once having to raise my voice I've been increasingly treating my cattle with increasingly treating my cattle with more and more kindness since I first got more and more kindness since I first got the herd several years ago and they the herd several years ago and they really respond to being treated gently a really respond to being treated gently a bit like children the nicer you are to bit like children the nicer you are to them the nicer they are to you but I them the nicer they are to you but I hadn't realized that they had got to the hadn't realized that they had got to the point where I didn't even have to raise point where I didn't even have to raise my voice to get them to do what I needed my voice to get them to do what I needed them to do and so the universe has them to do and so the universe has gifted me this and I'm hoping I wasn't gifted me this and I'm hoping I wasn't planning to raise my voice at Julian planning to raise my voice at Julian though it was tempting when I read what though it was tempting when I read what he wrote about me in his he wrote about me in his pug um but it does mean perhaps I'll pug um but it does mean perhaps I'll talk less than I might have otherwise talk less than I might have otherwise done and and I think that would be good done and and I think that would be good for for for everyone um but the other thing I had to everyone um but the other thing I had to do this morning was uh put down the do this morning was uh put down the matriarch of my cattle herd She's been matriarch of my cattle herd She's been with me from the beginning she's the with me from the beginning she's the mother aunt and grandmother of many of mother aunt and grandmother of many of the cows in my herd and and yesterday the cows in my herd and and yesterday when I was hurting them across the when I was hurting them across the valley she got to the valley she got to the Ford and decided she couldn't go Ford and decided she couldn't go on and she stood on one side and the on and she stood on one side and the herd stood on the other and there was a herd stood on the other and there was a lot of mooving back and forth and lot of mooving back and forth and eventually the herd left her left her eventually the herd left her left her behind and what would have happened in behind and what would have happened in the wild last night is the Wolves would the wild last night is the Wolves would have come and picked her off and this have come and picked her off and this morning I had to take on that Grim roll morning I had to take on that Grim roll and my daughter's made some videos of and my daughter's made some videos of them reading funeral cow poems and them reading funeral cow poems and saying goodbye to to Bridget her name saying goodbye to to Bridget her name was um and when the shot came she she was um and when the shot came she she didn't even have a moment to Flinch an didn't even have a moment to Flinch an apprehension me it was a really big apprehension me it was a really big moment and it brings me to one of the moment and it brings me to one of the core principles in Julian BG core core principles in Julian BG core principles that I resonate with a great principles that I resonate with a great deal in what he calls a philosophy of deal in what he calls a philosophy of food and that is the principle of food and that is the principle of compassion and compassion can lead us compassion and compassion can lead us into lots of different places towards into lots of different places towards each other towards the animals towards each other towards the animals towards the Earth that we live on but I think if the Earth that we live on but I think if I have I have I have one absolutely core principle on which one absolutely core principle on which all of our food decisions indeed all of all of our food decisions indeed all of our actions could be based compassion our actions could be based compassion has got to be right there at the top so has got to be right there at the top so I wonder if we can start with that I wonder if we can start with that Julian Julian Julian yeah thank you very much for that it's a yeah thank you very much for that it's a very um moving story I think I think very um moving story I think I think you're it's a excellent story to start you're it's a excellent story to start us off really because I think the most us off really because I think the most people I think they know but they look people I think they know but they look away from the fact that one of the away from the fact that one of the biggest problems with our food system at biggest problems with our food system at the moment are all the issues around the moment are all the issues around animals in the food animals in the food system um there are huge environmental system um there are huge environmental issues around around the scale of it and issues around around the scale of it and they're also and interesting what I find they're also and interesting what I find slightly dispiriting is it seems to me slightly dispiriting is it seems to me that when people decide they're not that when people decide they're not going to eat meat their their their going to eat meat their their their reasons seem to be these days primarily reasons seem to be these days primarily Health some people think it's healthier Health some people think it's healthier not to so it's the self-interest kicks not to so it's the self-interest kicks in and they think about the in and they think about the environmental issues become more Salient environmental issues become more Salient but I think the welfare issue has been but I think the welfare issue has been so well known for such a long time and I so well known for such a long time and I think a lot of people I think one of the think a lot of people I think one of the problems is we' we do like things to be problems is we' we do like things to be simple and I think people think you know simple and I think people think you know they they don't if they they don't want they they don't if they they don't want to be vegetarian or vegan so they just to be vegetarian or vegan so they just carry on eating the meat and dairy when carry on eating the meat and dairy when we have huge amount of choice about what we have huge amount of choice about what kind of meat and dairy we eat now you kind of meat and dairy we eat now you got the kind of herd and you know your got the kind of herd and you know your story says it all you've got the kind of story says it all you've got the kind of herd that everyone would like every herd herd that everyone would like every herd to be like right where the farmer is is to be like right where the farmer is is caring and compassionate and the cows caring and compassionate and the cows are out grazing when they when they can are out grazing when they when they can they're probably shedded over winter for they're probably shedded over winter for some of the time I would imagine as most some of the time I would imagine as most herds are or as you're out all year m a herds are or as you're out all year m a wild cattle they don't even go in fields wild cattle they don't even go in fields that's amazing they roam the Wilderness that's amazing they roam the Wilderness all the year round I mean there are all the year round I mean there are there are herds you know which are there are herds you know which are largely Freer ranging most most will be largely Freer ranging most most will be shedded for at least some of the winter shedded for at least some of the winter which some people would argue is is is which some people would argue is is is is better for their welfare when the is better for their welfare when the conditions are terrible outside but the conditions are terrible outside but the point is there there is that need to point is there there is that need to sort of be be mindful and careful of sort of be be mindful and careful of them and the thing about compassion here them and the thing about compassion here is that I think a lot of us we we're in is that I think a lot of us we we're in the center of London uh a lot of us are the center of London uh a lot of us are completely kind of you know we we're completely kind of you know we we're alienated from nature in the raw and so alienated from nature in the raw and so you know we don't like to think about you know we don't like to think about death and killing and meat and so forth death and killing and meat and so forth and that makes us very screamish about and that makes us very screamish about it but I I kind of think that and I I it but I I kind of think that and I I don't blame anyone who wants to express don't blame anyone who wants to express their compassion for Animals by simply their compassion for Animals by simply not eating any I respect that choice I not eating any I respect that choice I think it's admirable and it's you're think it's admirable and it's you're doing a lot more than the than the doing a lot more than the than the probably the 90% of the people who don't probably the 90% of the people who don't change their habits but I do think it's change their habits but I do think it's importantly another way of having a real importantly another way of having a real engagement and compassionate engagement engagement and compassionate engagement with animals which does involve their with animals which does involve their killing and eating and I think you're an killing and eating and I think you're an example of it cuz as you say when we example of it cuz as you say when we think about um farming of animals I think about um farming of animals I think a lot of people who sort of like think a lot of people who sort of like end up being vegetarian or vegan for end up being vegetarian or vegan for welfare reasons think that no matter how welfare reasons think that no matter how good the farmer is they're still killing good the farmer is they're still killing and there's still going to be some and there's still going to be some suffering etc etc but the question to suffering etc etc but the question to ask really is yes but what's the ask really is yes but what's the situation in the wild and as you say in situation in the wild and as you say in the wild when the cow dies they low down the wild when the cow dies they low down in the field and the Wolves will get in the field and the Wolves will get them and it won't be a very nice death them and it won't be a very nice death right um the the woman I spoke to who right um the the woman I spoke to who has cattle in the Pampers for my book um has cattle in the Pampers for my book um I mean that's the most incredible that's I mean that's the most incredible that's free range gon Bonkers you know you free range gon Bonkers you know you could you could look for miles and not could you could look for miles and not even see a cow there's so much land for even see a cow there's so much land for them but as she says you know if you see them but as she says you know if you see a pummer gets hold of a cow it's not a a pummer gets hold of a cow it's not a pretty sight you know whereas when the pretty sight you know whereas when the day comes for them to slaughter them day comes for them to slaughter them humanely it it's really a much more humanely it it's really a much more Humane and compassionate process and I Humane and compassionate process and I think I don't want to ramble too long at think I don't want to ramble too long at the same time I'm also aware we need to the same time I'm also aware we need to save your voice a bit but I think I save your voice a bit but I think I think that one thing we we learn here is think that one thing we we learn here is when when we look at uh what we call when when we look at uh what we call traditional societies traditional traditional societies traditional societies is like a technical term societies is like a technical term really what it means is societies who really what it means is societies who continue to live in ways which are continue to live in ways which are largely continuous with their long largely continuous with their long history that's that's all it means and history that's that's all it means and traditional societies have a very traditional societies have a very interesting relationship with the interesting relationship with the animals that they eat they often express animals that they eat they often express it in terms of kinship so the Inuit have it in terms of kinship so the Inuit have this idea they have kinship with the this idea they have kinship with the seal and they feel there's almost like a seal and they feel there's almost like a packed between the human and the seal packed between the human and the seal and the mingling of the human and seal and the mingling of the human and seal blood is their way of um describing that blood is their way of um describing that the the Massi who are the the Massi who are pastoralists um their diet is is based pastoralists um their diet is is based primarily on milk and then on blood and primarily on milk and then on blood and then on meat they eat very few then on meat they eat very few vegetables again they kind of rever vegetables again they kind of rever their cattle and they they have cattle their cattle and they they have cattle names for each other and then one of the names for each other and then one of the names for the massai is actually a name names for the massai is actually a name for cattle so what we see time and again for cattle so what we see time and again is that in traditional societies where is that in traditional societies where people still have that deep connection people still have that deep connection with nature nature they have a reverence with nature nature they have a reverence and respect for the animals which is and respect for the animals which is entirely compatible with the killing and entirely compatible with the killing and the eating of them and I think this the the eating of them and I think this the so whether you want to go along that or so whether you want to go along that or not as I said I'm not having to go at not as I said I'm not having to go at people who are vegetarian or vegan people who are vegetarian or vegan because as I say their their concern is because as I say their their concern is they're expressing a concern in in a they're expressing a concern in in a good way but I think there's a way of of good way but I think there's a way of of of being compassionate which is also I of being compassionate which is also I think very realistic accepting the fact think very realistic accepting the fact that death and killing um the eating of that death and killing um the eating of meat is a necessary part of our food meat is a necessary part of our food system um it's not necessary for us to system um it's not necessary for us to do it we could opt out but for other do it we could opt out but for other animals it's absolutely necessary when animals it's absolutely necessary when you take away the carnivores things like you take away the carnivores things like deer you need to do culling because deer you need to do culling because otherwise they take over so I think we otherwise they take over so I think we should think about you know the the need should think about you know the the need for compassion and how we express that for compassion and how we express that and if we're not going to express that and if we're not going to express that through simply refraining from eating through simply refraining from eating meat and animals we ought to think about meat and animals we ought to think about how we have that proper relationship how we have that proper relationship with them and that to to sort of bring with them and that to to sort of bring another sort of big theme in that kind another sort of big theme in that kind of capacity is simply not compatible of capacity is simply not compatible with the scale of animal um products with the scale of animal um products that we eat today because we can only that we eat today because we can only maintain the volume of meat Dairy and maintain the volume of meat Dairy and eggs that we have by intensive farming eggs that we have by intensive farming which um is not only not good for the which um is not only not good for the animals it's an environmental disaster animals it's an environmental disaster um I will say I get my I'll get my long um I will say I get my I'll get my long spear out first because as we know um spear out first because as we know um there are lots of environmental issues there are lots of environmental issues around meat and dairy but a lot of that around meat and dairy but a lot of that big chunk of that is because uh most big chunk of that is because uh most meat and dairy is being um meat and dairy is being um fed crops which are grown entirely to fed crops which are grown entirely to feed the animals so you know forests and feed the animals so you know forests and other sort of Virgin land and and other sort of Virgin land and and Wildland is being turned over to Wildland is being turned over to cultivation it's harming biodiversity cultivation it's harming biodiversity it's taking out carbon sinks Etc it's it's taking out carbon sinks Etc it's creating a huge amount of emissions and creating a huge amount of emissions and all this is being done to produce feed all this is being done to produce feed to give to animals and because we want to give to animals and because we want so many of them whereas there is an so many of them whereas there is an alternative system in which we have meat alternative system in which we have meat and dairy in much less quantities than and dairy in much less quantities than most people eat most people eat um in which the animals are eating um in which the animals are eating edible parts of crops that humans parts edible parts of crops that humans parts of crops which are inedible to humans of crops which are inedible to humans but you're edible to animals like the but you're edible to animals like the straw the hay the silage etc etc pasture straw the hay the silage etc etc pasture land which isn't suitable for arable land which isn't suitable for arable arable arable farming although I know it arable arable farming although I know it could be useful for woodlands so that could be useful for woodlands so that could be it um but but there if we ate a could be it um but but there if we ate a moderate amount of meat we could do so moderate amount of meat we could do so in ways which don't have these in ways which don't have these environmentally destructive methods as environmentally destructive methods as well so all all Roots really do lead to well so all all Roots really do lead to I mean you may disagree with this but a I mean you may disagree with this but a lot of people talk about the idea of lot of people talk about the idea of less and better meat you know Less meat less and better meat you know Less meat but better in the terms of better for but better in the terms of better for welfare and better for the environment welfare and better for the environment doesn't always go together but they they doesn't always go together but they they can go together now just to have can go together now just to have interest were you having your little interest were you having your little Icebreaker question there about um about Icebreaker question there about um about what what you think can be different in what what you think can be different in 50 years time how many people thought a 50 years time how many people thought a big difference would be we'd be eating a big difference would be we'd be eating a lot of cultivated lab grown meat can you lot of cultivated lab grown meat can you just raise your hand if you thought that just raise your hand if you thought that Fair number yeah how many people thought Fair number yeah how many people thought the big difference would simply be be the big difference would simply be be having a lot less meat and dairy Did having a lot less meat and dairy Did anyone say that yeah okay so it's anyone say that yeah okay so it's interesting isn't it we we you started interesting isn't it we we you started he's good he started on on a issue which he's good he started on on a issue which we all know is is really core to the we all know is is really core to the future of Our Food future of Our Food Systems thank you Julian and let me Systems thank you Julian and let me emphasize the longer your answers the emphasize the longer your answers the more compassionate I'll consider you to more compassionate I'll consider you to be I just to reassure you I'm not be I just to reassure you I'm not actually in any pain whatsoever it's actually in any pain whatsoever it's just the voice has gone um but yes thank just the voice has gone um but yes thank you for that thoughtful um response I'd you for that thoughtful um response I'd be interested in another show of H how be interested in another show of H how many people have killed an animal to eat many people have killed an animal to eat it in this audience Julian you're also it in this audience Julian you're also included in this question no I have not included in this question no I have not personally killed animal to eat it no personally killed animal to eat it no I've been I've been to a slaughter house I've been I've been to a slaughter house can just so show see those hands again can just so show see those hands again really yeah a minority of us more than really yeah a minority of us more than I'd expect definitely definitely fish I'd expect definitely definitely fish count so I the idea that fish don't count so I the idea that fish don't count I've been on fishing boats where count I've been on fishing boats where fish clearly don't count and the way fish clearly don't count and the way they're treated is absolutely appalling they're treated is absolutely appalling you know people like Notch their heads you know people like Notch their heads to Mark who's caught that one and the to Mark who's caught that one and the other one while they're still alive it's other one while they're still alive it's just incontable Behavior towards fish just incontable Behavior towards fish the way we kill wild fish I mean it's the way we kill wild fish I mean it's just let them suffocate you know um not just let them suffocate you know um not much fun if you're a fish I imagine um yeah I kind of I think we can build on yeah I kind of I think we can build on the answer to this question because it the answer to this question because it does segue into another one of those does segue into another one of those core issues with food and overlaps with core issues with food and overlaps with it it's another com word I love atmology it it's another com word I love atmology and um of course come in compassion and and um of course come in compassion and the Comm in my next com word companion the Comm in my next com word companion share the same rout a companion Comm is share the same rout a companion Comm is the Latin for with of course and pan is the Latin for with of course and pan is the Latin for bread the Latin for bread and we have this word and it cognates of and we have this word and it cognates of it in many Latin languages K compo even it in many Latin languages K compo even in Greek we have copos all of these in Greek we have copos all of these point to what is in fact a universal point to what is in fact a universal human behavior which is did I is there a human behavior which is did I is there a Greek speaker in the audience did I Greek speaker in the audience did I pronounce it okay yeah okay so cro for pronounce it okay yeah okay so cro for sin is with and tropos food so again and sin is with and tropos food so again and it means the same thing right a partner it means the same thing right a partner or some kind of partnership and the or some kind of partnership and the metaphor is that the sharing of food metaphor is that the sharing of food together it is a universal human together it is a universal human behavior every single Society in the behavior every single Society in the world uses the sharing of food and world uses the sharing of food and eating together to form social bonds to eating together to form social bonds to build build build society and conversely we all know what society and conversely we all know what it would feel like to be left out of a it would feel like to be left out of a meal to be ostracized from the feast meal to be ostracized from the feast it's about the most stigmatizing thing it's about the most stigmatizing thing you can do to somebody and you can do to somebody and we do that on a global scale at the we do that on a global scale at the moment there's many people sitting at moment there's many people sitting at the table feasting While others go the table feasting While others go without and when we talk about a gr without and when we talk about a gr broken food system I often think well broken food system I often think well what is broken there well one of the what is broken there well one of the things that is broken is our things that is broken is our companionship with each other and our companionship with each other and our companionship with and for the companionship with and for the Earth food is one of the most and in my Earth food is one of the most and in my experience as a food campaigner food experience as a food campaigner food author and practitioner around food author and practitioner around food production and the sharing of food it's production and the sharing of food it's it's really one of the most potent it's really one of the most potent forces that we have the food system as forces that we have the food system as Julian has point now it's the most Julian has point now it's the most damaging thing humans do to planet Earth damaging thing humans do to planet Earth at the moment you know is the main cause at the moment you know is the main cause of species Extinction deforestation soil of species Extinction deforestation soil erosion by far the biggest user of fresh erosion by far the biggest user of fresh water it's the single biggest source of water it's the single biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions I mean it carbon dioxide emissions I mean it really is the source of so much of the really is the source of so much of the damage we do and yet we already know how damage we do and yet we already know how to do farming and that's one of the to do farming and that's one of the wonderful things and juli and no doubt wonderful things and juli and no doubt weave this in the balance between weave this in the balance between optimism and pessimism it's also the optimism and pessimism it's also the place where we can do restoration of the place where we can do restoration of the earth most effectively we can build earth most effectively we can build carbon up in the soils we can create carbon up in the soils we can create habitat rather than destroy it we can habitat rather than destroy it we can replenish replenish replenish aquifers rather than depleting them and aquifers rather than depleting them and build soils all while feeding people so build soils all while feeding people so it's also the place where hope hope lies it's also the place where hope hope lies I think in what we can do with the food I think in what we can do with the food system and bringing people together system and bringing people together around food around food around food that companionship that force of that companionship that force of companionship is I think really where we companionship is I think really where we can strive we can invest in that place can strive we can invest in that place in our hearts and in our practices and in our hearts and in our practices and really transform the world's food really transform the world's food system system system but but but but food has also become such a but food has also become such a polarizing place place where people polarizing place place where people fight and argue and fight and argue and disagree we've mentioned one already the disagree we've mentioned one already the vegetarian or vegan is the carnivore vegetarian or vegan is the carnivore debate but there's a thousand others and debate but there's a thousand others and many of them Julian touches on quite many of them Julian touches on quite sensitively the complexity the passions sensitively the complexity the passions and it drives people apart even people and it drives people apart even people who swear by the same principles of you who swear by the same principles of you know saving the planet or being know saving the planet or being Equitable will disagree on a fact and Equitable will disagree on a fact and then go to war with each other never then go to war with each other never speak again and that's um that's a speak again and that's um that's a paradox that force that food has and and paradox that force that food has and and when I feel deeply passionate about as when I feel deeply passionate about as well as being compassionate and Julian I well as being compassionate and Julian I I think I'm judging from your book and I think I'm judging from your book and knowing you personally a little bit um knowing you personally a little bit um it's one it's one it's one that close to your heart too yeah I that close to your heart too yeah I think that's true I mean one of the think that's true I mean one of the things that sort of led me to write the things that sort of led me to write the book was that you know I you know I'm a book was that you know I you know I'm a philosopher by background I've had a philosopher by background I've had a long interest in food and as I got more long interest in food and as I got more involved in the sort of food world and involved in the sort of food world and this thing called the food ethics this thing called the food ethics Council you just realized that that Council you just realized that that everything is really complicated right I everything is really complicated right I mean and it's just and it's all all more mean and it's just and it's all all more complicated than you could almost ever complicated than you could almost ever imagine and that means that nothing is imagine and that means that nothing is simplistic right there no Simple simplistic right there no Simple Solutions so one of the principles I Solutions so one of the principles I ended up endorsing was what I call ended up endorsing was what I call pluralism which is a you know stra it's pluralism which is a you know stra it's not anything goes pluralism isn't like not anything goes pluralism isn't like relativism it's not you can do what you relativism it's not you can do what you want but it's just the idea that there's want but it's just the idea that there's there's to to to um you know use a there's to to to um you know use a culinary metap there's more than one way culinary metap there's more than one way to cook a goose yeah pled of bad ways to to cook a goose yeah pled of bad ways to cook a goose as well but there's more cook a goose as well but there's more than one good way to do it and I think than one good way to do it and I think the same goes for our food and farming the same goes for our food and farming systems and I think one of the problems systems and I think one of the problems is that people often attach themselves is that people often attach themselves to one thing which works really well to one thing which works really well where they are and they see the results where they are and they see the results of it and they become sort of monom of it and they become sort of monom mancal about it so I think the most mancal about it so I think the most obvious one with this and you know this obvious one with this and you know this is the one that always raises a few is the one that always raises a few people's hackles un is Organics now I people's hackles un is Organics now I have this long running kind of a uh have this long running kind of a uh interesting sort of critical friend interesting sort of critical friend relationship with the organic movement relationship with the organic movement I'm actually a member of the soil I'm actually a member of the soil Association I buy a lot of organic food Association I buy a lot of organic food um I'm generally a supporter but I um I'm generally a supporter but I simply do not buy the idea that Organics simply do not buy the idea that Organics is the model which the whole world is the model which the whole world should follow that's what we have to do should follow that's what we have to do for for many many reasons and I think for for many many reasons and I think you know when you look at what kind of you know when you look at what kind of good practice we get in food and farming good practice we get in food and farming there is good practice in unlikely there is good practice in unlikely places um one example I'd give now I places um one example I'd give now I when we talk about this stuff people when we talk about this stuff people always talk about greenwashing etc etc always talk about greenwashing etc etc so they're always people are very so they're always people are very skeptical of anything which isn't kind skeptical of anything which isn't kind of totally kosher according to those of totally kosher according to those principles but I'm just persuaded by the principles but I'm just persuaded by the evidence so if I don't know how many of evidence so if I don't know how many of you saw the wild Isle series one of you saw the wild Isle series one of these Landmark BBC Nature Documentaries these Landmark BBC Nature Documentaries it was all about the British Isles they it was all about the British Isles they had like a bonus program which only went had like a bonus program which only went out on the I player which is all about out on the I player which is all about the the environment and and and our the the environment and and and our environment and in that episode they environment and in that episode they featured this guy who I subsequently featured this guy who I subsequently spoke to after the book actually uh spoke to after the book actually uh called Patrick Barky he runs a big farm called Patrick Barky he runs a big farm out in suffk or norol one of somewhere out in suffk or norol one of somewhere out out east and in in the documentary out out east and in in the documentary he says you know we're a proper he says you know we're a proper industrial farm right so he uses that industrial farm right so he uses that term now in most people's minds there's term now in most people's minds there's a simple dichotomy in the food system a simple dichotomy in the food system there's industrial farming like Boo his there's industrial farming like Boo his or there's like organic agroecological or there's like organic agroecological regenerative farming hooray or you boo regenerative farming hooray or you boo hits the other way around because there hits the other way around because there a lot of the people who are on the a lot of the people who are on the industrial side so you know we're the industrial side so you know we're the serious people who are getting the real serious people who are getting the real Ys and feeding the world and these Ys and feeding the world and these organic people are kind of like organic people are kind of like hobbyists who aren't really being hobbyists who aren't really being productive etc etc so there's there's productive etc etc so there's there's Mutual suspicion depending on which side Mutual suspicion depending on which side you are you see this as good and bad and you are you see this as good and bad and this divide is really really deep so to this divide is really really deep so to give you a graphic example of it in give you a graphic example of it in January I was were you at the any other January I was were you at the any other the Oxford food food conferences this the Oxford food food conferences this year I was you were I was I I was at the year I was you were I was I I was at the Oxford food conferences because there is Oxford food conferences because there is the Oxford farming conference which has the Oxford farming conference which has been going for years and it's the the been going for years and it's the the mainstream farming conference it's it mainstream farming conference it's it represents uh the academics and the most represents uh the academics and the most farmers who are following what we call farmers who are following what we call conventional agriculture that means it's conventional agriculture that means it's largely sort mechanized etc etc and largely sort mechanized etc etc and about 10 15 years ago um they started about 10 15 years ago um they started the Oxford real farming conference and the Oxford real farming conference and for very good reasons it was to for very good reasons it was to represent the kind of farmers who represent the kind of farmers who weren't really being represented to the weren't really being represented to the Oxford farming conference right so it's Oxford farming conference right so it's a very good reason to do it they started a very good reason to do it they started had it in parallel at the same time the had it in parallel at the same time the differences the differences in culture differences the differences in culture between the two are sort of almost like between the two are sort of almost like comical you couldn't make them up so for comical you couldn't make them up so for example the Oxford farming conference example the Oxford farming conference which been going very long time very which been going very long time very conventional there's an there's optional conventional there's an there's optional morning prayers in the chapel if you morning prayers in the chapel if you want to go and do that um at the Oxford want to go and do that um at the Oxford real farming conference there's optional real farming conference there's optional meditation for Farmers right and this meditation for Farmers right and this this is so you can see how this sort of this is so you can see how this sort of there's a whole set of values around there's a whole set of values around this but the point is that you know you this but the point is that you know you only have to kind of scratch the surface only have to kind of scratch the surface of this to recognize the fact that yes of this to recognize the fact that yes at the extremes of these two movements at the extremes of these two movements you have things in complete opposition you have things in complete opposition but heck of a lot of people are in the but heck of a lot of people are in the middle or you close to the middle so the middle or you close to the middle so the Patrick Barker going back to his farm Patrick Barker going back to his farm proper industrial farm he talks about it proper industrial farm he talks about it but you know they they do they they look but you know they they do they they look after their soils they and they've got after their soils they and they've got the data on it you know the animals that the data on it you know the animals that have come back the wildlife the have come back the wildlife the biodiversity so so you know they show biodiversity so so you know they show you can do environmentally sensitive you can do environmentally sensitive farming within the so-called mainstream farming within the so-called mainstream system and do it well and I think that system and do it well and I think that so often you know one of the things that so often you know one of the things that holds us back is that we're not looking holds us back is that we're not looking to sort of like you know find the to sort of like you know find the solutions that work uh and and take a solutions that work uh and and take a plurality of solutions because it really plurality of solutions because it really does depend I mean you are a farmer so does depend I mean you are a farmer so you you'll know this better than anybody you you'll know this better than anybody but you know what works in one field but you know what works in one field won't work on another field even even won't work on another field even even just half a mile away the next Valley just half a mile away the next Valley you know it's facing the the irrigation you know it's facing the the irrigation is a bit different it's facing a is a bit different it's facing a different s it's a bit more clay a bit different s it's a bit more clay a bit more whatever the idea that there's only more whatever the idea that there's only one way to farm is just in in insane I one way to farm is just in in insane I think and and that goes for pretty much think and and that goes for pretty much everything else in in the food system everything else in in the food system too so I think we really really need to too so I think we really really need to overcome this sort of um simplistic sort overcome this sort of um simplistic sort of tribalism in the food world and sort of tribalism in the food world and sort of try and sort of be a bit more kind of of try and sort of be a bit more kind of uh Cooperative on it you know a bit more uh Cooperative on it you know a bit more understanding each other and work work understanding each other and work work for what's best cuz because the other for what's best cuz because the other principle I think we have to think about principle I think we have to think about here is we are this is a fairly urgent here is we are this is a fairly urgent issue even if you believed in you with issue even if you believed in you with with great conviction in your half with great conviction in your half hearts that organic farming is indeed hearts that organic farming is indeed the best way to farm everywhere and for the best way to farm everywhere and for everyone you have to recognize the fact everyone you have to recognize the fact that the world is not going to go that the world is not going to go organic probably in the next Century if organic probably in the next Century if ever it just ain't going to happen so ever it just ain't going to happen so you can't pin your hopes to improving you can't pin your hopes to improving the system on you know everyone going the system on you know everyone going organic so you rather you should be organic so you rather you should be trying to drag the mainstream more in trying to drag the mainstream more in your direction yeah and not let the best your direction yeah and not let the best be the enemy of the good so I think you be the enemy of the good so I think you know so I say even if you do think that know so I say even if you do think that one of these models is the best for one of these models is the best for everyone and I don't think they are You' everyone and I don't think they are You' still got a reason to sort of like seek still got a reason to sort of like seek uh common ground and try and sort of uh common ground and try and sort of like come to some compromises maybe in like come to some compromises maybe in order to make things make things better order to make things make things better thank you Julian by the way I meant to thank you Julian by the way I meant to mention at the beginning it's a it's mention at the beginning it's a it's build as a Q&amp;A um but but we've all build as a Q&amp;A um but but we've all agreed that we're not going to try and agreed that we're not going to try and restrict you to cues it can be insults restrict you to cues it can be insults uh comments stories um brevity is uh comments stories um brevity is encouraged but you know do prepare a encouraged but you know do prepare a concise um argument or or statement if concise um argument or or statement if you like it's all going to be welcome you like it's all going to be welcome it's going to be more of a open it's going to be more of a open discussion than assuming that plur or discussion than assuming that plur or not we have the answers up here we don't not we have the answers up here we don't um but one of the I suppose that that um but one of the I suppose that that issue of pluralism brings us to at what issue of pluralism brings us to at what level these shs and your your book level these shs and your your book is looks for a philosophy of food and is looks for a philosophy of food and perhaps at some point maybe after this perhaps at some point maybe after this one or before this one as you wish you one or before this one as you wish you can help everyone understand what you can help everyone understand what you mean by a philosophy of food well and mean by a philosophy of food well and perhaps you can start with what you mean perhaps you can start with what you mean by philosophy that I mean anyone who by philosophy that I mean anyone who doesn't know Julian's work more doesn't know Julian's work more generally this is I mean I see as a generally this is I mean I see as a sequel he he wrote a book a while ago a sequel he he wrote a book a while ago a bestseller called how the world thinks bestseller called how the world thinks um he's a philosopher and and and now um he's a philosopher and and and now he's brought his philosophical mind to he's brought his philosophical mind to the question of food um but you know the question of food um but you know you've got the philosophy it comes up you've got the philosophy it comes up with lots of kind of conclusions about with lots of kind of conclusions about how we should and shouldn't do things how we should and shouldn't do things and then there's a question of at what and then there's a question of at what level there's ly us as individuals we're level there's ly us as individuals we're each of us moral agents of A Sort and we each of us moral agents of A Sort and we make choices that may or may not be make choices that may or may not be determined by our personal philosophies determined by our personal philosophies or ethics and then of course we've got or ethics and then of course we've got layers of government above that and the layers of government above that and the most powerful as we know layer of most powerful as we know layer of government in the world is the nation government in the world is the nation state government and so there's lots of state government and so there's lots of shs about what nation state governments shs about what nation state governments should and shouldn't do or what they should and shouldn't do or what they would do if they were following a a good would do if they were following a a good food food food philosophy philosophy philosophy but there's an argument to say but there's an argument to say that the nation that the nation state government system that governs state government system that governs most stuff in the world is the core most stuff in the world is the core problem because you know what is right problem because you know what is right for one for one for one parochial the interest of one parochial parochial the interest of one parochial subgroup of the human population which subgroup of the human population which is itself a subgroup of life on Earth um is itself a subgroup of life on Earth um what we get is a tragedy the commons what we get is a tragedy the commons very often countries go to various cops very often countries go to various cops and other International agreements with and other International agreements with the job description given to them by the job description given to them by their populations to go and fight for their populations to go and fight for the biggest slice of cake that they can the biggest slice of cake that they can get for us otherwise they're not doing get for us otherwise they're not doing their job and that's actually not their job and that's actually not necessarily the best way of making a necessarily the best way of making a decision that is best for everyone let decision that is best for everyone let alone for all the other alone for all the other nonhumans and so within your philosophy nonhumans and so within your philosophy or rather actually out with your philos or rather actually out with your philos out with your philosophy there's the out with your philosophy there's the question of for whom is the philosophy question of for whom is the philosophy designed for us as individuals us as you designed for us as individuals us as you know units being governed by nation know units being governed by nation states us as earthlings you know some states us as earthlings you know some some thoughts about that be really some thoughts about that be really welcome yeah okay this just go back to welcome yeah okay this just go back to what you're saying about what philosophy what you're saying about what philosophy is doing in this book um well it's doing is doing in this book um well it's doing two things I think one thing it's doing two things I think one thing it's doing is is is it's it's this isn't heavy duty it's it's this isn't heavy duty philosophy in the sense of I'm not philosophy in the sense of I'm not applying the sort of like maxim of a applying the sort of like maxim of a manual C Aristotle etc etc I think when manual C Aristotle etc etc I think when it comes to practical Affairs that kind it comes to practical Affairs that kind of Applied philosophy is often very of Applied philosophy is often very uninteresting and very unuseful I think uninteresting and very unuseful I think rather philosophy gives you a kind of rather philosophy gives you a kind of set of skills hopefully about how to set of skills hopefully about how to think of things and to join the dots think of things and to join the dots there's a quote I in the beginning I've there's a quote I in the beginning I've been doing Philosophy for decades now been doing Philosophy for decades now and one of the embarrassing things about and one of the embarrassing things about philosophy is that you you can't find a philosophy is that you you can't find a simple definition about what it is which simple definition about what it is which everyone agrees on which sort of like everyone agrees on which sort of like confirms most people's prejudices that confirms most people's prejudices that you know it's all hot air but Wilford you know it's all hot air but Wilford sellers I came across this wonderful sellers I came across this wonderful definition by Wilford sellers which is definition by Wilford sellers which is essentially um paraphrasing slightly it essentially um paraphrasing slightly it is about how things in the most General is about how things in the most General sense of the term hang together in the sense of the term hang together in the most General sense of the term right and most General sense of the term right and I think that's it sounds as quite comic I think that's it sounds as quite comic but it's kind of true because you know but it's kind of true because you know if you take something like knowledge if if you take something like knowledge if you're a scientist you're looking for you're a scientist you're looking for knowledge of whatever it is you looking knowledge of whatever it is you looking into if you're a historian looking for into if you're a historian looking for knowledge of the past philosophy knowledge of the past philosophy interested in what is knowledge in interested in what is knowledge in general it's the most general questions general it's the most general questions so actually the philosophy has his so actually the philosophy has his reputation for being very technical reputation for being very technical narrow Etc it's actually about things in narrow Etc it's actually about things in the most General sense and therefore I the most General sense and therefore I think if you got a kind of philosophical think if you got a kind of philosophical training you you you should perhaps be training you you you should perhaps be as equipped as anyone to try and join as equipped as anyone to try and join the dots on this incredibly difficult the dots on this incredibly difficult food system where there are lots of food system where there are lots of experts in all the different parts of it experts in all the different parts of it but there's no one who's expert in that but there's no one who's expert in that narrow technical sense who could bring narrow technical sense who could bring it all together so that's what I'm it all together so that's what I'm trying to do so that's what philosophy trying to do so that's what philosophy is doing the result is a philosophy in a is doing the result is a philosophy in a different meaning of the term now a different meaning of the term now a philosophy for my purposes I'm I I'm philosophy for my purposes I'm I I'm saying it's different to kind of like an saying it's different to kind of like an ideology whatever it might be an ideology whatever it might be an ideology is a quite specific set of kind ideology is a quite specific set of kind of ideas about how things should be the of ideas about how things should be the kind of philosophy I'm trying to get is kind of philosophy I'm trying to get is a very general set of principles now a very general set of principles now this is its both strength and its this is its both strength and its weakness right and so this relates to weakness right and so this relates to what do we do do about it because as a what do we do do about it because as a philosopher trying to have a philosophy philosopher trying to have a philosophy of food it's not for me to sort of like of food it's not for me to sort of like set down exactly how these principles set down exactly how these principles should be followed right it's for people should be followed right it's for people who know more about the particular areas who know more about the particular areas of the food system to judge that I mean of the food system to judge that I mean I have some hunches and all that kind of I have some hunches and all that kind of thing but it's saying one of the most thing but it's saying one of the most general principles that we should all be general principles that we should all be following it should be it should be following it should be shaping our governance of the food shaping our governance of the food system or the way we run the food system system or the way we run the food system and I think in the end the seven and I think in the end the seven principles are come up with what I found principles are come up with what I found quite interesting about them is that quite interesting about them is that actually I think you'd be hard pressed actually I think you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them to be honest and to disagree with them to be honest and you might think that makes it weak you you might think that makes it weak you know anything that's hard to disagree know anything that's hard to disagree with is probably going to be you might with is probably going to be you might think a bit flabby vague or general but think a bit flabby vague or general but what I think is powerful about it is what I think is powerful about it is that if you look at the way the food that if you look at the way the food system is now it is very evidently the system is now it is very evidently the case that it is not in concordance with case that it is not in concordance with these principles so I think going back these principles so I think going back to the alter the my cause for optimism to the alter the my cause for optimism is that I think almost everyone will is that I think almost everyone will agree on the principles and almost agree on the principles and almost everyone who's informed will have to everyone who's informed will have to agree these princi principles are not agree these princi principles are not being followed in our food system being followed in our food system therefore that gives us a common sort of therefore that gives us a common sort of motivation to do something about it now motivation to do something about it now then you say who is the philosophy for then you say who is the philosophy for well it is it is for everyone but there well it is it is for everyone but there are different sort of levels right as are different sort of levels right as individuals I think individuals I think the you do the right thing because it's the you do the right thing because it's the right thing to do not because that's the right thing to do not because that's going to change the world I think this going to change the world I think this is really quite important right because is really quite important right because I think there's this sort of myth that I think there's this sort of myth that has been perpetuated it's ironic really has been perpetuated it's ironic really that you know a lot of people who sort that you know a lot of people who sort of are generally anti-consumerist anti- of are generally anti-consumerist anti- the the you know even anti- capitalist the the you know even anti- capitalist use that horribly crude term um end up use that horribly crude term um end up buying into the idea that the way to buying into the idea that the way to change change the system is by our change change the system is by our shopping choices you know Shop Your Way shopping choices you know Shop Your Way to a better world so it's all about you to a better world so it's all about you know I I say everyone in this room go know I I say everyone in this room go home and check the labels of everything home and check the labels of everything you buy and buy the right thing I think you buy and buy the right thing I think you should do that but only because as a you should do that but only because as a decent person you want to do the good decent person you want to do the good thing you shouldn't do that with the thing you shouldn't do that with the illusion that's going to change the illusion that's going to change the world I mean people have been doing this world I mean people have been doing this ethical shopping for decades and sure ethical shopping for decades and sure gradually gradually certain things have gradually gradually certain things have spread certain that have been knock on spread certain that have been knock on effects but it's not transformational to effects but it's not transformational to transform the system we need to operate transform the system we need to operate at higher levels now um the at higher levels now um the international transnational environment international transnational environment is interesting um I I had when I did the is interesting um I I had when I did the chapter on on governance I I was a bit chapter on on governance I I was a bit afraid people would find it terribly afraid people would find it terribly boring you know the WTO in the General boring you know the WTO in the General agreement on trade and tariffs it agreement on trade and tariffs it doesn't sound very exciting but actually doesn't sound very exciting but actually it's really interesting and very it's really interesting and very important and what I think we're seeing important and what I think we're seeing now is a lot of people have been very now is a lot of people have been very skeptical of things like the World Trade skeptical of things like the World Trade Organization they think it's basically Organization they think it's basically the way in which Rich Nations bully poor the way in which Rich Nations bully poor Nations it doesn't really serve them I Nations it doesn't really serve them I think what we're seeing now is the real think what we're seeing now is the real value of it because what's happening now value of it because what's happening now is you've got people like Trump who are is you've got people like Trump who are trying to tear up the international rule trying to tear up the international rule book and why are they trying to tear out book and why are they trying to tear out the international rule book is to push the international rule book is to push their own interests more aggressively their own interests more aggressively than they allowed to do so under rules than they allowed to do so under rules of things like the World Trade of things like the World Trade Organization the WTO has Organization the WTO has generally helped open up markets in in generally helped open up markets in in developing countries it's made it harder developing countries it's made it harder for rich countries to dump their for rich countries to dump their surpluses on on developing countries uh surpluses on on developing countries uh destroying their own uh systems etc etc destroying their own uh systems etc etc so it's absolutely far from perfect but so it's absolutely far from perfect but it's like you know I think see now how it's like you know I think see now how worse it will be when the international worse it will be when the international rule book is is thrown apart rule book is is thrown apart and and you know Trump just goes for his and and you know Trump just goes for his kind of uh kind of uh transactional uh America First approach transactional uh America First approach and other countries uh follow suit so we and other countries uh follow suit so we we do the the international environment we do the the international environment is important obviously influencing that is important obviously influencing that is very very very difficult as an is very very very difficult as an individual it might seem to be hopeless individual it might seem to be hopeless you know unless you actually get very you know unless you actually get very involved with it as an activist the mo involved with it as an activist the mo the most you can do really is as a the most you can do really is as a citizen try to ensure this is a citizen try to ensure this is a political issue so I'm very much in political issue so I'm very much in favor of people trying to you know we favor of people trying to you know we need to Signal this people are when need to Signal this people are when people vote in elections uh the food people vote in elections uh the food system doesn't come very high at all in system doesn't come very high at all in in their list of priorities but what I in their list of priorities but what I think where I think there's greatest think where I think there's greatest potential for individuals to to do potential for individuals to to do something is well first of all you know something is well first of all you know always with others as literally as an always with others as literally as an individual you can can't achieve very individual you can can't achieve very much but you can work with other much but you can work with other like-minded individuals and I think like-minded individuals and I think there were lots of opportunities to there were lots of opportunities to shift things at institutional levels shift things at institutional levels which are not not necessarily the nation which are not not necessarily the nation not necessarily International but for not necessarily International but for example you're a member of a club right example you're a member of a club right the conduit Club well the the conduit the conduit Club well the the conduit Club is actually a fairly major Club is actually a fairly major purchaser of food and drink it it you purchaser of food and drink it it you right okay so when the if the membership right okay so when the if the membership of the club and I think it does have of the club and I think it does have quite good policies I understand I don't quite good policies I understand I don't know but you know if if the membership know but you know if if the membership of the club make it clear that it's a of the club make it clear that it's a priority that they want sustainable good priority that they want sustainable good fair food and you know food where the fair food and you know food where the producers are paid well then the club as producers are paid well then the club as a buyer makes those differences schools a buyer makes those differences schools schools are very very hamstrung because schools are very very hamstrung because they haven't got a lot of money but they haven't got a lot of money but again with will you can push schools again with will you can push schools education systems local authorities some education systems local authorities some local authorities are shifting for local authorities are shifting for example to um making decisions around example to um making decisions around their going much more plant plant-based their going much more plant plant-based plant Centric so where there's a lot of plant Centric so where there's a lot of opportunity for change I think is to opportunity for change I think is to work together with like-minded people to work together with like-minded people to try and shift the try and shift the institutions uh because you know there's institutions uh because you know there's a heck of a lot of of power purchasing a heck of a lot of of power purchasing power public power public power public procurement you think hospitals schools procurement you think hospitals schools etc etc they buy a heck of a lot of food etc etc they buy a heck of a lot of food and if these things can be put in the and if these things can be put in the right direction that's helpful and it right direction that's helpful and it also has knock on effects because it also has knock on effects because it affects behavior in other ways so for affects behavior in other ways so for example if you go to a Works canteen example if you go to a Works canteen right if you go to a Works canteen right if you go to a Works canteen typically what you'll see is you'll get typically what you'll see is you'll get all the meat stuff and you have the all the meat stuff and you have the vegetable vegetarian option which is vegetable vegetarian option which is usually rubbish I don't know maybe it's usually rubbish I don't know maybe it's improved now it's probably has improved improved now it's probably has improved but it's sort of it's magn find that but it's sort of it's magn find that idea that you know meat is the main idea that you know meat is the main thing veggies is the alternative if you thing veggies is the alternative if you go to a Works canteen where actually go to a Works canteen where actually they just shifted things around and they just shifted things around and there isn't that kind of Stark there isn't that kind of Stark difference between the meat option the difference between the meat option the vegetarian option basically there's a vegetarian option basically there's a lot more vegetables everywhere there's a lot more vegetables everywhere there's a bit of meat if you want it etc etc it it bit of meat if you want it etc etc it it models and normalizes a different way of models and normalizes a different way of thinking about food which then people thinking about food which then people can kind of like influences the way they can kind of like influences the way they eat outside of the workplace etc etc so eat outside of the workplace etc etc so I I don't know I I think that for most I I don't know I I think that for most people uh the the biggest levers for people uh the the biggest levers for change they've got are to try and change they've got are to try and influence the institutions closest to influence the institutions closest to them which they have interest in um but them which they have interest in um but I don't know what I mean you're you're I don't know what I mean you're you're you're you've been a campaigner and you're you've been a campaigner and you're a professional campaigner so I you're a professional campaigner so I don't know what you think about this I I don't know what you think about this I I really I don't want to force you to really I don't want to force you to speak too much but I'd love to know what speak too much but I'd love to know what you you you think well I many of the words I've just think well I many of the words I've just heard you spoke are words that I would heard you spoke are words that I would speak myself that thing about well you speak myself that thing about well you know you you you do what's right because know you you you do what's right because it's right you help an old person across it's right you help an old person across the street the street the street not with the expectation that doing so not with the expectation that doing so is going to create World Peace but is going to create World Peace but because we all want to do be nice to because we all want to do be nice to people people people um but putting your faith in those um but putting your faith in those individual acts um as a as a way of individual acts um as a as a way of transforming the system is is is transforming the system is is is insufficient um but yeah no I I was insufficient um but yeah no I I was highlighting that I I do I do believe highlighting that I I do I do believe that the layer of governance that is that the layer of governance that is weakest but needs to be stronger if weakest but needs to be stronger if we're going to tackle Global problems is we're going to tackle Global problems is is at the global governance level and is at the global governance level and whilst we have the WTO and we have the whilst we have the WTO and we have the United Nations we don't have anything United Nations we don't have anything where we together as humans can where we together as humans can democratically decide on anything as democratically decide on anything as peers with our brothers and sisters and peers with our brothers and sisters and everyone else in all the other parts of everyone else in all the other parts of the world we're locked into these silos the world we're locked into these silos called countries and we don't have any called countries and we don't have any means of co- deciding and I think the means of co- deciding and I think the creation of a Global Commons that is run creation of a Global Commons that is run democratically through democracy is democratically through democracy is probably the single best next biggest probably the single best next biggest evolutionary step for all forms of evolutionary step for all forms of global governance whether it's climate global governance whether it's climate whether it's managing the Global Commons whether it's managing the Global Commons like the Seas the atmosphere the air all like the Seas the atmosphere the air all of these these Global Commons are of these these Global Commons are currently currently currently being well colonized essentially by being well colonized essentially by private interests and by nation states private interests and by nation states who have a vested interest in who have a vested interest in perpetuating the tragedy of the commons perpetuating the tragedy of the commons they don't have a mechanism to represent they don't have a mechanism to represent the common good um and all of our the common good um and all of our political power is political power is is it's not all of it but our the vast is it's not all of it but our the vast majority of the power in the world is majority of the power in the world is focused into institutions that do not focused into institutions that do not have the job description of looking have the job description of looking after the common good and I think that's after the common good and I think that's that is the single biggest problem we that is the single biggest problem we have politically as individual agents have politically as individual agents and as you know Global and as you know Global Citizens Citizens Citizens um um um and feeling positive about that is the and feeling positive about that is the lifelong struggle and um you know I've lifelong struggle and um you know I've I've kept myself going as an activist as I've kept myself going as an activist as Julian says as an entrepreneur as a as a Julian says as an entrepreneur as a as a practitioner a grower an Eater of food practitioner a grower an Eater of food by really um you know focusing on by really um you know focusing on companionship and remembering that we companionship and remembering that we we've got to make this Global we've got to make this Global transformation fun we've got to make it transformation fun we've got to make it delicious we' got to make sure that at delicious we' got to make sure that at our parties we have the best food the our parties we have the best food the best people the best drink I'm I'm the best people the best drink I'm I'm the biggest party because if you want to biggest party because if you want to change the world you've got to get change the world you've got to get people to leave their party and come to people to leave their party and come to ours instead that's how we're going to ours instead that's how we're going to transform the world through positive transform the world through positive visioning and and taking action that visioning and and taking action that inspires and moves the human heart inspires and moves the human heart because there are some pretty colossal because there are some pretty colossal vested interests you know if you look at vested interests you know if you look at the corporate interests that have the corporate interests that have absolutely no interest in preserving the absolutely no interest in preserving the launch over to the Amazon and rainforest launch over to the Amazon and rainforest it makes total sense economically still it makes total sense economically still for large corporations to turn Forest for large corporations to turn Forest into toilet paper and and and make into toilet paper and and and make profit because profit is the driver not profit because profit is the driver not food production not long-term food production not long-term sustainability profit accumulation of sustainability profit accumulation of vast amounts of profit that is vast amounts of profit that is increasingly held in very small number increasingly held in very small number of hands of hands of hands and and and um that is that's a huge um that is that's a huge bulldozer that we're up against and it bulldozer that we're up against and it is the dominant force in the world's is the dominant force in the world's food system the generation of food system the generation of profit but on the other side we have 8 profit but on the other side we have 8 billion human hearts every single one of billion human hearts every single one of which is hardwired for companionship for which is hardwired for companionship for connecting with each other and connecting with each other and connecting with Mother Earth and every connecting with Mother Earth and every single one of us I believe inherently single one of us I believe inherently loves nature and loves the flow of that loves nature and loves the flow of that connectivity between us and all other connectivity between us and all other life forms life forms life forms and therein and through the way in which and therein and through the way in which we can show kind of share food therein we can show kind of share food therein lies that thread of what could be called lies that thread of what could be called optimism and I think maybe julan before optimism and I think maybe julan before we open it up for the audience and give we open it up for the audience and give them a flavor because we did promise them a flavor because we did promise lots of time we started a little bit lots of time we started a little bit late and I don't know whether that means late and I don't know whether that means we go on Beyond 7:30 or whether we have we go on Beyond 7:30 or whether we have a oh it's a hard stop in that case I'm a oh it's a hard stop in that case I'm going to have to ask you to be quite going to have to ask you to be quite brief to give them more time but perhaps brief to give them more time but perhaps you can def fine you can def fine first I so I want you to answer the first I so I want you to answer the question are you an optimist or a question are you an optimist or a pessimist but before that you need to pessimist but before that you need to Define Define Define optimism and Define what it is you're optimism and Define what it is you're being optimistic about and then tell us being optimistic about and then tell us which you are if all do it in another which you are if all do it in another way but yeah okay that would tickle me way but yeah okay that would tickle me I'm actually really interested in the I'm actually really interested in the question of optimism pessimism actually question of optimism pessimism actually working on on something at the moment working on on something at the moment because it's interesting if you read because it's interesting if you read sort of popular psychology um there is sort of popular psychology um there is something things which you talked about something things which you talked about um the optimism bias that human beings um the optimism bias that human beings are naturally optimistic and others talk are naturally optimistic and others talk about this one the negativity effect about this one the negativity effect that we always sort of like expect the that we always sort of like expect the worst so it see it seems to be worst so it see it seems to be contradictory I I got to dig away at it contradictory I I got to dig away at it I think one of the key issues is that um I think one of the key issues is that um it's one of these things again going it's one of these things again going back to almost the first thing we talked back to almost the first thing we talked about we like to see the world in neat about we like to see the world in neat binaries and we like think oh optimism binaries and we like think oh optimism and pessimism it's really and pessimism it's really straightforward I think that it's just straightforward I think that it's just far more nuanced than that any far more nuanced than that any individual is probably going to be individual is probably going to be optimistic about some things and optimistic about some things and pessimistic about others whether we call pessimistic about others whether we call them a pessimist or an optimist depends them a pessimist or an optimist depends on whether they tend more towards the on whether they tend more towards the pessimistic stuff than the optimistic pessimistic stuff than the optimistic stuff but everyone's more complicated stuff but everyone's more complicated than that now actually if we take than that now actually if we take optimism in its usual definition so T optimism in its usual definition so T sherro who's a psychologist wrote the sherro who's a psychologist wrote the book The optimism bias she defines it book The optimism bias she defines it pretty much as the belief you know pretty much as the belief you know independent of the evidence that things independent of the evidence that things will generally work out for for the best will generally work out for for the best or for the better right so it's the or for the better right so it's the expectations that things will be better expectations that things will be better in be better than they would on average in be better than they would on average typically be right so it is by typically be right so it is by definition a overly Rosy view of the definition a overly Rosy view of the future that kind of optimism I don't future that kind of optimism I don't think one could sort of rationally uh think one could sort of rationally uh will to be but I think I mean I actually will to be but I think I mean I actually sort of like to go back to Jean Paul SRA sort of like to go back to Jean Paul SRA on this right Jean Paul SRA said and and on this right Jean Paul SRA said and and don't shoot me for saying we should live don't shoot me for saying we should live without hope right and I I think he's without hope right and I I think he's right in a way but he's doing that right in a way but he's doing that sneaky thing he's saying something which sneaky thing he's saying something which doesn't mean what it seems to mean when doesn't mean what it seems to mean when he says we should live without hope what he says we should live without hope what we means is we should not live with the we means is we should not live with the kind of Illusion the conviction based on kind of Illusion the conviction based on no reason at all that things will work no reason at all that things will work out for the best we should not work with out for the best we should not work with a conviction that the people who work a conviction that the people who work with us will stick Byers they will with us will stick Byers they will continue our work if we give up etc etc continue our work if we give up etc etc so when he says live without hope what so when he says live without hope what he really means is don't live with this he really means is don't live with this sort of naive expectation everything sort of naive expectation everything will work out for the best but he says will work out for the best but he says that is no reason to slip into I ISM and that is no reason to slip into I ISM and doing nothing what we ought to do is we doing nothing what we ought to do is we ought to live in a way where we are ought to live in a way where we are working for what most matters now going working for what most matters now going Beyond such I think that one has to Beyond such I think that one has to believe in the possibility of success believe in the possibility of success but one doesn't need to have any strong but one doesn't need to have any strong views about How likely that is in fact views about How likely that is in fact we should probably just embrace the fact we should probably just embrace the fact that the world is much more uncertain that the world is much more uncertain than we' like it to be no one really than we' like it to be no one really knows The Optimist is guilty of of knows The Optimist is guilty of of making assumptions uh that are making assumptions uh that are unwarranted about how good they will be unwarranted about how good they will be with the pessimist is is the opposite so with the pessimist is is the opposite so I have this issue you know when people I have this issue you know when people talk about is the world going to pot is talk about is the world going to pot is everything going downhill at the moment everything going downhill at the moment it does seem to be going that way it does seem to be going that way doesn't it but I think that you know if doesn't it but I think that you know if you take the long-term long-term view you take the long-term long-term view there's no more reason to think that the there's no more reason to think that the the Earth is we are completely doomed as the Earth is we are completely doomed as it is to think we're all going to be it is to think we're all going to be okay it's hugely uncertain the important okay it's hugely uncertain the important thing is to work for what the best thing is to work for what the best outcome might be so am I not tost or outcome might be so am I not tost or pessimist I I i' let me reject those pessimist I I i' let me reject those terms I think I'm someone who believes terms I think I'm someone who believes it is important to and it is worth it is important to and it is worth working for what is good in the belief working for what is good in the belief that it could happen and it's certainly that it could happen and it's certainly not going to happen if we don't do it not going to happen if we don't do it let's put it that way and in a way let's put it that way and in a way whether we succeed or not is is out of whether we succeed or not is is out of our control we can't make that the key our control we can't make that the key thing and there's this idea that um well thing and there's this idea that um well actually I'm not going to say talking actually I'm not going to say talking don't know talking and I don't know if don't know talking and I don't know if this is a correct thing you know there this is a correct thing you know there is an idea that it's worth working for is an idea that it's worth working for the best thing even even if um it the best thing even even if um it doesn't work out in the end right you doesn't work out in the end right you know you don't you you to to to to work know you don't you you to to to to work for what is right isn't premised on the for what is right isn't premised on the idea that you're going to be the Victor idea that you're going to be the Victor you're working for what is right because you're working for what is right because it is right and if you lose you want to it is right and if you lose you want to be on the losing team having fought the be on the losing team having fought the good fight you don't want to be on the good fight you don't want to be on the winning team when the winning team is winning team when the winning team is you know the forces of Satan whatever it you know the forces of Satan whatever it might be so so you don't even have to might be so so you don't even have to think you could you could think we are think you could you could think we are doomed it's still would mean it's worth doomed it's still would mean it's worth working for what is good but I think working for what is good but I think there's a possibility there's real there's a possibility there's real possibility of a much better F future possibility of a much better F future for our food system I think we should for our food system I think we should work for it we just we don't need to to work for it we just we don't need to to we don't need to have in our heads a we don't need to have in our heads a firm idea whether we're going to succeed firm idea whether we're going to succeed or not to do it I like to think to to or not to do it I like to think to to answer that and to fully agree um it's answer that and to fully agree um it's almost like there's an inverse almost like there's an inverse proportion relationship between um the proportion relationship between um the effort with which we might go at effort with which we might go at something like saving the food system in something like saving the food system in the planet um and its likelihood of the planet um and its likelihood of success if I if we all knew it was success if I if we all knew it was 99.9% likely that planet Earth was going 99.9% likely that planet Earth was going to be totally fine no one's going to die to be totally fine no one's going to die of starvation species are going to stop of starvation species are going to stop going extinct we can all sit back and going extinct we can all sit back and relax it's going to be fine if we've got relax it's going to be fine if we've got 0.1% chance that that's the case and 0.1% chance that that's the case and 99.9% chance that actually the vast 99.9% chance that actually the vast majority of species on Earth are going majority of species on Earth are going to go extinct by the end of the century to go extinct by the end of the century and at least a couple of billion people and at least a couple of billion people are going to suffer extremely um extreme are going to suffer extremely um extreme privation on a you know basic human privation on a you know basic human needs needs needs level um then it requires all of us to level um then it requires all of us to be up on our feet doing absolutely be up on our feet doing absolutely everything we possibly can every single everything we possibly can every single day and passionately engaging in it and day and passionately engaging in it and and you know that that the lower the and you know that that the lower the likelihood of success the likelihood of success the more reason for us to be motivated to do more reason for us to be motivated to do something about it and then is the fail something about it and then is the fail safe just we got to make sure we've had safe just we got to make sure we've had a good time while we do it it's why a good time while we do it it's why feasting and partying is so important feasting and partying is so important because if we're going to fail we're because if we're going to fail we're going to get to end of our lives at going to get to end of our lives at least we can look back and said that was least we can look back and said that was orgiastic that fight that we fought was orgiastic that fight that we fought was the place to be and on that note opening the place to be and on that note opening up to the audience um and thank you for up to the audience um and thank you for being compassionate Auditors um we want being compassionate Auditors um we want all kinds of comment all kinds of all kinds of comment all kinds of discussion and um there is going to be a discussion and um there is going to be a roving mic so that we can all hear each roving mic so that we can all hear each other over to you make it as concise as other over to you make it as concise as you can I think K is coming first right you can I think K is coming first right um I think K is going to speak first um I think K is going to speak first Chris yeah thank you um I had a question Chris yeah thank you um I had a question from the community um and my question is from the community um and my question is which countries or country are best which countries or country are best placed in terms of food security and placed in terms of food security and which are most at risk which are most at risk that's an interesting question you you that's an interesting question you you you might have a different answer you might have a different answer because the these things always um shift because the these things always um shift so there were various different indices so there were various different indices as what how do you measure it right but as what how do you measure it right but in one one of the sort of most I I try in one one of the sort of most I I try to get the most upto-date and best data to get the most upto-date and best data on this and and the one that came um on this and and the one that came um highest for food security was was was highest for food security was was was Finland strangely enough interestingly Finland strangely enough interestingly enough now what's interesting is it enough now what's interesting is it scores very low for scores very low for self-sufficiency right and this is self-sufficiency right and this is really it's a really interesting really it's a really interesting distinction because I think people tend distinction because I think people tend to think uh food security means to think uh food security means self-sufficiency now a a quick way of self-sufficiency now a a quick way of demonstrating why self-sufficiency is demonstrating why self-sufficiency is not the same as food security is this not the same as food security is this let's imagine you got yourself a little let's imagine you got yourself a little small holding and you become 100% small holding and you become 100% self-sufficient how food secure are you self-sufficient how food secure are you the answer is not very because if you the answer is not very because if you have one bad year you get one flood you have one bad year you get one flood you get a wildfire or something all your get a wildfire or something all your food's gone so your your complete food's gone so your your complete self-sufficiency makes you very UNF food self-sufficiency makes you very UNF food secure now on a national on a state secure now on a national on a state level it's not quite as straightforward level it's not quite as straightforward as that but essentially you know there's as that but essentially you know there's a kind of a golden sort of average or a kind of a golden sort of average or there's a golden level where you know there's a golden level where you know people should produce a good quantity of people should produce a good quantity of their own food and we don't I think most their own food and we don't I think most people say the UK doesn't produce enough people say the UK doesn't produce enough but you don't want to be entirely but you don't want to be entirely dependent finland's very good on food dependent finland's very good on food security because it does actually security because it does actually protect a lot of its own producers by protect a lot of its own producers by things like thoughtful subsidy Etc the things like thoughtful subsidy Etc the conditions for food growing are not conditions for food growing are not brilliant in Finland if it weren't for brilliant in Finland if it weren't for government incentives then there'd be government incentives then there'd be much less food than there is so the much less food than there is so the government recognizes the fact it needs government recognizes the fact it needs to support its farmers and it does that to support its farmers and it does that but it's also well connected with with but it's also well connected with with Europe which is you know a continent Europe which is you know a continent which which which is touchwood um economically being you is touchwood um economically being you politically fairly stable etc etc politically fairly stable etc etc produces a lot of food so it's actually produces a lot of food so it's actually very good for food food security um but very good for food food security um but these things these things shift so it's these things these things shift so it's one of those things by the time the book one of those things by the time the book comes out it may not be number one I comes out it may not be number one I don't know if you got any any insight don't know if you got any any insight into that that I don't have there well I into that that I don't have there well I have if you don't mind me adding um I have if you don't mind me adding um I think firstly the answers to the think firstly the answers to the questions are really clear um evidence questions are really clear um evidence of the thing that I was saying a second of the thing that I was saying a second ago which is precisely that the nation ago which is precisely that the nation states system as the the deal broker in states system as the the deal broker in this as the lens through which we look this as the lens through which we look at that question which country is the at that question which country is the most food secure when the whole bloody most food secure when the whole bloody point is if we screw the planet there point is if we screw the planet there ain't none of us that are safe so you ain't none of us that are safe so you look at the United States which by look at the United States which by conventional terms has by far the conventional terms has by far the greatest actual and blatant food greatest actual and blatant food surpluses which could be taken as an surpluses which could be taken as an indicator of food security they've got indicator of food security they've got the biggest buffer between them and the biggest buffer between them and hunger if you include both this is a hunger if you include both this is a calculation I did in my book both the calculation I did in my book both the actual food available in the shops and actual food available in the shops and restaurants of the USA it's about twice restaurants of the USA it's about twice as much as what is actually required to as much as what is actually required to um serve the nutritional needs of that um serve the nutritional needs of that population if you include all the grains population if you include all the grains that are being grown and fed to that are being grown and fed to livestock within their system not within livestock within their system not within their country but within their system their country but within their system which includes the imports and which includes the imports and exports of all of those grains that were exports of all of those grains that were grown to feed Liv stock but most of grown to feed Liv stock but most of which was turned into and heat if which was turned into and heat if you include all of that that's what I you include all of that that's what I mean by latent so the kind of hidden mean by latent so the kind of hidden food availability you see what I food availability you see what I mean then it's more than four times the mean then it's more than four times the caloric requ requirements within the US caloric requ requirements within the US system so the buffer is absolutely system so the buffer is absolutely gigantic and for that very reason their gigantic and for that very reason their food system is really insecure because food system is really insecure because it is driving planetary meltdown which it is driving planetary meltdown which is then going to undermine their food is then going to undermine their food system um if you go to a country like system um if you go to a country like Japan by contrast which has comparable Japan by contrast which has comparable wealth less but it's comparable and you wealth less but it's comparable and you look at where their food surplus lies look at where their food surplus lies relative to the US indeed relative to relative to the US indeed relative to almost all other nations of a comparable almost all other nations of a comparable um wealth the Japanese don't overeat to um wealth the Japanese don't overeat to anything like the extent that virtually anything like the extent that virtually any other country of a similar level of any other country of a similar level of asence does they do not waste food to asence does they do not waste food to anything like the extent that any other anything like the extent that any other nation of a comparable wealth do and nation of a comparable wealth do and their food surpluses therefore both their food surpluses therefore both actual and latent are vastly lower than actual and latent are vastly lower than most others and on that parameter they most others and on that parameter they have less security but actually more so have less security but actually more so um yeah that very lens is the reason why um yeah that very lens is the reason why we should should um ideally get past the we should should um ideally get past the nation state as our single you know nation state as our single you know biggest lens it's just it's so biggest lens it's just it's so irrelevant the food system by itself is irrelevant the food system by itself is capable indeed you know when Paris capable indeed you know when Paris climate agreement was climate agreement was signed the food system was identified as signed the food system was identified as being if we followed the current being if we followed the current trajectories it's going to take us above trajectories it's going to take us above that level by it self even if we that level by it self even if we achieved 100% green energy transition achieved 100% green energy transition like that um so yeah without sorting the like that um so yeah without sorting the food system all the other things are food system all the other things are going to fall apart all right got a going to fall apart all right got a question right back here thank you um if question right back here thank you um if we look at what Trump's doing he's we look at what Trump's doing he's clearly rolling back protections around clearly rolling back protections around the environment climate change food the environment climate change food standards he's pushing on tariffs um has standards he's pushing on tariffs um has a big Downer on ESG and CSR and all a big Downer on ESG and CSR and all those things what impact do you think those things what impact do you think that his Collective set of policies that his Collective set of policies could have on Global Food Systems around could have on Global Food Systems around the world and food the world and food production oh I I hate to do predictions production oh I I hate to do predictions of this kind of stuff because I'm I'm of this kind of stuff because I'm I'm really not very good at it I really not very good at it I mean I I suppose I would not want to mean I I suppose I would not want to totally despair although you know I totally despair although you know I remember Trump's first term by the way I remember Trump's first term by the way I I I have to say in an audience it's I I have to say in an audience it's always easy to assume that everyone uh always easy to assume that everyone uh LOE Trump and they don't and I'm sure LOE Trump and they don't and I'm sure there probably some people this who there probably some people this who support him and I I don't want you to support him and I I don't want you to feel like you know you're you're Pari feel like you know you're you're Pari and do speak up you want to say and do speak up you want to say something but for someone like myself something but for someone like myself you know every day I woke up during the you know every day I woke up during the first Trump prescy hearing the latest first Trump prescy hearing the latest thing he'd said it was just like oh oh thing he'd said it was just like oh oh we go and this time it's like on on we go and this time it's like on on steroids the reason it might not be as steroids the reason it might not be as bad as it seems is well you know it is bad as it seems is well you know it is one country and um at the end of the day one country and um at the end of the day human beings don't sort of transform human beings don't sort of transform overnight so for example on energy overnight so for example on energy there's lots of reasons to suggest that there's lots of reasons to suggest that he's got a drill baby drill thing it's he's got a drill baby drill thing it's not going to be very good but but not going to be very good but but actually because Renewables are becoming actually because Renewables are becoming so competitive on price that's where the so competitive on price that's where the future's going to go anyway right so future's going to go anyway right so he's he's going to kind of be a bit of a he's he's going to kind of be a bit of a spoiler on it but the the the the the spoiler on it but the the the the the good hard economic reasons for for going good hard economic reasons for for going to Renewables are so strong that he's to Renewables are so strong that he's not going to totally derail that he's not going to totally derail that he's just going to mess with it a bit Food just going to mess with it a bit Food Systems is trickier but I guess again Systems is trickier but I guess again this is just pure speculation from my this is just pure speculation from my point of view but if you got someone if point of view but if you got someone if is trying to like smash things up etc is trying to like smash things up etc etc it's possible that in response to etc it's possible that in response to that things like the European Union Etc that things like the European Union Etc are going to sort of assert their own are going to sort of assert their own principles a bit more strongly we have principles a bit more strongly we have we could get fewer American Imports you we could get fewer American Imports you know it very much depends how other know it very much depends how other nations react to it but any I shouldn't nations react to it but any I shouldn't say more because frankly I'm I'm not I'm say more because frankly I'm I'm not I'm not a geopolitical analyst so I I'm not not a geopolitical analyst so I I'm not I'm not sure well it's a bit like the I'm not sure well it's a bit like the alien thread you know what's the most alien thread you know what's the most likely thing that could bring about the likely thing that could bring about the kind of global cohesion around saving kind of global cohesion around saving the planet of anything well it's been an the planet of anything well it's been an alien enemy coming in that we can all alien enemy coming in that we can all unite against and maybe try will serve unite against and maybe try will serve um the rest of the planet that great um the rest of the planet that great service and at least what I would say is service and at least what I would say is um let's focus on on doing that in so um let's focus on on doing that in so far as we can and just on a far as we can and just on a temperamental temperamental temperamental level I think Trump level I think Trump and his ilk what they most want is for and his ilk what they most want is for us to talk about them talk about all the us to talk about them talk about all the outrageous things they've done that's outrageous things they've done that's their strategy and the more oxygen we their strategy and the more oxygen we can suck out of that the better can suck out of that the better we have a question back we have a question back here hi there um thanks been very here hi there um thanks been very enjoyable conversation so I would like enjoyable conversation so I would like to ask a s of two-prong question if I to ask a s of two-prong question if I may one is Technical and uh I haven't may one is Technical and uh I haven't read your your book but uh I have read read your your book but uh I have read Charlie man's book The Wizard and the Charlie man's book The Wizard and the prophet about V and Boro um in terms of prophet about V and Boro um in terms of the uh traditional food production the uh traditional food production versus industrial food production and uh versus industrial food production and uh I'd be interested to know if you I'd be interested to know if you consider that in the re resarch you did consider that in the re resarch you did for the book um and what I don't think I for the book um and what I don't think I heard discussed so far tonight is the heard discussed so far tonight is the interaction between the expected climate interaction between the expected climate change that we've got baked in you know change that we've got baked in you know we're already at one and a half there's we're already at one and a half there's a debate as so where we're going to go a debate as so where we're going to go but that's definitely going to have an but that's definitely going to have an impact on on food production um and the impact on on food production um and the expected population increase so that's expected population increase so that's sort of D know sort of complex sort of D know sort of complex interaction between those the other interaction between those the other question or the related question but a question or the related question but a different spectrum is a cultural different spectrum is a cultural question U I'm Irish you might pick up question U I'm Irish you might pick up from my accent um our version of the from my accent um our version of the Iliad is called the tonbo kulina which Iliad is called the tonbo kulina which is the cattle raate of koui uh it's is the cattle raate of koui uh it's deeply ingrained in our culture that you deeply ingrained in our culture that you your wealth was measured by your number your wealth was measured by your number of cattle that you had and we sort of of cattle that you had and we sort of went to battle over stealing each went to battle over stealing each other's cattle and all that kind of other's cattle and all that kind of stuff and and and that's applicated in stuff and and and that's applicated in other cultures around the world um and other cultures around the world um and so there's a very sort of great Affinity so there's a very sort of great Affinity to to eating meat and cattl and beef in to to eating meat and cattl and beef in particular um I guess I think in the particular um I guess I think in the joke the the uh Great Big Fat Greek joke the the uh Great Big Fat Greek Wedding is it when the guy comes home Wedding is it when the guy comes home and she says he's vegetarian she says oh and she says he's vegetarian she says oh that's fine you'll have lamb you know that's fine you'll have lamb you know that um and so uh it's interesting that that um and so uh it's interesting that in context with the I mean the Irish in context with the I mean the Irish beef industry is a massive Lobby is very beef industry is a massive Lobby is very powerful uh you know environmental laws powerful uh you know environmental laws are relaxed for them labor laws are are relaxed for them labor laws are relaxed for them uh incredibly powerful relaxed for them uh incredibly powerful and so um that sort of uh cultural and so um that sort of uh cultural aspect of it and then how it gets sort aspect of it and then how it gets sort of abused by industry that interaction of abused by industry that interaction be interested to hear you speak about be interested to hear you speak about that as well if you don't mind okay that as well if you don't mind okay thanks so um thanks so um so I'm going to say something about the so I'm going to say something about the first thing I've I've forgotten so after first thing I've I've forgotten so after you talk about the wizard or the you talk about the wizard or the whatever you talked about the um the whatever you talked about the um the first part of the question was inter first part of the question was inter climate change and population oh climate climate change and population oh climate change and population yeah okay thank change and population yeah okay thank you yeah no population is a very very you yeah no population is a very very climate change is obviously the main climate change is obviously the main problem with climate change is going to problem with climate change is going to be very very disruptive um and it's be very very disruptive um and it's going to S disrupt crop production and going to S disrupt crop production and everything I mean you know it's always everything I mean you know it's always possible of course that you know people possible of course that you know people The Optimist say oh it's going to open The Optimist say oh it's going to open up Farmland in the north etc etc but the up Farmland in the north etc etc but the point is that um well water is going to point is that um well water is going to be more more water stress it's bound to be more more water stress it's bound to be a problem but to be honest I think be a problem but to be honest I think you know climate change and population you know climate change and population needn't be the great disasters that some needn't be the great disasters that some people fear and population is the big people fear and population is the big one population is going to Plateau one population is going to Plateau sometime in the and and every time they sometime in the and and every time they do the uh projections uh the date of do the uh projections uh the date of that Plateau comes forward um not not that Plateau comes forward um not not back you know um and so it is going to back you know um and so it is going to happen but the point is this that uh we happen but the point is this that uh we already produce uh you know more already produce uh you know more calories per person than there are calories per person than there are people in the world right and there's no people in the world right and there's no reason at all why we can't feed even the reason at all why we can't feed even the growing population the problem with the growing population the problem with the growing population is is not population growing population is is not population per se it's what that population are per se it's what that population are eating and basically as particularly as eating and basically as particularly as Nations become richer they want to eat Nations become richer they want to eat more meat and dairy and all these kind more meat and dairy and all these kind of things that's what's putting the huge of things that's what's putting the huge strain on the food system right so if strain on the food system right so if you got the so the eat lanet report you got the so the eat lanet report which sort of like was the most which sort of like was the most authoritative um Research into this authoritative um Research into this trying to come up with a diet that was trying to come up with a diet that was both sustainable for the planet and both sustainable for the planet and healthy you know came up and it relates healthy you know came up and it relates to your second Point neatly it came up to your second Point neatly it came up with uh yes this recommendation that with uh yes this recommendation that essentially there has to be a lot less essentially there has to be a lot less meat eating in industrialized nations in meat eating in industrialized nations in some parts of the world there should be some parts of the world there should be more some people don't get enough animal more some people don't get enough animal protein they should get a bit more protein they should get a bit more overall you're going to see a decrease overall you're going to see a decrease and a very big decrease in and a very big decrease in industrialized nations but to be honest industrialized nations but to be honest that's not catastrophic I looked at that's not catastrophic I looked at their their their recommendations uh which all the recommendations uh which all the headlines said you're massively slashing headlines said you're massively slashing I do eat meat but not a lot and I looked I do eat meat but not a lot and I looked at it and I'm I'm basically fine I'm at it and I'm I'm basically fine I'm within their recommendations already I within their recommendations already I don't even I'm not an Eco Warrior or don't even I'm not an Eco Warrior or anything I just don't eat that much meat anything I just don't eat that much meat um but the other important thing about um but the other important thing about this is that the eat l City commission this is that the eat l City commission was very very sensitive to the fact that was very very sensitive to the fact that you know it was a pluralist report it you know it was a pluralist report it accepted the fact that what people eat accepted the fact that what people eat is going to depend a lot on the kind of is going to depend a lot on the kind of conditions of their land and their conditions of their land and their climate and also their culture and climate and also their culture and traditions so for each kind of food traditions so for each kind of food stuff it gave a range in a country like stuff it gave a range in a country like Ireland you would expect people to eat Ireland you would expect people to eat more beef and butter than the uh global more beef and butter than the uh global average because you've got the land for average because you've got the land for it and you got the tra tradition for it it and you got the tra tradition for it right in places like Japan people going right in places like Japan people going to eat a lot more Seafood they're not to eat a lot more Seafood they're not have so much of the cattle etc etc so so have so much of the cattle etc etc so so I think we have we have to this is why I think we have we have to this is why the one size fits all doesn't work work the one size fits all doesn't work work right um but I think relating to your right um but I think relating to your second Point as well the thing about the second Point as well the thing about the culture is the in food culture and culture is the in food culture and history it is often kind of like history it is often kind of like weaponized um to use that horrible word weaponized um to use that horrible word in ways which are not true to what's in ways which are not true to what's actually going on um the food tradition actually going on um the food tradition becomes a kind of collective myth and becomes a kind of collective myth and the myth does not match the reality so the myth does not match the reality so for example France I think it's probably for example France I think it's probably still it is true that in France you can still it is true that in France you can get a better quality produce in the get a better quality produce in the supermarkets the the the things of Al supermarkets the the the things of Al life but you must not romanticize it life but you must not romanticize it they're the biggest market for MCD they they're the biggest market for MCD they were at least the biggest market for were at least the biggest market for McDonald's outside of America they eat McDonald's outside of America they eat lots of fast food etc etc the French lots of fast food etc etc the French have this mythology of their great food have this mythology of their great food culture and it allows them to sort of culture and it allows them to sort of like not notice all the ways in which like not notice all the ways in which they're actually doing a lot of things they're actually doing a lot of things the rest of the world is doing and in the rest of the world is doing and in Ireland right okay you talk about the Ireland right okay you talk about the beef industry lobbying well I don't know beef industry lobbying well I don't know what it's like there but let's take what it's like there but let's take Argentina Argentina has got this big Argentina Argentina has got this big beef um culture right but the fact of beef um culture right but the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the matter is that the vast majority of meat beef production in Argentina now meat beef production in Argentina now has got nothing to do with that long has got nothing to do with that long tradition of the Pampers and the tradition of the Pampers and the extensive grazing it's feed Lots on corn extensive grazing it's feed Lots on corn and soy so the people are using that oh and soy so the people are using that oh we're argentinians we like our beef it's we're argentinians we like our beef it's traditional to justify a method of traditional to justify a method of producing beef which has got nothing to producing beef which has got nothing to do with tradition whatsoever so I think do with tradition whatsoever so I think you know people got to be Savvy about you know people got to be Savvy about this I think you want to stand up for this I think you want to stand up for the um the Irish right in Tradition you the um the Irish right in Tradition you the god-given right of every Irish have the god-given right of every Irish have butter and beef um to say yes it's the butter and beef um to say yes it's the god-given right have butter and beef god-given right have butter and beef from cows that are grazing out on your from cows that are grazing out on your wonderful Emerald fields and all that wonderful Emerald fields and all that kind of stuff not have stuff which is kind of stuff not have stuff which is which is grown in in feed Lots etc etc which is grown in in feed Lots etc etc so yeah I think that's so yeah I think that's important to which I will add just a important to which I will add just a very small thing if you don't mind um very small thing if you don't mind um and that is we haven't talked about the and that is we haven't talked about the use of use of use of subsidies in this conversation yet which subsidies in this conversation yet which is an emission because at the moment is an emission because at the moment about $750 billion do at least worth of about $750 billion do at least worth of money globally is spent each year on money globally is spent each year on Farm subsidies this is public money our Farm subsidies this is public money our taxes going to Farmers and at the moment taxes going to Farmers and at the moment around 1% of that goes towards around 1% of that goes towards supporting ecologically sustainable supporting ecologically sustainable farming that is the biggest Mis spending farming that is the biggest Mis spending of public money on the planet and it's of public money on the planet and it's the biggest missed opportunity in trans the biggest missed opportunity in trans forming the food system into one that forming the food system into one that could actually be regenerative on the could actually be regenerative on the world in the world if we use that world in the world if we use that subsidy to pay cattle Farmers to build subsidy to pay cattle Farmers to build our soils replenish aquifers create our soils replenish aquifers create habitats and indeed potentially lower habitats and indeed potentially lower the population of um cattle in Ireland the population of um cattle in Ireland they can they can they can be um Revenue neutral and be doing much be um Revenue neutral and be doing much more good for the planet and the same more good for the planet and the same goes the world over so that that is just goes the world over so that that is just a really important ingredient in the a really important ingredient in the moment those things don't happen because moment those things don't happen because of entrenched interests within the farm of entrenched interests within the farm lobbies of the United States and of lobbies of the United States and of Europe where the two really biggest farm Europe where the two really biggest farm um subsidy budgets exist but therein um subsidy budgets exist but therein breaking that that breaking that that um that those entrenched interests and um that those entrenched interests and breaking through with environmental breaking through with environmental policies to the farmers who currently policies to the farmers who currently massively resist them they've got such a massively resist them they've got such a bad name is is I would say one of the bad name is is I would say one of the biggest if not the biggest thing we need biggest if not the biggest thing we need to focus on from a policy level is is to focus on from a policy level is is being able to bring in agroecological being able to bring in agroecological farm subsidies that don't piss Farmers farm subsidies that don't piss Farmers off as much as the current ones do um off as much as the current ones do um and on that note I think we have to wrap and on
