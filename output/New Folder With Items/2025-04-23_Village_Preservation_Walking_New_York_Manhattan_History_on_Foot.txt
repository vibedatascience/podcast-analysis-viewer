Join us for for a presentation with Keith Taillon as he speaks to us about his newly published book, Walking New York, with a special focus on our neighborhoods. His book explores his most popular walking tour routes, examining in depth the various neighborhoods of Manhattan, their history, and the intricacies of their formation.

He traces the evolution of the Big Apple back to some of its early seeds, focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries—a window in which New York City transformed from a small provincial port town into a global metropolis. Keith covers everything from the completion of the Erie Canal and Croton Aqueduct to some of the notorious characters behind the city’s Gilded Age.

Each chapter of the book features a suggested walking route, with a detailed map and notes on the route’s length and time. Throughout each walk, readers are encouraged to pause and absorb the streetscape. Filled with interesting facts and timelines, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of why

Um, so to that end, I'll do a brief introduction that end, I'll do a brief introduction of myself just so you kind of know what of myself just so you kind of know what I'm about before we dive into uh our I'm about before we dive into uh our talk today. As uh William so kindly talk today. As uh William so kindly said, "My name is Keith Talian. I'm a said, "My name is Keith Talian. I'm a New York City historian. I went to New York City historian. I went to undergrad for history. Always have loved undergrad for history. Always have loved history. Um could not figure out how to history. Um could not figure out how to turn a history bachelor's degree into a turn a history bachelor's degree into a paying gig for many years. Uh so when I paying gig for many years. Uh so when I moved to Manhattan in 2010, I kind of moved to Manhattan in 2010, I kind of tumbled into a rather boring corporate tumbled into a rather boring corporate job at the headquarters for Ralph Lauren job at the headquarters for Ralph Lauren and ended up staying there for 10 years and ended up staying there for 10 years as one does. Um I did earn my master's as one does. Um I did earn my master's degree taking night classes at Hunter degree taking night classes at Hunter College while working there. got my College while working there. got my masters in urban planning. Um, and so masters in urban planning. Um, and so then I had two degrees that I wasn't then I had two degrees that I wasn't using. Um, but happily I got laid off in using. Um, but happily I got laid off in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic and had nothing to do but collect and had nothing to do but collect severance checks and keep myself from severance checks and keep myself from going mad uh in 2020. So what I did to going mad uh in 2020. So what I did to fill the days was walk every block of fill the days was walk every block of Manhattan. And that's what I did from Manhattan. And that's what I did from Marble Hill down to the battery and from Marble Hill down to the battery and from river to river. I ended up walking just river to river. I ended up walking just shy of a thousand miles to cover the shy of a thousand miles to cover the entire island and just see what came of entire island and just see what came of that, to see what new things I could that, to see what new things I could learn about a city that I thought I knew learn about a city that I thought I knew so well. Um, sharing those walks and the so well. Um, sharing those walks and the history of what I was seeing on social history of what I was seeing on social media brought me a whole new following, media brought me a whole new following, uh, which brought some press attention, uh, which brought some press attention, a few early interviews, got me offers of a few early interviews, got me offers of paid writing and lecturing gigs, and by paid writing and lecturing gigs, and by the spring of 2021, I was actually the spring of 2021, I was actually earning a living as a historian using my earning a living as a historian using my degrees for the first time. And around degrees for the first time. And around that time, my social media followers that time, my social media followers also started asking if I could give also started asking if I could give walking tours because that felt like a walking tours because that felt like a safe thing to do when the pandemic was safe thing to do when the pandemic was still in its scary days. So, figured why still in its scary days. So, figured why not? Uh, got my tour guides license in not? Uh, got my tour guides license in April of 2021. Gave my first tour in April of 2021. Gave my first tour in June of that year. And just yesterday, I June of that year. And just yesterday, I gave my 442nd tour. gave my 442nd tour. The next happy thing out of that is that The next happy thing out of that is that because of the success of my social because of the success of my social media and uh my walking tours, I got the media and uh my walking tours, I got the attention of uh the folks at a really attention of uh the folks at a really great imprint called Quadriel, uh an great imprint called Quadriel, uh an imprint of um Penguin Random House UK uh imprint of um Penguin Random House UK uh who reached out in late 2023 asking if I who reached out in late 2023 asking if I wanted to write a book. So I said, wanted to write a book. So I said, "Sure, why not?" Uh, and I spent 2024 "Sure, why not?" Uh, and I spent 2024 kind of putting all my passion and kind of putting all my passion and knowledge of Manhattan that I've gleaned knowledge of Manhattan that I've gleaned over many years of study and walking over many years of study and walking into the book that you see on the right into the book that you see on the right of the, uh, screen behind me right now. of the, uh, screen behind me right now.

Uh tonight what I'm going to do for you is take you on a seated walking for you is take you on a seated walking tour uh through my book. We're actually tour uh through my book. We're actually gonna go through walk number four of my gonna go through walk number four of my book, which is Greenwich book, which is Greenwich Village. Let's see. Hold Village. Let's see. Hold on. The clicker took a second on. The clicker took a second before. It did work earlier. They just gone to sleep. Apologies. Sorry. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Sorry. Okay. And we're off. Okay. So this is a shot And we're off. Okay. So this is a shot from my actual book. This is walk number from my actual book. This is walk number four. And this is a route that I four. And this is a route that I actually offer as part of my tour actually offer as part of my tour business. Uh my Greenwich Village tour business. Uh my Greenwich Village tour attempts to unpack what the Greenwich attempts to unpack what the Greenwich Village what Greenwich Village is Village what Greenwich Village is historically from, you know, a boots on historically from, you know, a boots on the ground perspective. Uh because the ground perspective. Uh because Greenwich Village is one of those places Greenwich Village is one of those places I often compare it to my Central Park I often compare it to my Central Park tour. Central Park, Greenwich Village, tour. Central Park, Greenwich Village, they're places that everyone knows, they're places that everyone knows, everyone loves. They're beautiful, everyone loves. They're beautiful, they're easy to love. Uh, so what I try they're easy to love. Uh, so what I try to do is get into the nuts and bolts of to do is get into the nuts and bolts of actually what makes Greenwich Village actually what makes Greenwich Village Greenwich Village. And somewhat Greenwich Village. And somewhat inongruously, I start my Greenwich inongruously, I start my Greenwich Village tours in Aster Place, which Village tours in Aster Place, which historically is not part of Greenwich historically is not part of Greenwich Village. Um, while today there are Village. Um, while today there are technically kind of three different technically kind of three different villages. You've got the East Village villages. You've got the East Village east of the Bowery, you've got the West east of the Bowery, you've got the West Village west of 6th Avenue, and then Village west of 6th Avenue, and then kind of the catchall area in between kind of the catchall area in between around Washington Square and Aster Place around Washington Square and Aster Place known as either Novo, which is Greenwich known as either Novo, which is Greenwich Village. But historically, Greenwich Village. But historically, Greenwich Village was the village of Greenwich on Village was the village of Greenwich on the Hudson River, what is now called the the Hudson River, what is now called the West Village. And so, while starting at West Village. And so, while starting at Aster Place may seem odd, I have a Aster Place may seem odd, I have a reason for this. It's because Aster reason for this. It's because Aster Place is an ancient intersection of two Place is an ancient intersection of two Native American roads. One, the old Native American roads. One, the old Wazak or Maggan Trail, the North South Wazak or Maggan Trail, the North South Highway, uh, that bisects Manhattan, at Highway, uh, that bisects Manhattan, at least in parts still today. When the least in parts still today. When the Dutch arrived in the 1620s, they renamed Dutch arrived in the 1620s, they renamed this highway uh, the Bowery Road because this highway uh, the Bowery Road because Bowery is an old Dutch word for farm. Bowery is an old Dutch word for farm. And this road literally connected the And this road literally connected the city of New Amsterdam at the southern city of New Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan Island to the farms in tip of Manhattan Island to the farms in the north. Places like Peter Styverson's the north. Places like Peter Styverson's Great Bowery and what is now the East Great Bowery and what is now the East Village. Um intersecting that road and Village. Um intersecting that road and what's marked Kinta Coyang in the map what's marked Kinta Coyang in the map here on the right from the East Village here on the right from the East Village history project. Kinjukcoin was the history project. Kinjukcoin was the crossroads of four na or three nations crossroads of four na or three nations which is an intersection of the north which is an intersection of the north south highway and an east west south highway and an east west undulating road that connected the undulating road that connected the fertile fishing marshes of the east fertile fishing marshes of the east river waterfront all about what's now river waterfront all about what's now Stytown Peter Cooper village across the Stytown Peter Cooper village across the island to the village of Sapo island to the village of Sapo Canananakan or Sapo Hanacan uh roughly Canananakan or Sapo Hanacan uh roughly where the Whitney Museum is today that where the Whitney Museum is today that east west road exists today in pieces as east west road exists today in pieces as Stonen Street in the east aster place in Stonen Street in the east aster place in the middle and then Greenwich Avenue and the middle and then Greenwich Avenue and Gansor street and west, but they come Gansor street and west, but they come together in Aster Place. So I tell together in Aster Place. So I tell people this is arguably the oldest people this is arguably the oldest intersection in New York, predating intersection in New York, predating European contact by many centuries. European contact by many centuries. People have been walking through this People have been walking through this intersection and importantly using it as intersection and importantly using it as a way to get from New York at the a way to get from New York at the southern tip of the island over to southern tip of the island over to Sapokan or Greenwich on the west side of Sapokan or Greenwich on the west side of the island. Um this is a map of the island. Um this is a map of Manhattan with what is now Aster Place Manhattan with what is now Aster Place circled in red here on the left side. circled in red here on the left side. This map was drawn around the 1770s This map was drawn around the 1770s during the American Revolution. And as during the American Revolution. And as you can see, the dark filledin area of you can see, the dark filledin area of the left side of the map is the city of the left side of the map is the city of New York, which at that time really New York, which at that time really didn't extend much beyond Chambers didn't extend much beyond Chambers Street. The rest of the island was still Street. The rest of the island was still largely undeveloped as anything more largely undeveloped as anything more than a few collections of villages like than a few collections of villages like Bloomingdale and Harlem, um along with a Bloomingdale and Harlem, um along with a lot of hills, marshes, rocky areas, and lot of hills, marshes, rocky areas, and farms. Um but if you look at this map, farms. Um but if you look at this map, if you follow from the red circle if you follow from the red circle upward, you'll see a couple little words upward, you'll see a couple little words written there. One is the name Warren. written there. One is the name Warren. That is the family of Sir Peter Warren, That is the family of Sir Peter Warren, a British naval captain who owned a British naval captain who owned basically everything south of the Native basically everything south of the Native American road, so Ganzort and Greenwich American road, so Ganzort and Greenwich Avenue down to what is now Christopher Avenue down to what is now Christopher Street. Um, and that will come into play Street. Um, and that will come into play later in our talk. Um, but that is where later in our talk. Um, but that is where Greenwich Village would emerge from the Greenwich Village would emerge from the landscape. Prior to the establishment of landscape. Prior to the establishment of what we now know as Greenwich Village, what we now know as Greenwich Village, as I said, the area was a Native as I said, the area was a Native American village called Sapoan. thought American village called Sapoan. thought that that word in LA means something that that word in LA means something along the lines of the fact that the along the lines of the fact that the soil there was very good for growing soil there was very good for growing tobacco. And so that is what the land tobacco. And so that is what the land was used for before European contact. was used for before European contact. When the Europeans arrived, the land When the Europeans arrived, the land that formed Sepokan was given to that formed Sepokan was given to Governor General uh Uter Van Twiller who Governor General uh Uter Van Twiller who was a really colorful character in the was a really colorful character in the history of Dutch New York. Um he was a history of Dutch New York. Um he was a rather rotund man who was famous for rather rotund man who was famous for walking around town with a bugle. Um, walking around town with a bugle. Um, and one of his claims to fame is that and one of his claims to fame is that he, I hope I don't butcher the story, he, I hope I don't butcher the story, but he apparently fell into the really but he apparently fell into the really rough tidal waters between what is now rough tidal waters between what is now Inwood and Riverdale, uh, where the Inwood and Riverdale, uh, where the Harlem River meets the Hudson River. And Harlem River meets the Hudson River. And when he fell into the water, the storm when he fell into the water, the storm this there was a storm blew in and a sea this there was a storm blew in and a sea monster tried to swallow him up, but he monster tried to swallow him up, but he blasted his trumpet, made the monster blasted his trumpet, made the monster let him go, and thereafter that waterway let him go, and thereafter that waterway came to be known for the spitting devil came to be known for the spitting devil that attacked him or spite and dial in that attacked him or spite and dial in Dutch. So that's where that name comes Dutch. So that's where that name comes from. But Wood Van Twiller for our from. But Wood Van Twiller for our purposes uh farmed tobacco on his estate purposes uh farmed tobacco on his estate on what was Sapocan and what is now on what was Sapocan and what is now Greenwich Village. He called it Greenwich Village. He called it Northwick or the Northern District in Northwick or the Northern District in Old Dutch. It would later take on the Old Dutch. It would later take on the name through somewhat apocryphal name through somewhat apocryphal permutations, Greenwick or the Forested permutations, Greenwick or the Forested District. We think this name was likely District. We think this name was likely taken from another Dutch estate out on taken from another Dutch estate out on Long Island called Greenwick or the Long Island called Greenwick or the Green or Forested District. Um, and when Green or Forested District. Um, and when the British took over in 1664, they the British took over in 1664, they anglicized a lot of names. We from New anglicized a lot of names. We from New Amsterdam became New York and Green Wick Amsterdam became New York and Green Wick became Green Witch or Greenwich. So, a became Green Witch or Greenwich. So, a lot of people think that Greenwich lot of people think that Greenwich Village takes its name directly from Village takes its name directly from Greenwich in London. That's not entirely Greenwich in London. That's not entirely true. It was actually called Greenwich true. It was actually called Greenwich in Dutch before in Dutch before that. Now, this is the makeup of that. Now, this is the makeup of historic Greenwich Village, what is now historic Greenwich Village, what is now the West Village. And the black lines the West Village. And the black lines that I've drawn are the dividing lines that I've drawn are the dividing lines between the three major property parcels between the three major property parcels that help make the grid of Greenwich that help make the grid of Greenwich Village make sense. The top rectangle Village make sense. The top rectangle that you see formed here is that estate that you see formed here is that estate owned by the Warren family that I owned by the Warren family that I mentioned before. That was formerly Bur mentioned before. That was formerly Bur Van Twillers tobacco farm that was then Van Twillers tobacco farm that was then given over to British naval captain uh given over to British naval captain uh Sir Peter Warren. Um everything from Sir Peter Warren. Um everything from Christopher Street up to Gansport Street Christopher Street up to Gansport Street south of Greenwich Avenue belonged to south of Greenwich Avenue belonged to them. his descendants later gritted that them. his descendants later gritted that part of the neighborhood in a relatively part of the neighborhood in a relatively orderly rectalinear grid system. Which orderly rectalinear grid system. Which is why when you go to the West Village, is why when you go to the West Village, you'll notice the streets north of you'll notice the streets north of Christopher Street are quite orderly, Christopher Street are quite orderly, relatively luxuriously wide, um, and relatively luxuriously wide, um, and forms a pretty cohesive grid, even if forms a pretty cohesive grid, even if that grid is offkilter from the rest of that grid is offkilter from the rest of the city's grid. It is south of the city's grid. It is south of Christopher Street where things get a Christopher Street where things get a little wonky because the property down little wonky because the property down there that forms the southern half of there that forms the southern half of Redge Village was historically split Redge Village was historically split into two parcels. I've drawn a black into two parcels. I've drawn a black line down here down the middle below line down here down the middle below Christopher Street. That line to the Christopher Street. That line to the west of it was property owned by Trinity west of it was property owned by Trinity Church. Trinity Church was gifted a 215 Church. Trinity Church was gifted a 215 acre farm by Queen Anne back in about acre farm by Queen Anne back in about 1702 1703. And that Queen's farm turned 1702 1703. And that Queen's farm turned church farm extended along the Hudson church farm extended along the Hudson River from Fulton Street all the way to River from Fulton Street all the way to Christopher Street. So that southwest Christopher Street. So that southwest quadrant of modern-day West Village was quadrant of modern-day West Village was developed by Trinity Church on its own developed by Trinity Church on its own little grid. And then confusing matters little grid. And then confusing matters further to the east of that Trinity further to the east of that Trinity property line was a third estate that property line was a third estate that passed through several permutations. passed through several permutations. Most famously, it served as a country Most famously, it served as a country estate called Richmond Hill, which was estate called Richmond Hill, which was owned by several famous illustrious owned by several famous illustrious founding fathers, including, I believe, founding fathers, including, I believe, Aaron Burough if I'm not forgetting. But Aaron Burough if I'm not forgetting. But the last line that I've drawn on this the last line that I've drawn on this map, forgive my crude drawing, but the map, forgive my crude drawing, but the blue line at the bottom here that forms blue line at the bottom here that forms the southern boundary of Greenwich the southern boundary of Greenwich Village is the now buried river called Village is the now buried river called Manetta, the Manetta waters, Manetta Manetta, the Manetta waters, Manetta Creek. Um that river formed as springs Creek. Um that river formed as springs under Chelsea and then flowed down under Chelsea and then flowed down through what's now Washington Square through what's now Washington Square before curving out to the west of the before curving out to the west of the Hudson River, dumping into the river Hudson River, dumping into the river there. Over time, the river was buried there. Over time, the river was buried as a sewer. But still to this day, as a sewer. But still to this day, occasionally construction projects in occasionally construction projects in Chelsea and the village will Chelsea and the village will unexpectedly flood and people are very unexpectedly flood and people are very confused until they look at old confused until they look at old hydroponic or hydro hydrophonic maps of hydroponic or hydro hydrophonic maps of New York City and realize, "Oh, we're New York City and realize, "Oh, we're digging into a river here." So, no one digging into a river here." So, no one should have been surprised. They always should have been surprised. They always are. But understanding that the gran are. But understanding that the gran that Greenwich Village, which is so that Greenwich Village, which is so famously confusing to walk around, is famously confusing to walk around, is actually just three cobbled together actually just three cobbled together parcels of land, each with its own idea parcels of land, each with its own idea of where the streets should go, things of where the streets should go, things start to make a lot more sense. And the start to make a lot more sense. And the crux of those those three property lines crux of those those three property lines is roughly where Bedford Street meets is roughly where Bedford Street meets Chris uh Christopher Street. You go in Chris uh Christopher Street. You go in any direction, you're in a different any direction, you're in a different property, and then the village suddenly property, and then the village suddenly starts to make more starts to make more sense. The reason that I drill down into sense. The reason that I drill down into just the West Village is because of just the West Village is because of this. I I like to ruffle feathers by this. I I like to ruffle feathers by saying the East Village didn't exist saying the East Village didn't exist until the 1950s. In the 1950s, Greenwich until the 1950s. In the 1950s, Greenwich Village was going through one of its Village was going through one of its waves of what I call bohemianization. It waves of what I call bohemianization. It became very hip, very trendy, lots of became very hip, very trendy, lots of artists, lots of musicians. And this got artists, lots of musicians. And this got real estate brokers talking and thinking real estate brokers talking and thinking that if they rebranded a part of the that if they rebranded a part of the Lower East Side as the East Village, it Lower East Side as the East Village, it would sound more trendy and then garner would sound more trendy and then garner higher rents. And so this article from higher rents. And so this article from the New York Times in 1964 points out the New York Times in 1964 points out that fact that this formerly Russian and that fact that this formerly Russian and Ukrainian enclave east of the Bowery was Ukrainian enclave east of the Bowery was suddenly and often unexpectedly turning suddenly and often unexpectedly turning into a trendy district called the East into a trendy district called the East Village. With that area now called the Village. With that area now called the East Village, Greenwich Village now had East Village, Greenwich Village now had to differentiate itself by becoming to differentiate itself by becoming known as the West Village and the known as the West Village and the catchall area in between historically catchall area in between historically known by its major landmarks like known by its major landmarks like Washington Square or Fifth Avenue or Washington Square or Fifth Avenue or Aster Place or Lafayette Street now just Aster Place or Lafayette Street now just became Greenwich Village or Noohoo. But became Greenwich Village or Noohoo. But that's how we ended up with three that's how we ended up with three villages. But being uh obsessive about villages. But being uh obsessive about historic accuracy, my study of Greenwich historic accuracy, my study of Greenwich Village focuses on the West Village. And Village focuses on the West Village. And so to start our walk at Aster Place, I so to start our walk at Aster Place, I then take us west to Broadway and then then take us west to Broadway and then down to Washington Place where we turn down to Washington Place where we turn left toward Washington Square. Along the left toward Washington Square. Along the way on Washington Place, we passed way on Washington Place, we passed through what would have been at one time through what would have been at one time one of the city's finest neighborhoods one of the city's finest neighborhoods because after 1825, 1825, if you're not because after 1825, 1825, if you're not familiar, was the year that the Eerie familiar, was the year that the Eerie Canal opened in upstate New York, Canal opened in upstate New York, physically connecting the Great Lakes of physically connecting the Great Lakes of the western half of the United States to the western half of the United States to the Atlantic Ocean via the Hudson River the Atlantic Ocean via the Hudson River for the first time. And when that canal for the first time. And when that canal was completed in 1825, it cut travel was completed in 1825, it cut travel time between the western half of the time between the western half of the United States and the east coast by United States and the east coast by about 70% and importantly cut expense of about 70% and importantly cut expense of moving goods between these two places by moving goods between these two places by up to 90%. So when the Eerie Canal up to 90%. So when the Eerie Canal opened, it transformed New York, not opened, it transformed New York, not just the city, but all the cities along just the city, but all the cities along the path of the canal and the Hudson the path of the canal and the Hudson River with about half of the nation's River with about half of the nation's GDP almost overnight redirected down the GDP almost overnight redirected down the canal and down the Hudson River and out canal and down the Hudson River and out New York Harbor, which led to a massive New York Harbor, which led to a massive population explosion for New York City, population explosion for New York City, which is shown on this map from about which is shown on this map from about 1830. All the gray shaded areas are the 1830. All the gray shaded areas are the builtup populated areas of New York at builtup populated areas of New York at this time. And if you look closely, you this time. And if you look closely, you can see that most of what is now can see that most of what is now Greenwich Village has been subsumed by Greenwich Village has been subsumed by this urban development. Greenwich had this urban development. Greenwich had historically been a quite isolated rural historically been a quite isolated rural enclave, sitting miles north of the enclave, sitting miles north of the city, and importantly separated from the city, and importantly separated from the city by a tidal marsh that was fed by city by a tidal marsh that was fed by springs underneath what's now Chinatown. springs underneath what's now Chinatown. The water would bubble up, flood out The water would bubble up, flood out across the island of the Hudson and East across the island of the Hudson and East Rivers, and form a barrier, separating Rivers, and form a barrier, separating the city at the southern tip of the the city at the southern tip of the island from villages like Greenwich to island from villages like Greenwich to the north of the marsh. Knowing that the the north of the marsh. Knowing that the city was going to need to grow city was going to need to grow northward, while the state built the northward, while the state built the Eerie Canal upstate, the city dredged a Eerie Canal upstate, the city dredged a much smaller canal across the width of much smaller canal across the width of that marsh to drain all that fresh water that marsh to drain all that fresh water flowing from under what's now Chinatown flowing from under what's now Chinatown out to the Hudson River. The land was out to the Hudson River. The land was dried, gritted, and transformed into a dried, gritted, and transformed into a new highclass neighborhood called the new highclass neighborhood called the Spanard Meadows. The problem was this Spanard Meadows. The problem was this canal almost immediately became backed canal almost immediately became backed up with garbage and dead farm animals up with garbage and dead farm animals and whatever else people could dump in and whatever else people could dump in there, and it stunk. So the wealthy there, and it stunk. So the wealthy residents moving to this new residents moving to this new neighborhood complained to the city. The neighborhood complained to the city. The city fixed the problem by covering the city fixed the problem by covering the canal, creating the city's first sewer canal, creating the city's first sewer line. And that cover is today's canal line. And that cover is today's canal street. That neighborhood called street. That neighborhood called Lisbonard Meadows is now Tribeca and Lisbonard Meadows is now Tribeca and Soho. And with it made viable just in Soho. And with it made viable just in time for the Erie Canal to open, it time for the Erie Canal to open, it meant that the city's population could meant that the city's population could move northward as is shown in this map. move northward as is shown in this map. which means that in 1825 the formerly which means that in 1825 the formerly very isolated uh area that is now very isolated uh area that is now Washington Square was ripe for Washington Square was ripe for redevelopment which is amazing because redevelopment which is amazing because in 1825 when the Hary Canal opened what in 1825 when the Hary Canal opened what is now Washington Square had been is now Washington Square had been serving for about 30 years as the city's serving for about 30 years as the city's public burying ground for people who public burying ground for people who died of disease people who were executed died of disease people who were executed for crimes anybody who couldn't or for crimes anybody who couldn't or shouldn't be buried in churchyards in shouldn't be buried in churchyards in the city were dragged out to the middle the city were dragged out to the middle of nowhere to be buried in this potter's of nowhere to be buried in this potter's field on the banks of the Manetta field on the banks of the Manetta In 1825, knowing rich people were now In 1825, knowing rich people were now going to be pushing north of Lispanard going to be pushing north of Lispanard Meadows into this area to the east of Meadows into this area to the east of Greenwich Village, the city shut down Greenwich Village, the city shut down the Pottersfield, landscaped it, and the Pottersfield, landscaped it, and reopened it in 1827 as Washington parade reopened it in 1827 as Washington parade ground. And a lot of you probably ground. And a lot of you probably already know this, but you might notice already know this, but you might notice might have noticed that I didn't mention might have noticed that I didn't mention they moved the bodies. That is because they moved the bodies. That is because they did not. There are currently they did not. There are currently between 20 and 25,000 people buried between 20 and 25,000 people buried underneath Washington Square Park. But underneath Washington Square Park. But that didn't stop developers from that didn't stop developers from capitalizing on the beauty of this new capitalizing on the beauty of this new green space. They they ringed Washington green space. They they ringed Washington Square and the surrounding blocks with Square and the surrounding blocks with some of the city's finest new town some of the city's finest new town houses and mansions. Um many of which houses and mansions. Um many of which you can still see today, especially on you can still see today, especially on the north side of Washington Square. the north side of Washington Square. Many of them are now owned by NYU, but Many of them are now owned by NYU, but at least their facades are preserved, at least their facades are preserved, showing you what life was like for the showing you what life was like for the city's elite in the 1830s and 40s when city's elite in the 1830s and 40s when this area first developed, extending the this area first developed, extending the bounds of formerly isolated Greenwich bounds of formerly isolated Greenwich Village into a much larger rural Village into a much larger rural area. On our way toward Washington area. On our way toward Washington Square, however, on Washington Place, Square, however, on Washington Place, we're passed by a now lost landmark of we're passed by a now lost landmark of one of the city's most elite one of the city's most elite industrialists from the 19th century, industrialists from the 19th century, Cornelius Vanderbilt. Cornelius Cornelius Vanderbilt. Cornelius Vanderbilt was born a poor farm boy out Vanderbilt was born a poor farm boy out on Staten Island. Uh borrowed $100 from on Staten Island. Uh borrowed $100 from his mother as a teenager to buy a his mother as a teenager to buy a schooner that he used to take farm goods schooner that he used to take farm goods from Staten Island to market in from Staten Island to market in Manhattan. This made him wealthy enough Manhattan. This made him wealthy enough that he was able to buy more boats, hire that he was able to buy more boats, hire more sailors, and he ultimately by the more sailors, and he ultimately by the time he was in his early 20s, commanded time he was in his early 20s, commanded a fleet of more than a dozen ships, a fleet of more than a dozen ships, earning him the intended to be porative earning him the intended to be porative nickname of the Commodore because older nickname of the Commodore because older sailors saw this boy commanding a fleet sailors saw this boy commanding a fleet of ships around the harbor in the Hudson of ships around the harbor in the Hudson River in Long Island Sound and made fun River in Long Island Sound and made fun of him for that fact. But he took that of him for that fact. But he took that name on as a badge of honor and to the name on as a badge of honor and to the end of his life, he was known as the end of his life, he was known as the Commodore, a title he had not earned, Commodore, a title he had not earned, but rather been bestowed upon him. When but rather been bestowed upon him. When Cornelius was in his 50s, he had become Cornelius was in his 50s, he had become one of the wealthiest men in the country one of the wealthiest men in the country and decided to move his family finally and decided to move his family finally from the farm on Staten Island into from the farm on Staten Island into Manhattan, where his business interests Manhattan, where his business interests were. And he could have afforded to live were. And he could have afforded to live quite literally anywhere that he wanted. quite literally anywhere that he wanted. He chose to build this house here on the He chose to build this house here on the left, number 10 Washington Place, just a left, number 10 Washington Place, just a block off of Washington Square. And he block off of Washington Square. And he moved there in 1846 and remained there moved there in 1846 and remained there until his death in 1877, at which time until his death in 1877, at which time he was worth an estimated $100 million. he was worth an estimated $100 million. But what's important for Cornelius But what's important for Cornelius Vanderbilt's death and for neighborhoods Vanderbilt's death and for neighborhoods like this is that when this generation like this is that when this generation of wealthy Washington Square resident of wealthy Washington Square resident died off, there was not a a a died off, there was not a a a commensurate generation of wealthy commensurate generation of wealthy people waiting in the wings to buy these people waiting in the wings to buy these old-fashioned houses in a neighborhood old-fashioned houses in a neighborhood that was now unfashionably downtown as that was now unfashionably downtown as the center of society by the time he the center of society by the time he died in the 1870s had pushed up through died in the 1870s had pushed up through Murray Hill and was beginning to push Murray Hill and was beginning to push north of 42nd Street. So rather than north of 42nd Street. So rather than have a new family move into this have a new family move into this mansion, it was sold off to a mansion, it was sold off to a speculative industrial developer, torn speculative industrial developer, torn down and replaced by factory lofts, a down and replaced by factory lofts, a fate that uh was met by many of the fate that uh was met by many of the mansions, especially on the east and mansions, especially on the east and south sides of Washington Square Park at south sides of Washington Square Park at this time. Um the most famous of these this time. Um the most famous of these speculative industrial lofts built speculative industrial lofts built around this time at the turn end of the around this time at the turn end of the 19th and turn of the 20th century was 19th and turn of the 20th century was the one at the corner of Green Street the one at the corner of Green Street and Washington Place. It's famous, and Washington Place. It's famous, though. It was built in 1901 because though. It was built in 1901 because several years after being constructed, several years after being constructed, the top three floors of this building the top three floors of this building were leased out to a women's garment were leased out to a women's garment manufacturer called the Triangle Waist manufacturer called the Triangle Waist Company, who used the 8th, 9th, and 10th Company, who used the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors to employ hundreds of mostly im floors to employ hundreds of mostly im young immigrant women and girls to sew young immigrant women and girls to sew shirt waist, which were a popular shirt waist, which were a popular Edwardian garment for women um that were Edwardian garment for women um that were sold in department stores all across the sold in department stores all across the city. So, there's nothing inherently city. So, there's nothing inherently special about the Triangle Waste special about the Triangle Waste Company. There would have been dozens of Company. There would have been dozens of similar companies in this neighborhood similar companies in this neighborhood producing the goods to be sold in the producing the goods to be sold in the department stores pushing their way up department stores pushing their way up Broadway and the bowy toward Union Broadway and the bowy toward Union Square at this time. What makes the Square at this time. What makes the Triangle Waste Company and this building Triangle Waste Company and this building so important is that a fire broke out on so important is that a fire broke out on the 8th floor on March 25th, 1911, the 8th floor on March 25th, 1911, quickly raged through all three floors quickly raged through all three floors of the building at a time when there of the building at a time when there were very lax workplace safety laws. And were very lax workplace safety laws. And ultimately because the doors were locked ultimately because the doors were locked and because the fire department lacked and because the fire department lacked the technology to save any of them with the technology to save any of them with their two short ladders and their two their two short ladders and their two weak nets um 146 people died in this weak nets um 146 people died in this confilration which did spark a cascade confilration which did spark a cascade of workplace safety laws thereafter. But of workplace safety laws thereafter. But the reason I tell this story is not just the reason I tell this story is not just because it's tragic and it's important because it's tragic and it's important to history, but also because it paints to history, but also because it paints in very stark relief the rapidity with in very stark relief the rapidity with which the east side of Washington which the east side of Washington Square, this formerly wealthy Square, this formerly wealthy neighborhood, was chewed up and spit out neighborhood, was chewed up and spit out by the advent of modernity. As the city by the advent of modernity. As the city continued to churn its way up town, continued to churn its way up town, wherever rich folks at Cornelius wherever rich folks at Cornelius Vanderbilt went, inevitably businesses Vanderbilt went, inevitably businesses followed, and behind businesses came followed, and behind businesses came industry, and behind industry came industry, and behind industry came usually a poor immigrant population for usually a poor immigrant population for the jobs that they provided. There's the jobs that they provided. There's just 34 years separating the death of just 34 years separating the death of the Commodore at number 10 Washington the Commodore at number 10 Washington Place and the death of 146 immigrant Place and the death of 146 immigrant women and girls in the Triangle Waste women and girls in the Triangle Waste Company on fire just across the street. Company on fire just across the street. So this neighborhood was flipped upside So this neighborhood was flipped upside down in the wake of the departure of down in the wake of the departure of that generation of wealthy people who that generation of wealthy people who had moved here in the early half of the had moved here in the early half of the 19th century, transforming the rest of 19th century, transforming the rest of Washington Square's east side. But Washington Square's east side. But that's an important point is that that that's an important point is that that train of fate only befell parts of the train of fate only befell parts of the central village because the streets central village because the streets around where Washington Place and Green around where Washington Place and Green Street now stand wider and straighter Street now stand wider and straighter than the streets that you find west of than the streets that you find west of 6th Avenue in the historic more colonial 6th Avenue in the historic more colonial part of Greenwich Village, which made part of Greenwich Village, which made what's now the West Village not as what's now the West Village not as adaptable for industry. So when industry adaptable for industry. So when industry washed its way up the island, it tended washed its way up the island, it tended to wash around Greenwich Village, to wash around Greenwich Village, ignoring these tight, crooked little ignoring these tight, crooked little residential streets, allowing Greenwich residential streets, allowing Greenwich Village to kind of sit there and become Village to kind of sit there and become ever more charming and ever more rare in ever more charming and ever more rare in an area completely surrounded by an area completely surrounded by industry and commerce, if that makes industry and commerce, if that makes sense. Now, this is an aerial photo sense. Now, this is an aerial photo showing Washington Square, and you can showing Washington Square, and you can see how densely developed the area see how densely developed the area around the park was, considering this around the park was, considering this photo was taken, I believe, in the photo was taken, I believe, in the 1930s. It would have just been a hundred 1930s. It would have just been a hundred years prior that this was so isolated years prior that this was so isolated from the city's population that that from the city's population that that little rectangle in the middle, now little rectangle in the middle, now known as Washington Square, would have known as Washington Square, would have been used for public burials. Um, in the been used for public burials. Um, in the middle of Washington Square in this middle of Washington Square in this photo, if you squint, you can see the photo, if you squint, you can see the little arch that forms the most uh little arch that forms the most uh identifiable landmark in Washington identifiable landmark in Washington Square. This is the Washington Square Square. This is the Washington Square Arch, ostensively designed and built to Arch, ostensively designed and built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of commemorate the 100th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration, which George Washington's inauguration, which took place down on Wall Street in 1789 took place down on Wall Street in 1789 during New York's brief stint as the during New York's brief stint as the National Capital. It actually is not the National Capital. It actually is not the original Washington Square arch. There original Washington Square arch. There was an older one that was never meant to was an older one that was never meant to be permanent, which stood just north of be permanent, which stood just north of Washington Square, actually spanning Washington Square, actually spanning Fifth Avenue. It was made of plaster and Fifth Avenue. It was made of plaster and wood, and it was actually put up in 1889 wood, and it was actually put up in 1889 on the 100th anniversary of Washington's on the 100th anniversary of Washington's inauguration. Archels like this went up inauguration. Archels like this went up around the city almost annually for around the city almost annually for different celebrations and different celebrations and commemorations. As they started to fall commemorations. As they started to fall apart, they'd simply be ripped down and apart, they'd simply be ripped down and a new one would go up somewhere else for a new one would go up somewhere else for something else. But occasionally, as was something else. But occasionally, as was the case here, New Yorkers would love the case here, New Yorkers would love the commemoration so much that they the commemoration so much that they would arrange to raise funds to build a would arrange to raise funds to build a new, more permanent arch. And that's new, more permanent arch. And that's what happened here. In what happened here. In 1895, the arch that we now know in 1895, the arch that we now know in Washington Square was commemorated Washington Square was commemorated inside Washington Square Park to designs inside Washington Square Park to designs by the architectural firm of McKimme and by the architectural firm of McKimme and White. Now, from the arch, we'll make White. Now, from the arch, we'll make our way up Fifth Avenue to 11th Street, our way up Fifth Avenue to 11th Street, where we'll turn left and run into a where we'll turn left and run into a very unusual townhouse that does not very unusual townhouse that does not seem to match the rest of the early 19th seem to match the rest of the early 19th century streetscape in the village. Um, century streetscape in the village. Um, the houses that surround number 18 West the houses that surround number 18 West 11th Street were all built in the 1840s 11th Street were all built in the 1840s on speculation, similar to the houses I on speculation, similar to the houses I talked about before on Washington talked about before on Washington Square. The biggest difference is here Square. The biggest difference is here that between the north side of that between the north side of Washington Square and 11th Street, about Washington Square and 11th Street, about a decade lasts between the construction a decade lasts between the construction of those houses. And in that decade, the of those houses. And in that decade, the 1830s to the 1840s, New Yorkers got 1830s to the 1840s, New Yorkers got access to a really cheap and unreliable access to a really cheap and unreliable kind of stone called brownstone that was kind of stone called brownstone that was being quarried in central Connecticut being quarried in central Connecticut and could be hauled down to the city by and could be hauled down to the city by new rail technology in massive new rail technology in massive quantities in the 1840s. And so these quantities in the 1840s. And so these blocks just north of Washington Square blocks just north of Washington Square are some of the first places in New York are some of the first places in New York that you see houses employed brownstone that you see houses employed brownstone in fa in in place of more expensive in fa in in place of more expensive harder stones like marble, limestone or harder stones like marble, limestone or granite because brownstone could achieve granite because brownstone could achieve the same stone effect that you wanted the same stone effect that you wanted aesthetically on your house for a aesthetically on your house for a fraction of the cost because it's so fraction of the cost because it's so porous, so light and so easy to carve. porous, so light and so easy to carve. Um, the important thing here is that Um, the important thing here is that Brownstone ultimately fell from favor Brownstone ultimately fell from favor after washing through the city's after washing through the city's streetscape in the 1840s through the streetscape in the 1840s through the 1880s. Uh, because of all of its, uh, 1880s. Uh, because of all of its, uh, everything that made it so popular led everything that made it so popular led to its downfall. Because brownstone is to its downfall. Because brownstone is light and easy to work with. That's light and easy to work with. That's because it's porous and soaks up water, because it's porous and soaks up water, which then freezes inside the stone which then freezes inside the stone during the winter and causes the stone during the winter and causes the stone to crack and flake and turn back into to crack and flake and turn back into sand. which is why you generally don't sand. which is why you generally don't see brownstone used in the city see brownstone used in the city basically at all after about basically at all after about 1895. Um but anyway, that's I'm 1895. Um but anyway, that's I'm rambling, but that is um the big rambling, but that is um the big evolution that you see just in a couple evolution that you see just in a couple blocks. It's fascinating once you know blocks. It's fascinating once you know that Brownstone emerges only there in that Brownstone emerges only there in that moment in time because rail that moment in time because rail suddenly allowed New Yorkers access to suddenly allowed New Yorkers access to these quaries in the middle of these quaries in the middle of Connecticut. But back to number 18 West Connecticut. But back to number 18 West 11 Street. Why is it so different? Why 11 Street. Why is it so different? Why is a house so modern plopped in the is a house so modern plopped in the middle of a block that has been a middle of a block that has been a historic district for decades? Um that historic district for decades? Um that is because during the 1960s and 70s when is because during the 1960s and 70s when Ranch Village was a hotbed it was really Ranch Village was a hotbed it was really in its second wave of bohemianization a in its second wave of bohemianization a hotbed for counterculturalism hotbed for counterculturalism um unbeknownst to its neighbors uh um unbeknownst to its neighbors uh members of a a domestic terrorist members of a a domestic terrorist organization called the Weathermen uh organization called the Weathermen uh were building bombs inside that house at were building bombs inside that house at number 18 West 11th Street and number 18 West 11th Street and accidentally one of the bombs went off accidentally one of the bombs went off causing a series of explosions inside causing a series of explosions inside this house blowing the facade off of the this house blowing the facade off of the building. Um people didn't think it was building. Um people didn't think it was a gas explosion at first before the real a gas explosion at first before the real story was found out later. Um but it was story was found out later. Um but it was one of the more traumatic events. Uh one of the more traumatic events. Uh this occurred in March 6th, 1970. One of this occurred in March 6th, 1970. One of more the more traumatic events of quite more the more traumatic events of quite a tumultuous era for Greenwich Village. a tumultuous era for Greenwich Village. Um Dustin Hoffman and the actor actually Um Dustin Hoffman and the actor actually lived next door. We were 16 at the time. lived next door. We were 16 at the time. And there are photos, this is a photo of And there are photos, this is a photo of him standing in front of the burning him standing in front of the burning house. Uh but there are other photos of house. Uh but there are other photos of him running down the street holding him running down the street holding paintings he was trying to save from his paintings he was trying to save from his house cuz everybody thought the whole house cuz everybody thought the whole block might go down. Um, but ultimately block might go down. Um, but ultimately after much debate, it was decided that after much debate, it was decided that rather than try to recreate a historic rather than try to recreate a historic townhouse that would inevitably not look townhouse that would inevitably not look quite right, that a compromised building quite right, that a compromised building could go in place of the the blownoff could go in place of the the blownoff house, uh, the result is this townhouse house, uh, the result is this townhouse completed in the late 1970s, which the completed in the late 1970s, which the facade is meant to kind of evoke the facade is meant to kind of evoke the explosion that blew off the facade of explosion that blew off the facade of the original house. Um, in its the original house. Um, in its modernity, still trying to match its modernity, still trying to match its stoop and cornice to the rest of its stoop and cornice to the rest of its neighbors. Now, from 18 West 11th neighbors. Now, from 18 West 11th Street, we'll continue west along 11th Street, we'll continue west along 11th Street until we find this little Street until we find this little triangle hidden behind a brick and iron triangle hidden behind a brick and iron fence near 6th Avenue. If you've never fence near 6th Avenue. If you've never noticed this before, you cannot be noticed this before, you cannot be blamed. I've had a lot of lifelong blamed. I've had a lot of lifelong village residents on my tours tell me village residents on my tours tell me that they've never stopped to notice that they've never stopped to notice this before, but this little triangle is this before, but this little triangle is what's called the second Spanish and what's called the second Spanish and Portuguese synagogue cemetery, uh, Portuguese synagogue cemetery, uh, established in 1805. established in 1805. It was an outgrowth of what is now It was an outgrowth of what is now Congregation Shirith Israel, the oldest Congregation Shirith Israel, the oldest active Jewish congregation in the active Jewish congregation in the Western Hemisphere. Their first Western Hemisphere. Their first cemetery, because this is the second cemetery, because this is the second cemetery, their first cemetery still cemetery, their first cemetery still exists today down on St. James Place, exists today down on St. James Place, just off of Chadam Square in Chinatown. just off of Chadam Square in Chinatown. That cemetery was established in the That cemetery was established in the 1680s, and by the 1800s, it was 1680s, and by the 1800s, it was beginning to fill up. So, the beginning to fill up. So, the congregation looked for a new place on congregation looked for a new place on the outskirts of town where they could the outskirts of town where they could start burying their dead a new. And the start burying their dead a new. And the plot of land that they bought was a plot of land that they bought was a rectangle rectangle rectangle uh outside of Greenwich Village but uh outside of Greenwich Village but angled to the grid of Greenwich Village. angled to the grid of Greenwich Village. It's kind of wonky diagonal grid. The It's kind of wonky diagonal grid. The cemetery was established before the cemetery was established before the city's grid plan washed through the city's grid plan washed through the area. So they began burying people there area. So they began burying people there in 1805. The city's grid system was in 1805. The city's grid system was approved in 1811 and the writing was on approved in 1811 and the writing was on the wall for the cemetery that the wall for the cemetery that eventually it sat in the way of 11th eventually it sat in the way of 11th Street, which is this confusing looking Street, which is this confusing looking map I have on the screen right now, map I have on the screen right now, where you can see the diagonal property where you can see the diagonal property lines of the outskirts of Ranch Village lines of the outskirts of Ranch Village clashing with the planned streets of the clashing with the planned streets of the city's grid system. And this red city's grid system. And this red rectangle that I've zoomed in on the top rectangle that I've zoomed in on the top right here is labeled Jews burying right here is labeled Jews burying ground. And the vast majority of this ground. And the vast majority of this burying ground sits right in the middle burying ground sits right in the middle of what would become West 11th Street. of what would become West 11th Street. So the city notified the congregation in So the city notified the congregation in 1829 that they needed to move their dead 1829 that they needed to move their dead out of the way of the new street. They out of the way of the new street. They did so, moving many of them into the did so, moving many of them into the little triangle that was left over at little triangle that was left over at the edge of the cemetery that is still the edge of the cemetery that is still there today. Moving many more of them to there today. Moving many more of them to the third cemetery of the Spanish and the third cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue, which still exists Portuguese synagogue, which still exists today on West 21st Street, just west of today on West 21st Street, just west of 6th Avenue in Chelsea off of Ladies Mile 6th Avenue in Chelsea off of Ladies Mile behind what used to be a vitamin shop. behind what used to be a vitamin shop. Um, but as I've drawn crudely with this Um, but as I've drawn crudely with this red rectangle here, that little triangle red rectangle here, that little triangle cemetery not only speaks to the history cemetery not only speaks to the history of this illustrious Jewish congregation, of this illustrious Jewish congregation, again the oldest active Jewish again the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Western Hemisphere, congregation in the Western Hemisphere, but it also is one of the few places but it also is one of the few places where you can actively see the clash where you can actively see the clash between the diagonal kooky grid at between the diagonal kooky grid at Greenwich Village and the more Greenwich Village and the more regimented numbered grid of the city regimented numbered grid of the city where they clash together. where they clash together. Once we pass the cemetery, we reach 6th Once we pass the cemetery, we reach 6th Avenue and what is essentially the Avenue and what is essentially the eastern bounds of actual historic eastern bounds of actual historic Greenwich Village. And you get a great Greenwich Village. And you get a great view uh from that corner looking south view uh from that corner looking south toward Jefferson Market Library. Um the toward Jefferson Market Library. Um the history of this building is tied into history of this building is tied into the transformation of Greenwich Village the transformation of Greenwich Village from what was what it was previously a from what was what it was previously a kind of isolated rural village mostly kind of isolated rural village mostly populated by seasonal residents fleeing populated by seasonal residents fleeing waves of disease down in the city. After waves of disease down in the city. After the opening of the Erie Canal, more and the opening of the Erie Canal, more and more people began to choose Greenwich more people began to choose Greenwich Village as a permanent residence. Um, Village as a permanent residence. Um, and so with that permanent residence, and so with that permanent residence, the town needed a market place for the town needed a market place for people to get their dairy and their meat people to get their dairy and their meat and their vegetables. And so in 1833, and their vegetables. And so in 1833, Jefferson Market opened on that little Jefferson Market opened on that little triangle of land where 10th Street and triangle of land where 10th Street and 6th Avenue meet today. But that original 6th Avenue meet today. But that original market was not a thing of beauty. It was market was not a thing of beauty. It was a ramshackle complex of assembly rooms, a ramshackle complex of assembly rooms, police halls, jail cells, all capped by police halls, jail cells, all capped by this 100 or so foot tall wood and iron this 100 or so foot tall wood and iron structure that fireman would use to look structure that fireman would use to look for smoke on the horizon. If you zoom for smoke on the horizon. If you zoom really closely on this photo, you'll see really closely on this photo, you'll see there's a bell hanging inside that tower there's a bell hanging inside that tower that the firemen would ring if they saw that the firemen would ring if they saw smoke to alert firemen to go fight the smoke to alert firemen to go fight the fire somewhere in Greenwich Village. By fire somewhere in Greenwich Village. By the 1860s, with the end of the Civil the 1860s, with the end of the Civil War, New York City was entering what we War, New York City was entering what we now know as its guilded age. And the now know as its guilded age. And the city leaders were desperate to make New city leaders were desperate to make New York as pedigreed and cultured as global York as pedigreed and cultured as global capitals like London and Paris. And capitals like London and Paris. And ramshackle complexes like this serving a ramshackle complexes like this serving a governmental function were an governmental function were an embarrassment to us at this time. So, embarrassment to us at this time. So, the city ordered the original Jefferson the city ordered the original Jefferson Market torn down in the late 1860s and Market torn down in the late 1860s and it was replaced by a new Jefferson it was replaced by a new Jefferson Market courthouse complex with market Market courthouse complex with market stalls, a courthouse, and a jail all stalls, a courthouse, and a jail all filling that same triangular plot, but filling that same triangular plot, but built in a much more beautiful high goth built in a much more beautiful high goth uh Gothic Victorian style designed by uh Gothic Victorian style designed by Frederick Clark Withers of the studio of Frederick Clark Withers of the studio of Calvert Box who was one of the designers Calvert Box who was one of the designers for Central Park. for Central Park. Um, by the early 20th century, Americans Um, by the early 20th century, Americans had begun to shift away from public had begun to shift away from public market systems like Jefferson. And so, market systems like Jefferson. And so, the market stalls were no longer needed, the market stalls were no longer needed, and there was a need for more jail space and there was a need for more jail space in the neighborhood. So, the old park in the neighborhood. So, the old park and stalls in the original jail were and stalls in the original jail were torn down and replaced in 1932 by this torn down and replaced in 1932 by this hulking art deco slab known as the hulking art deco slab known as the women's house of detention uh which women's house of detention uh which played a really integral role in the played a really integral role in the kind of cacophinous life of early kind of cacophinous life of early bohemian Greenwich Village. Poets like bohemian Greenwich Village. Poets like EE Cummings who lived on patchy place EE Cummings who lived on patchy place nearby would write about the sounds of nearby would write about the sounds of women yelling to their boyfriends down women yelling to their boyfriends down in the street from the windows of this in the street from the windows of this jail all night. Um it was a really jail all night. Um it was a really really interesting landmark in Greenwich really interesting landmark in Greenwich Village for the decades that it existed. Village for the decades that it existed. Uh but by the 1940s and 50s government Uh but by the 1940s and 50s government functions for New York had begun to be functions for New York had begun to be uh concentrated more downtown. Greenwich uh concentrated more downtown. Greenwich Village ceased to serve its own court Village ceased to serve its own court and jail functions. The courthouse was and jail functions. The courthouse was shut down and turned into a police shut down and turned into a police station briefly. The women's house of station briefly. The women's house of detention was likewise shut down in the detention was likewise shut down in the 1970s and torn down. Thankfully the 1970s and torn down. Thankfully the courthouse was not demolished in the courthouse was not demolished in the 1960s when it was emptied out. It was 1960s when it was emptied out. It was instead saved by with the help of the instead saved by with the help of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Greenwich Village Society for the Greenwich Village Society for Hestoric Preservation and transformed Hestoric Preservation and transformed into Greenwich Village's branch of the into Greenwich Village's branch of the New York Public Library which it is New York Public Library which it is today. And the site of the Women's House today. And the site of the Women's House of Detention is now a beautiful public of Detention is now a beautiful public garden. Now, from Jefferson Market, we garden. Now, from Jefferson Market, we follow West 10th Street West a couple of follow West 10th Street West a couple of blocks um to visit the the beginnings of blocks um to visit the the beginnings of what we now would call the Queer what we now would call the Queer Liberation Movement, stopping first at a Liberation Movement, stopping first at a bar called Julius's, which just bar called Julius's, which just yesterday celebrated the 59th yesterday celebrated the 59th anniversary of the greatest event uh to anniversary of the greatest event uh to happen there, helping to kickstart the happen there, helping to kickstart the queer liberation movement in the queer liberation movement in the village. What happened essentially was village. What happened essentially was that after World War II, a whole that after World War II, a whole cavalcade of new anti-gay laws began to cavalcade of new anti-gay laws began to go on the books around the United States go on the books around the United States in part because the United States was in part because the United States was trying to position itself as sort of the trying to position itself as sort of the godly nuclear family alternative to the godly nuclear family alternative to the Soviet Union. This was all kind of a Soviet Union. This was all kind of a cold war ploy to uh clamp to to clamp cold war ploy to uh clamp to to clamp down on what was previously just kind of down on what was previously just kind of swept under the rug as vice. So you see swept under the rug as vice. So you see this whole new slew of laws, including this whole new slew of laws, including one in particular that uh technically one in particular that uh technically forbade homosexuals to be served alcohol forbade homosexuals to be served alcohol because the state liquor authority of because the state liquor authority of New York uh declared that alcohol could New York uh declared that alcohol could not be served to uh disorderly persons not be served to uh disorderly persons and homosexuals or perceived homosexuals and homosexuals or perceived homosexuals were by by default considered were by by default considered disorderly. And so organizations began disorderly. And so organizations began to rise up after World War II, including to rise up after World War II, including the Matteen Society, which was founded the Matteen Society, which was founded out in Los Angeles in the 1950s and out in Los Angeles in the 1950s and opened a New York chapter office in the opened a New York chapter office in the early 1960s. They sought to take direct early 1960s. They sought to take direct action against these unjust laws by action against these unjust laws by trying to bring press attention against trying to bring press attention against them and the fact that they were so them and the fact that they were so unfair. Um, and so the Madisheen Society unfair. Um, and so the Madisheen Society in New York took its greatest uh act in in New York took its greatest uh act in in on April 21st, 1966 when three of in on April 21st, 1966 when three of their members went with a press their members went with a press photographer to Julius's, which was not photographer to Julius's, which was not an explicitly gay bar. It was a bar that an explicitly gay bar. It was a bar that had been operating as a bar for many had been operating as a bar for many decades. Uh, it was just known within decades. Uh, it was just known within gay circles in Greenwich Village that it gay circles in Greenwich Village that it was a place where you could go and meet was a place where you could go and meet other like-minded men. As such, Julius's other like-minded men. As such, Julius's was regularly raided uh by the police was regularly raided uh by the police and was in danger of losing its liquor and was in danger of losing its liquor license when the Madachine Society license when the Madachine Society arrived in April of 1966. The members of arrived in April of 1966. The members of the Madachine Society read from a script the Madachine Society read from a script that read something, if I'm remembering that read something, if I'm remembering correctly, along the lines of, "I am a correctly, along the lines of, "I am a homosexual. I am orderly. I plan to homosexual. I am orderly. I plan to remain orderly and I would like to be remain orderly and I would like to be served a drink." Nervous about losing served a drink." Nervous about losing their liquor license, the bartender put their liquor license, the bartender put his hand out over the drink and said, "I his hand out over the drink and said, "I don't think I can serve you." The don't think I can serve you." The photographer in tow got this photo which photographer in tow got this photo which was on the front page of many of New was on the front page of many of New York's major newspapers the next day. York's major newspapers the next day. And by the end of that year, against the And by the end of that year, against the the backlash from this, the state liquor the backlash from this, the state liquor authority had to clarify that authority had to clarify that homosexuals were not inherently um homosexuals were not inherently um prevented from ordering alcohol. Uh prevented from ordering alcohol. Uh though many other anti-gay laws remained though many other anti-gay laws remained on the books. Now they could be served on the books. Now they could be served alcohol, but you still couldn't be alcohol, but you still couldn't be caught touching someone of the same caught touching someone of the same gender. You couldn't be caught in gender. You couldn't be caught in clothes that didn't match your gender. clothes that didn't match your gender. Um it was still a very hard era for this Um it was still a very hard era for this community, but through the actions of community, but through the actions of the Machine Society in what is now known the Machine Society in what is now known as the Sipin at Julius's, as the Sipin at Julius's, um that's that specific law was eased um that's that specific law was eased up. 3 years later, a very different up. 3 years later, a very different event took place just around the corner event took place just around the corner from Julius's on Christopher Street. from Julius's on Christopher Street. These two buildings you see behind me These two buildings you see behind me were built as stables in the about 1845. were built as stables in the about 1845. By the end of the 19th century, with the By the end of the 19th century, with the decline of the horse and carriage trade, decline of the horse and carriage trade, these two stables were transformed into these two stables were transformed into plain old commercial spaces. And by the plain old commercial spaces. And by the 1930s, the two stables were combined 1930s, the two stables were combined into one restaurant storefront. Um, into one restaurant storefront. Um, owned by an Italian restaurant tour owned by an Italian restaurant tour named Vincent Bonnie Bonavilla, who had named Vincent Bonnie Bonavilla, who had been running a speak easy illegally on been running a speak easy illegally on 7th Avenue through prohibition. But with 7th Avenue through prohibition. But with prohibition over, he was able to bring prohibition over, he was able to bring his restaurant above ground and actually his restaurant above ground and actually make it legitimate. And in honor of the make it legitimate. And in honor of the fact that he had stonewalled the fact that he had stonewalled the authorities during prohibition, he named authorities during prohibition, he named his new restaurant Bonnie Stonewall Inn. his new restaurant Bonnie Stonewall Inn. Bonnie Stonewall Inn operated out of Bonnie Stonewall Inn operated out of those two old carriage houses into the those two old carriage houses into the 1960s when a fire in the kitchen um 1960s when a fire in the kitchen um caused them to shut down. The buildings caused them to shut down. The buildings were then sold to the Jenzy Crime family were then sold to the Jenzy Crime family of New York, who turned them into a gay of New York, who turned them into a gay bar. Now, this is often surprising to bar. Now, this is often surprising to people, but a lot of gay bars in people, but a lot of gay bars in Greenwich Village were owned and Greenwich Village were owned and operated by the mob in the 1950s,60s, operated by the mob in the 1950s,60s, and 70s because the mob could get a and 70s because the mob could get a profit off of a captive audience that profit off of a captive audience that had nowhere else to go while watering had nowhere else to go while watering down and overcharging for drinks. Um, down and overcharging for drinks. Um, and they also um could pay off the cops and they also um could pay off the cops to make the cops turn a blind eye. Uh, to make the cops turn a blind eye. Uh, in exchange, the cops were allowed to in exchange, the cops were allowed to come and raid these bars, usually about come and raid these bars, usually about once a month, and arrest anybody who was once a month, and arrest anybody who was breaking the law so they could reach breaking the law so they could reach their quotas. Everybody was happy except their quotas. Everybody was happy except for the people inside the for the people inside the Stonewall. So what happened on June Stonewall. So what happened on June 28th, 1969 is that for reasons that are 28th, 1969 is that for reasons that are still kind of mercurial and apocryphal, still kind of mercurial and apocryphal, the people who were under arrest at the the people who were under arrest at the Stonewall during one of these routine Stonewall during one of these routine police raids decided to fight back. And police raids decided to fight back. And as they fought back, the crowd outside as they fought back, the crowd outside Stonewall grew to the point that the Stonewall grew to the point that the police actually had to go inside police actually had to go inside Stonewall and barricade themselves. This Stonewall and barricade themselves. This was the first really publicly visible was the first really publicly visible sign of homosexuals fighting back sign of homosexuals fighting back against the authorities. But one thing I against the authorities. But one thing I want you to notice is the drastically want you to notice is the drastically different socioeconomic and demographic different socioeconomic and demographic appearance of the kids who took place in appearance of the kids who took place in the Stonewall riots as are shown in this the Stonewall riots as are shown in this photo here. While Julius's was a place photo here. While Julius's was a place where you could go and it was just a bar where you could go and it was just a bar and it was a lot of white men in suits and it was a lot of white men in suits who otherwise when they left Julius's who otherwise when they left Julius's pass for mainstream society outside the pass for mainstream society outside the doors of Julius's Stonewall as an doors of Julius's Stonewall as an explicitly gay mob owned bar tended to explicitly gay mob owned bar tended to cater to people who could not escape cater to people who could not escape into society. These were a lot of into society. These were a lot of non-white people, gender non-conforming non-white people, gender non-conforming people, a lot of sex workers coming in people, a lot of sex workers coming in from the docks on the waterfront who from the docks on the waterfront who found community in a place that left found community in a place that left them vulnerable to constant arrest and them vulnerable to constant arrest and harassment. And uh and so that's why you harassment. And uh and so that's why you see two completely different reactions see two completely different reactions to police and governmental oppression to police and governmental oppression just one block apart at two bars that just one block apart at two bars that are today kind of part of the same West are today kind of part of the same West Village gay bar community. Julius says Village gay bar community. Julius says they had kind of the social structure to they had kind of the social structure to fight back incrementally through the fight back incrementally through the legal system. At Stonewall, the people legal system. At Stonewall, the people being oppressed were the kinds who being oppressed were the kinds who really had no other way to fight back. really had no other way to fight back. And so you see uh what came to be known And so you see uh what came to be known as the Stonewall riots as a more violent as the Stonewall riots as a more violent version of the sipin that took place at version of the sipin that took place at Julius's just 3 years earlier and a Julius's just 3 years earlier and a block block block away. The issue is, and this is maybe a away. The issue is, and this is maybe a little controversial for me to say, but little controversial for me to say, but hang with me, is that after the hang with me, is that after the Stonewall riots, unlike the aftermath of Stonewall riots, unlike the aftermath of the Senate and Julius's, the laws did the Senate and Julius's, the laws did not immediately begin to change. And not immediately begin to change. And worse yet, the Stonewall Inn as a bar worse yet, the Stonewall Inn as a bar was shut down almost immediately. You was shut down almost immediately. You can see it here in the 1980s operating can see it here in the 1980s operating as a split bagel shop and Chinese as a split bagel shop and Chinese restaurant. Um, police raids continued restaurant. Um, police raids continued to uh be executed on gay bars around the to uh be executed on gay bars around the neighborhood. Um, including one just 8 neighborhood. Um, including one just 8 months after the Stonewall riots. And months after the Stonewall riots. And hold that thought cuz we'll come back to hold that thought cuz we'll come back to it. First, we're going to cross 7th it. First, we're going to cross 7th Avenue. Walking west across Christopher Avenue. Walking west across Christopher Street, you cross through this really Street, you cross through this really confusing intersection here that I've confusing intersection here that I've got on the right side of the screen. uh got on the right side of the screen. uh where Grove and Christopher and West 4th where Grove and Christopher and West 4th and Washington Place and 7th Avenue all and Washington Place and 7th Avenue all come together in a tangle of about seven come together in a tangle of about seven different directions. 7th Avenue is that different directions. 7th Avenue is that one street in the West Village that does one street in the West Village that does not feel like it makes sense. And the not feel like it makes sense. And the reason for that is that it was not reason for that is that it was not supposed to be there. 7th Avenue supposed to be there. 7th Avenue originally ended up at Greenwich Avenue. originally ended up at Greenwich Avenue. It did not cross through Greenwich It did not cross through Greenwich Village. You had Barrack Street to the Village. You had Barrack Street to the south and you have 7th Avenue to the south and you have 7th Avenue to the north. The center of Greenwich Village north. The center of Greenwich Village was not biseected by this road. That was not biseected by this road. That didn't change until the 19s when the didn't change until the 19s when the city decided they wanted a westside a city decided they wanted a westside a lower westside subway line, an extension lower westside subway line, an extension of the one, what's now the one, two, and of the one, what's now the one, two, and three train on the upper west side. It three train on the upper west side. It turned at Times Square to the east. It turned at Times Square to the east. It did not run down the west side of the did not run down the west side of the island, and they wanted a subway line island, and they wanted a subway line down the west side. Additionally, they down the west side. Additionally, they wanted to cut open Greenwich Village to wanted to cut open Greenwich Village to automobile traffic to make it easier to automobile traffic to make it easier to get cars from Midtown down to the then get cars from Midtown down to the then under construction Holland Tunnel. So under construction Holland Tunnel. So there was every reason for the city to there was every reason for the city to use whatever powers they had to crack use whatever powers they had to crack open Greenwich Village and its warrant open Greenwich Village and its warrant of confusing tightlyknit streets to the of confusing tightlyknit streets to the rest of the city for the first time. So rest of the city for the first time. So the city used eminent domain uh to take the city used eminent domain uh to take more than 300 properties in the path of more than 300 properties in the path of a new street and subway line, demolish a new street and subway line, demolish them and slice Greenwich Village open. them and slice Greenwich Village open. The most famous of the buildings taken The most famous of the buildings taken during this time was an apartment during this time was an apartment building called the Vorhees. I building called the Vorhees. I apologize, this is in all my years of apologize, this is in all my years of research the only photo I've ever found research the only photo I've ever found of the Vorhees. Uh this view is looking of the Vorhees. Uh this view is looking west across what's now Christopher Park west across what's now Christopher Park in front of the stone wall. You can see in front of the stone wall. You can see the stables that would become the stone the stables that would become the stone wall here on the right of the photo. Um wall here on the right of the photo. Um and the trees in the middle where the and the trees in the middle where the statue of Sheridan is today. Um but that statue of Sheridan is today. Um but that little roof line you see sticking over little roof line you see sticking over the trees back there is an apartment the trees back there is an apartment called the Vorhees that at the turn of called the Vorhees that at the turn of the 20th century was owned by a the 20th century was owned by a Philadelphiaian man uh named David Hess. Philadelphiaian man uh named David Hess. David Hess did not feel the city was David Hess did not feel the city was giving him a fair shake on the price of giving him a fair shake on the price of his building and taking it at to to his building and taking it at to to build this new avenue. He fought the build this new avenue. He fought the city for years and ultimately lost city for years and ultimately lost having to give up his building. And it having to give up his building. And it pictured on this map right here was pictured on this map right here was demolished along with dozens and dozens demolished along with dozens and dozens of other buildings in the heart of of other buildings in the heart of Greenwich Village to build 7th Avenue. Greenwich Village to build 7th Avenue. To give you some idea of the scale of To give you some idea of the scale of destruction, I've again crudely drawn destruction, I've again crudely drawn black lines through the middle of this black lines through the middle of this early map of Greenwich Village. Every early map of Greenwich Village. Every building in the middle of those two building in the middle of those two black lines was swept away to build 7th black lines was swept away to build 7th Avenue through the middle of Greenwich Avenue through the middle of Greenwich Village. This is a photo of that Village. This is a photo of that demolition. This is looking north from demolition. This is looking north from about Barrack Street or near I think about Barrack Street or near I think Grove Street uh of 7th Avenue. You can Grove Street uh of 7th Avenue. You can see just block after block of see just block after block of destruction and demolition and destruction and demolition and digging. But when the dust settled and digging. But when the dust settled and the new subway line and the new avenue the new subway line and the new avenue opened up, David Hess ordered all of the opened up, David Hess ordered all of the paperwork associated with the paperwork associated with the acquisition of his land. And when he acquisition of his land. And when he looked closely at it, what he realized looked closely at it, what he realized is that the city had made a mistake in is that the city had made a mistake in accidentally leaving off about an 18-in accidentally leaving off about an 18-in triangle at the corner of the Vorhees, triangle at the corner of the Vorhees, which he still technically owned. He which he still technically owned. He then filed a notice of retention to the then filed a notice of retention to the city, was granted it uh with the land uh city, was granted it uh with the land uh appraised at about $1,000, and rather appraised at about $1,000, and rather than sell it or give it back to the than sell it or give it back to the city, he hired a mosaicist to make a city, he hired a mosaicist to make a plaque that he that is still embedded in plaque that he that is still embedded in the sidewalk where he previously owned the sidewalk where he previously owned the land that reads property of the Hess the land that reads property of the Hess estate, which has never been dedicated estate, which has never been dedicated for public purposes. This sits in front for public purposes. This sits in front of the old village cigar building, so of the old village cigar building, so you can go visit it today. Now, from that triangle and today. Now, from that triangle and understanding why that part of the understanding why that part of the village feels so strange, we're going to village feels so strange, we're going to continue our walk um up uh Christopher continue our walk um up uh Christopher Street to Bleecker Street and take a Street to Bleecker Street and take a right and go up one block to the corner right and go up one block to the corner of Bleecker and 10th where there's this of Bleecker and 10th where there's this unassuming apartment building today. The unassuming apartment building today. The corner store is now occupied by a fyard corner store is now occupied by a fyard clothing store. But if you look at this clothing store. But if you look at this photo just left of the arched entryway, photo just left of the arched entryway, you'll see a little railing that would you'll see a little railing that would lead down into the basement. In the lead down into the basement. In the 1960s, contemporaneous with uh the 1960s, contemporaneous with uh the Stonewall and uh Julius's, there was a Stonewall and uh Julius's, there was a gay-owned after hours gay bar in the gay-owned after hours gay bar in the basement of this building called kind of basement of this building called kind of cheekily the snake pit. This is where cheekily the snake pit. This is where men would come when all the other bars men would come when all the other bars closed at night. 8 months after the closed at night. 8 months after the events at Stonewall, the same police events at Stonewall, the same police captain from the same police precinct captain from the same police precinct came to execute a raid against the gay came to execute a raid against the gay people inside the snake pit. This time people inside the snake pit. This time he did not want to risk another riot he did not want to risk another riot breaking out. So he brought his entire breaking out. So he brought his entire battalion with him and they decided to battalion with him and they decided to arrest everybody found inside the snake arrest everybody found inside the snake pit. So 167 men were marched up those pit. So 167 men were marched up those stairs and around to the precinct house stairs and around to the precinct house on Charles Street. There they were put on Charles Street. There they were put in a holding cell and left to await in a holding cell and left to await their fate for many hours. And among their fate for many hours. And among this group there was a very fearful this group there was a very fearful 23-year-old Argentine immigrant by the 23-year-old Argentine immigrant by the name of Diego Vignales who knew that name of Diego Vignales who knew that homosexuals were not allowed inside the homosexuals were not allowed inside the country at the time. So if he was country at the time. So if he was deported, he'd never be allowed to come deported, he'd never be allowed to come back in because that would be on his back in because that would be on his record. So fearful of what would happen record. So fearful of what would happen to him, he fled from the holding cell to him, he fled from the holding cell where they were and found a loose window where they were and found a loose window at the back of the precinct house, which at the back of the precinct house, which he pushed out and tried to jump from the he pushed out and tried to jump from the precinct house onto a house behind it. precinct house onto a house behind it. But he slipped and fell down between the But he slipped and fell down between the buildings, landing on a spiked fence in buildings, landing on a spiked fence in the alley, right? He did survive. We the alley, right? He did survive. We know that much about him, though much of know that much about him, though much of his life afterward is a mystery. Um, and his life afterward is a mystery. Um, and I have censored this photo, but this is I have censored this photo, but this is a news photo. You can just see his head a news photo. You can just see his head poking out um while they're trying to poking out um while they're trying to save him from the fence. Ultimately, the save him from the fence. Ultimately, the fire department had to come and cut the fire department had to come and cut the fence off with him on it and bring him fence off with him on it and bring him all bring the fence with him on it to all bring the fence with him on it to St. Vincent's Hospital where he St. Vincent's Hospital where he underwent about 24 hours of surgery. underwent about 24 hours of surgery. Importantly, during that time, rumors Importantly, during that time, rumors spread through the village that Diego spread through the village that Diego had died. And so, organizations like the had died. And so, organizations like the Gay Activist Alliance rallied people to Gay Activist Alliance rallied people to hold a protest march and death bitchel hold a protest march and death bitchel through the village outside the police through the village outside the police precinct house and St. Vincent's precinct house and St. Vincent's Hospital. This is one of their um uh Hospital. This is one of their um uh flyers trying to get people to rally. flyers trying to get people to rally. What's important about this is that at What's important about this is that at this time, members of organizations like this time, members of organizations like the Gay Activist Alliance had been the Gay Activist Alliance had been trying to rally support for a trying to rally support for a commemorative march honoring the commemorative march honoring the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. But anniversary of the Stonewall riots. But because so little had fundamentally because so little had fundamentally changed for the queer community of changed for the queer community of Greenwich Village at that time, support Greenwich Village at that time, support was flagging. to put it politely. Um it was flagging. to put it politely. Um it was the riots and rallies and protest was the riots and rallies and protest vigils in the aftermath of what happened vigils in the aftermath of what happened to Diego at the snake pit that helped to Diego at the snake pit that helped rally enough support that just months rally enough support that just months after this event, the Gay Activist after this event, the Gay Activist Alliance and other groups like them will Alliance and other groups like them will successfully stage what is now known as successfully stage what is now known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day the Christopher Street Liberation Day march. Essentially the world's first gay march. Essentially the world's first gay pride parade, which is why Pride is pride parade, which is why Pride is still held in June every year and it's still held in June every year and it's why we commemorate the Stonewall. But why we commemorate the Stonewall. But tangentially, the reason it was so tangentially, the reason it was so successful and the reason Stonewall is successful and the reason Stonewall is so well remembered is in part because of so well remembered is in part because of the events at the Snake Pit eight months the events at the Snake Pit eight months later. But while the Stonewall is now a later. But while the Stonewall is now a national monument with a visitors center national monument with a visitors center and and you can get your national park and and you can get your national park passport stamped at the bar, the Snake passport stamped at the bar, the Snake Pit has no plaque, no commemoration Pit has no plaque, no commemoration whatsoever, it has reverted to being whatsoever, it has reverted to being just a basement under a Ferty store. just a basement under a Ferty store. That helps kind of bring the arc that That helps kind of bring the arc that started with the Julius Sipin in 1966 started with the Julius Sipin in 1966 through to its conclusion as the kind of through to its conclusion as the kind of more more more formative push back against authority formative push back against authority coming out of Greenwich Village during coming out of Greenwich Village during the queer liberation movement really the queer liberation movement really began to reach a fever began to reach a fever pitch. Now from the former snake bit pitch. Now from the former snake bit location, we're going to go up a block location, we're going to go up a block on Bleecker, turn left on Charles Street on Bleecker, turn left on Charles Street to take a look at the weirdest house in to take a look at the weirdest house in Greenwich Village, a title I do not Greenwich Village, a title I do not bestow lightly, but I have yet to have bestow lightly, but I have yet to have anybody push back against that or anybody push back against that or nominate a house that is any weirder nominate a house that is any weirder than this. number 121 Charles Street at than this. number 121 Charles Street at the corner of Charles and Greenwich the corner of Charles and Greenwich Street is a singularly strange house and Street is a singularly strange house and its story is even better than that its story is even better than that because weird as it is and as much as it because weird as it is and as much as it feels like a part of the village, it feels like a part of the village, it feels very villagy, it is not from the feels very villagy, it is not from the village. This house was originally a village. This house was originally a rear rental property behind a little rear rental property behind a little brick Italian 8 townhouse at number 1335 brick Italian 8 townhouse at number 1335 York Avenue pictured here on the left. York Avenue pictured here on the left. That's the front house. The house that's That's the front house. The house that's now 121 Charles would sit behind it, now 121 Charles would sit behind it, separated by a little stone courtyard, separated by a little stone courtyard, earning this rear house the nickname earning this rear house the nickname Cobble Court, which earned some fame in Cobble Court, which earned some fame in 1943 when it was rented for the next 1943 when it was rented for the next decade by the woman pictured here in the decade by the woman pictured here in the doorway on the right, the children's doorway on the right, the children's book author Margaret Wise Brown, who book author Margaret Wise Brown, who used that rear house on York Avenue as used that rear house on York Avenue as her writing studio. So it was out of her writing studio. So it was out of this house over a decade that she wrote this house over a decade that she wrote roughly a hundred children's books, roughly a hundred children's books, including her opus, Goodn Night Moon. So including her opus, Goodn Night Moon. So goodn night moon was written in this goodn night moon was written in this house but not in the village when it was house but not in the village when it was up on York Avenue. Margaret Weiss Brown up on York Avenue. Margaret Weiss Brown suffered a rather igniminious death. She suffered a rather igniminious death. She was on a ski trip in Switzerland had to was on a ski trip in Switzerland had to undergo an emergency appendecttomy when undergo an emergency appendecttomy when the surgery was successfully over that a the surgery was successfully over that a nurse came in to ask her how she was nurse came in to ask her how she was feeling. And to show how good she felt feeling. And to show how good she felt she did a high kick in her hospital bed she did a high kick in her hospital bed which dislodged a blood clot which which dislodged a blood clot which killed her. So Margaret Wise Brown, now killed her. So Margaret Wise Brown, now deceased, was no longer occupying her deceased, was no longer occupying her studio on New York Avenue, and the studio on New York Avenue, and the family that owned it allowed it to sit family that owned it allowed it to sit empty and unoccupied for almost a decade empty and unoccupied for almost a decade thereafter. The house became basically thereafter. The house became basically uninhabitable, and in the early 1960s, uninhabitable, and in the early 1960s, the family rented it to a Swedish the family rented it to a Swedish immigrant named Sven Burnernhard, who immigrant named Sven Burnernhard, who agreed to a really low rental price in agreed to a really low rental price in exchange for fixing the house up for exchange for fixing the house up for himself with his own money. While he was himself with his own money. While he was fixing it up, he married another Swedish fixing it up, he married another Swedish immigrant named Ingred, and Ingred and immigrant named Ingred, and Ingred and Sven made this their home. But just as Sven made this their home. But just as they were putting the finishing touches they were putting the finishing touches on it in 1965 or '66, the family that on it in 1965 or '66, the family that owned it announced that they were going owned it announced that they were going to sell the whole thing to the Catholic to sell the whole thing to the Catholic Arch Dascese of New York who was tearing Arch Dascese of New York who was tearing down the block to build a retirement down the block to build a retirement home tower. So the Burnhards went to home tower. So the Burnhards went to court suing that they had paid so much court suing that they had paid so much money to fix this house up that they money to fix this house up that they should own it and the court sided with should own it and the court sided with them. They now owned the house but not them. They now owned the house but not the land it sat on. So it was up to the the land it sat on. So it was up to the Burnharts to figure out what to do with Burnharts to figure out what to do with this house. So the first thing was to this house. So the first thing was to find a place for it to go. And what they find a place for it to go. And what they found was an empty lot at the corner of found was an empty lot at the corner of Charles and Greenwich that was very Charles and Greenwich that was very cheap because two tenementss had just cheap because two tenementss had just collapsed there. So they got that corner collapsed there. So they got that corner lot. They then had to cut through about lot. They then had to cut through about a dozen layers of red tape to get the a dozen layers of red tape to get the house actually moved. Finally, Mayor house actually moved. Finally, Mayor John Lindseay entered the frey to help John Lindseay entered the frey to help them cut through the red tape and in uh them cut through the red tape and in uh a rather miraculous turn of events, the a rather miraculous turn of events, the house was loaded onto a flatbed truck, house was loaded onto a flatbed truck, hauled down York Avenue to 57th Street, hauled down York Avenue to 57th Street, across 57th to Second, down Second across 57th to Second, down Second Avenue to 14th Street, across 14th Avenue to 14th Street, across 14th Street to the Meatacking District where Street to the Meatacking District where it wended its way down to the corner of it wended its way down to the corner of Charles and Greenwich where it was Charles and Greenwich where it was placed to the celebration of residents placed to the celebration of residents of the neighbor. Here you can see them of the neighbor. Here you can see them holding a banner that says Burnernhard holding a banner that says Burnernhard Homestead. Welcome to Greenwich Homestead. Welcome to Greenwich Village. The Burnhards remained in this Village. The Burnhards remained in this house until the 1980s when they retired house until the 1980s when they retired to Connecticut. The house was then sold to Connecticut. The house was then sold to a family who had young children, and to a family who had young children, and it's they who added the wonky wings to it's they who added the wonky wings to the east and west of the house, but the east and west of the house, but keeping the spirit of the house's kind keeping the spirit of the house's kind of cockeyed of cockeyed of cockeyed appearance. Now, from that corner, from appearance. Now, from that corner, from that house, we're going to head down that house, we're going to head down Greenwich Street, where there used to Greenwich Street, where there used to run an elevated train. When we reach run an elevated train. When we reach Christopher Street, there's an old piece Christopher Street, there's an old piece of history that's been largely forgotten of history that's been largely forgotten in Greenwich Village. From Christopher in Greenwich Village. From Christopher to Charles Lane on the Hudson River on to Charles Lane on the Hudson River on the west side of the island once stood the west side of the island once stood the state of New York's first official the state of New York's first official state prison called New Gate. It was state prison called New Gate. It was technologically and society a huge technologically and society a huge advancement for prison uh at the time. advancement for prison uh at the time. It was an extremely modern prison. Um it It was an extremely modern prison. Um it also helped with the overcrowding issues also helped with the overcrowding issues that the city faced down near the the that the city faced down near the the courouses in the southern end of the courouses in the southern end of the island. Um, and we think this is where island. Um, and we think this is where the phrase send them up the river comes the phrase send them up the river comes from because once this prison opened, from because once this prison opened, when someone was convicted of a crime when someone was convicted of a crime down at the courouses downtown, they down at the courouses downtown, they would be sent up the Hudson River to New would be sent up the Hudson River to New Gate Prison. As Greenwich Village became Gate Prison. As Greenwich Village became more prosperous in the 1820s and 30s, more prosperous in the 1820s and 30s, this is just a floor plan of the prison. this is just a floor plan of the prison. Uh, wealthy residents moving to Uh, wealthy residents moving to Greenwich Village didn't want a prison Greenwich Village didn't want a prison on their waterfront. So, the prison was on their waterfront. So, the prison was shut down, replaced by a new state shut down, replaced by a new state prison up at Osing. And so, this prison prison up at Osing. And so, this prison was swept away. All that's left of it is was swept away. All that's left of it is little stonecovered Charles Lane, which little stonecovered Charles Lane, which used to mark the northern boundary of used to mark the northern boundary of the prison and is still there the prison and is still there today. Um, but Christopher Street, if today. Um, but Christopher Street, if you remember, now we're going to cross you remember, now we're going to cross to the south side of it. Christopher to the south side of it. Christopher Street also marks the dividing line Street also marks the dividing line between the straight lines of the Warren between the straight lines of the Warren Estate to the north and the crooked Estate to the north and the crooked lines of the Trinity parcel and Richmond lines of the Trinity parcel and Richmond Hill parcel to the south of it. So once Hill parcel to the south of it. So once you cross north or south of Christopher you cross north or south of Christopher Street, you notice an almost immediate Street, you notice an almost immediate shift in the architectural uh feel and shift in the architectural uh feel and streetscape of the two halves of streetscape of the two halves of Greenwich Village. The southern half has Greenwich Village. The southern half has all the bent streets and the streets all the bent streets and the streets tend to be much tend to be much narrower. Um so we're going to wind our narrower. Um so we're going to wind our way through a few of those really way through a few of those really quickly, including this very fascinating quickly, including this very fascinating little pocket of one of these bent little pocket of one of these bent streets. Because where the property streets. Because where the property lines meet on the southern side of lines meet on the southern side of Greenwich Village, they often didn't Greenwich Village, they often didn't meet very neatly and they leave these meet very neatly and they leave these awkward gaps between the two rows of awkward gaps between the two rows of houses developed by differing property houses developed by differing property owners. On Grove Street, that wedge sat owners. On Grove Street, that wedge sat empty for years after the rows of houses empty for years after the rows of houses were built to the left and right of it, were built to the left and right of it, leaving this kind of open pies-shaped leaving this kind of open pies-shaped wedge of land that no one knew what to wedge of land that no one knew what to do with. It's called a gore lot. um a do with. It's called a gore lot. um a local market owner decided to buy the local market owner decided to buy the gore lot along with the backyards of all gore lot along with the backyards of all the houses next to it and into that the houses next to it and into that build six little town build six little town houses that are now called Grove Court, houses that are now called Grove Court, but they were not always so desirable as but they were not always so desirable as they are now. These originally had they are now. These originally had nicknames such as mixed ale alley nicknames such as mixed ale alley because it was home to mostly brewers because it was home to mostly brewers who would bring home mixed batches of who would bring home mixed batches of beer that hadn't been bottled that day. beer that hadn't been bottled that day. So, the whole area just stung like stale So, the whole area just stung like stale beer. Um it was also sometimes called beer. Um it was also sometimes called Pig Alley for the pigs that would roam Pig Alley for the pigs that would roam the courtyard eating the garbage. But the courtyard eating the garbage. But I've outlined it on the map here on the I've outlined it on the map here on the left and you can see how genius it was left and you can see how genius it was that they squeezed a halfozen homes into that they squeezed a halfozen homes into what was otherwise a useless piece of what was otherwise a useless piece of land. Um, these during Greenwich land. Um, these during Greenwich Village's first Bohemian era in the Village's first Bohemian era in the early 20th century were given their cute early 20th century were given their cute little gateway and the nickname Grove little gateway and the nickname Grove Court to make them sound a bit nicer Court to make them sound a bit nicer than their previous identity as Mixed than their previous identity as Mixed Ale Ale Ale Alley. Looping around uh taking Barrow Alley. Looping around uh taking Barrow Street to Commerce Street pass places Street to Commerce Street pass places like the Cherry Lane Theater. But what I like the Cherry Lane Theater. But what I want to point out here is at the corner want to point out here is at the corner of Bedford and Commerce, this beautiful of Bedford and Commerce, this beautiful house here at the corner is actually the house here at the corner is actually the oldest structure in Greenwich Village, oldest structure in Greenwich Village, the oldest known one. This was built as the oldest known one. This was built as a house in 1799, making it one of just a a house in 1799, making it one of just a handful of 18th century buildings in all handful of 18th century buildings in all of Manhattan today. It's called the of Manhattan today. It's called the Isaac's Hendricks House. And my favorite Isaac's Hendricks House. And my favorite thing about it is he's got these two odd thing about it is he's got these two odd brick cutouts on the sidewall there on brick cutouts on the sidewall there on the Commerce Street side of the house. the Commerce Street side of the house. That's because that's where the That's because that's where the fireplaces are inside and they didn't fireplaces are inside and they didn't want the heat of the fireplace to burn want the heat of the fireplace to burn the outside of the house. More the outside of the house. More interestingly is that next to the Isaac interestingly is that next to the Isaac Hendricks house used to be a little Hendricks house used to be a little carriageway to lead to the back of the carriageway to lead to the back of the house. By the 1890s, that carriageway house. By the 1890s, that carriageway wasn't in use anymore. And so, a wasn't in use anymore. And so, a developer decided to fill in that little developer decided to fill in that little narrow piece of unused land with what is narrow piece of unused land with what is now the city's narrowest house. You can now the city's narrowest house. You can see it here on the left and the right. see it here on the left and the right. Um, that house number 75 and a half Um, that house number 75 and a half Bedford Street is the narrowest house, I Bedford Street is the narrowest house, I believe, in all of New York City. believe, in all of New York City. Definitely the narrowest in Manhattan. From there, we go down to what is an From there, we go down to what is an extension of Loy Street here called St. extension of Loy Street here called St. Luke's Place. This bent block um is Luke's Place. This bent block um is named in honor of St. Luke's Church in named in honor of St. Luke's Church in the Field, which is just a couple blocks the Field, which is just a couple blocks away. Named Church in the Field because away. Named Church in the Field because when St. Luke's was built in the 1820s, when St. Luke's was built in the 1820s, it actually sat in the middle of fields. it actually sat in the middle of fields. Um though now it's right in the middle Um though now it's right in the middle of Greenwich Village. But as more and of Greenwich Village. But as more and more people moved to Greenwich Village more people moved to Greenwich Village permanently, one of the kind of ugly permanently, one of the kind of ugly sides of having permanent life in a sides of having permanent life in a place is you also need a place for your place is you also need a place for your dead. And so a cemetery was established dead. And so a cemetery was established for St. Luke's and the other for St. Luke's and the other Episcopalians of Greenwich Village right Episcopalians of Greenwich Village right where Hudson Street and Loy Street or where Hudson Street and Loy Street or St. Luke's Place intersect. And that St. Luke's Place intersect. And that cemetery was in use for about 60 years cemetery was in use for about 60 years from 1834 to 1898. This is uh one of the from 1834 to 1898. This is uh one of the few photos that exists of that cemetery few photos that exists of that cemetery when it was still active. By the 1890s, when it was still active. By the 1890s, it was overgrown. It wasn't really being it was overgrown. It wasn't really being used for burials anymore. So the city used for burials anymore. So the city ordered it um covered up and transformed ordered it um covered up and transformed into a park called Hudson Park. The into a park called Hudson Park. The architecture was designed by the architecture was designed by the architectural firm of Carrer and architectural firm of Carrer and Hastings, the same architects who Hastings, the same architects who designed uh the New York Public Library designed uh the New York Public Library and um the Frick Collection. All that's and um the Frick Collection. All that's left at this Carer and Hastings Park is left at this Carer and Hastings Park is the beautiful stone iron fence that now the beautiful stone iron fence that now encircles what is now called James J. encircles what is now called James J. Walker Park. But what most people don't Walker Park. But what most people don't know is that James J. Walker Park down know is that James J. Walker Park down near Hston Street, still very popular near Hston Street, still very popular with soccer and baseball with a with soccer and baseball with a playground and a swimming pool and Keith playground and a swimming pool and Keith Herring murals, still has about 15,000 Herring murals, still has about 15,000 bodies underneath it. bodies underneath it. because this was at the edge of because this was at the edge of Greenwich Village. Um it sat just north Greenwich Village. Um it sat just north of the Manetta Brook, the river that of the Manetta Brook, the river that formed the southern boundary of formed the southern boundary of Greenwich Village. And so for the last Greenwich Village. And so for the last leg of our tour, we're going to jump leg of our tour, we're going to jump onto the route of that river. Uh the onto the route of that river. Uh the Manetta Brook roughly followed what is Manetta Brook roughly followed what is now um uh West Hson Street, Downing now um uh West Hson Street, Downing Street, Mc um uh Manetta Lane or Manetta Street, Mc um uh Manetta Lane or Manetta Street, sorry, and McDougall Street on Street, sorry, and McDougall Street on its way up to Chelsea. So, we'll hug its way up to Chelsea. So, we'll hug that as closely as we can, ending at the that as closely as we can, ending at the northwest corner of Washington Square, northwest corner of Washington Square, where stands a tree so large that if you where stands a tree so large that if you just walk by it, you may not even notice just walk by it, you may not even notice it because the first branches don't it because the first branches don't start until about four stories above the start until about four stories above the ground. This nicknamed Elma or the ground. This nicknamed Elma or the hangman's elm, though it is not guilty hangman's elm, though it is not guilty of any hangman in any documented of any hangman in any documented history, um is thought to be the oldest history, um is thought to be the oldest tree in Manhattan, about 350 years old. tree in Manhattan, about 350 years old. It is, interestingly, not a native tree. It is, interestingly, not a native tree. It is an English elm, which is part of It is an English elm, which is part of the reason why it was able to survive the reason why it was able to survive the great elm blight of the 20th the great elm blight of the 20th century. But that means that some early century. But that means that some early European settler of Greenwich Village European settler of Greenwich Village planted this whether on purpose or by planted this whether on purpose or by mistake on the banks of the Manetta mistake on the banks of the Manetta brook 350 years ago. So everything that brook 350 years ago. So everything that we've talked about, the entire history we've talked about, the entire history of New York, uh that's the tree there on of New York, uh that's the tree there on the right today, this tree has lived the right today, this tree has lived through and borne witness to. It was a through and borne witness to. It was a hundred years old when George Washington hundred years old when George Washington was inaugurated as our first president. was inaugurated as our first president. It was close to 200 years old when the It was close to 200 years old when the civil war broke out. It's lived through civil war broke out. It's lived through every undulation of wealth and poverty every undulation of wealth and poverty in Greenwich Village and the city. The in Greenwich Village and the city. The whole Bohemian movement, the beatnic whole Bohemian movement, the beatnic movement, the queer liberation movement, movement, the queer liberation movement, modern gentrification trials and modern gentrification trials and travailes. Uh, this tree is still travailes. Uh, this tree is still leafing out today. And so, I'd love to leafing out today. And so, I'd love to end the tour on something that is end the tour on something that is literally a living legacy of everything literally a living legacy of everything I've just rambled at you about. Um, but I've just rambled at you about. Um, but with that, that is all I have for you. I with that, that is all I have for you. I hope I'm not too far over time and I hope I'm not too far over time and I thank you for We still have some time for a few We still have some time for a few questions. Yeah. Do we want to do a Q&amp;A? questions. Yeah. Do we want to do a Q&amp;A? You want to raise your hands and we'll You want to raise your hands and we'll point. Anybody have any questions? Don't point. Anybody have any questions? Don't be shy. Yes. Do you really pronounce it be shy. Yes. Do you really pronounce it Leroy and not Leroy? So the original Leroy and not Leroy? So the original name was it was a family name of French name was it was a family name of French Even. So they were Leoy. Two words. Wow. Even. So they were Leoy. Two words. Wow. Leroy makes it sound a little more banjo Leroy makes it sound a little more banjo plucky. No offense to anybody's name plucky. No offense to anybody's name Leroy. It's great. But but yes, it's Leroy. It's great. But but yes, it's historically would be Leroy. Yes. Did historically would be Leroy. Yes. Did your book talk about Shamley's this your book talk about Shamley's this famous speak easy? I think I mention it. famous speak easy? I think I mention it. I think I mentioned the the purported I think I mentioned the the purported tunnel between it and the wooden house. tunnel between it and the wooden house. Go into it. Yeah, I didn't on this. I Go into it. Yeah, I didn't on this. I couldn't fit everything into this talk couldn't fit everything into this talk or we'd be here all night. But yeah, it or we'd be here all night. But yeah, it does get a shout out. Yes. Keith, does get a shout out. Yes. Keith, outside of the Greenwich Village tour, outside of the Greenwich Village tour, what are other tours that you would say what are other tours that you would say are not required reading, but like top are not required reading, but like top hits for someone who has lived in New hits for someone who has lived in New York for a while, especially in the York for a while, especially in the Greenwich Village area? Yes. So, on the Greenwich Village area? Yes. So, on the one hand, if you want like sexy history, one hand, if you want like sexy history, my guilded age tours and the Gilded Age my guilded age tours and the Gilded Age chapters in my book are a must readad. chapters in my book are a must readad. Um, they are the only tours that are not Um, they are the only tours that are not based around specific neighborhoods in based around specific neighborhoods in the book. Uh, they are based more on a the book. Uh, they are based more on a time period. and my Gilded Age, Gilded time period. and my Gilded Age, Gilded Age, old money versus new money and Age, old money versus new money and Gilded Age Upper East Side tours, take Gilded Age Upper East Side tours, take you through the whole span of the Gilded you through the whole span of the Gilded Age from its origins through its end in Age from its origins through its end in the 20th century, helping to unpack not the 20th century, helping to unpack not just the parties and the pretty just the parties and the pretty architecture, but what the Gilded Age architecture, but what the Gilded Age meant socially for the city's evolution meant socially for the city's evolution and really for the country's evolution. and really for the country's evolution. Um, other than that, one I always Um, other than that, one I always recommend to people is kind of like a a recommend to people is kind of like a a slow burn is Central Park because I slow burn is Central Park because I think similar to Greenwich Village, a think similar to Greenwich Village, a lot of people think they know Central lot of people think they know Central Park. They love Central Park, but they Park. They love Central Park, but they really have no idea of what they're really have no idea of what they're actually experiencing. Uh, the way that actually experiencing. Uh, the way that I I love to say that it's really I I love to say that it's really Frederick Law Homestead is manipulating Frederick Law Homestead is manipulating your experience at every turn when you your experience at every turn when you walk through the park. Everything that walk through the park. Everything that you're experiencing in the park is as you're experiencing in the park is as far from natural as you can really get far from natural as you can really get because Frederick Law Homestead planned because Frederick Law Homestead planned for you to feel this way, to experience for you to feel this way, to experience this, to walk through the woods and get this, to walk through the woods and get lost here so you'd end up here. It's lost here so you'd end up here. It's genius the way he laid it out and genius the way he laid it out and getting to walk people through that and getting to walk people through that and getting them to see the park beyond just getting them to see the park beyond just the trees is really a joy for me. Any the trees is really a joy for me. Any other questions? Yes. Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry. That's Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry. That's okay. okay. okay. Who owns the wonky house now? I do not Who owns the wonky house now? I do not know, but they've got two really cute know, but they've got two really cute sharpes. sharpes. sharpes. Um, if anybody knows who they are, I Um, if anybody knows who they are, I would love an invite inside. But um, would love an invite inside. But um, Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know. Yes. When Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know. Yes. When you talk about a brownstone building, you talk about a brownstone building, that's just basically the the cladding that's just basically the the cladding kind of brick building, right? It's like kind of brick building, right? It's like what, 4 in, 6 in. Yeah. It depends on what, 4 in, 6 in. Yeah. It depends on the house, but they would usually apply the house, but they would usually apply it to make the house look like a stone it to make the house look like a stone house to sell at a higher price, which house to sell at a higher price, which was also part of the ploy and part of was also part of the ploy and part of the issue because to get that thin the issue because to get that thin layer, they'd usually cut on the, you layer, they'd usually cut on the, you know, with the bias and that means that know, with the bias and that means that the seams between the layers of stone the seams between the layers of stone are then open to water get pouring in. are then open to water get pouring in. So layers of it would literally slough So layers of it would literally slough off. You mean there are layers of grass off. You mean there are layers of grass stone? So layers within the stone. So stone? So layers within the stone. So it's it's almost like I say it's like a it's it's almost like I say it's like a meal foyer or like a croissant. Um and meal foyer or like a croissant. Um and so as the water gets in and freezes, it so as the water gets in and freezes, it expands it will pop a layer off like expands it will pop a layer off like this. Some buildings like the Episcopal this. Some buildings like the Episcopal Church Calvary at the corner of 21st and Church Calvary at the corner of 21st and Park is made of solid brownstone blocks Park is made of solid brownstone blocks rather than just that kind of veneer. So rather than just that kind of veneer. So most of its stones are laid the proper most of its stones are laid the proper way with the seams running this way way with the seams running this way rather than vertically. So, it has a rather than vertically. So, it has a harder time getting water inside. You harder time getting water inside. You still see damage. It's still It's still still see damage. It's still It's still in a lot of need of restoration, but in a lot of need of restoration, but it's not as bad as most brownstone it's not as bad as most brownstone houses. Most brownstone houses you see houses. Most brownstone houses you see today have already been repaired using today have already been repaired using cement and a kind of stucco material to cement and a kind of stucco material to mimic the look without falling apart mimic the look without falling apart like real brownstone. And one other like real brownstone. And one other quickie, uh, where does the word quickie, uh, where does the word mattisheen come from? So, Mattisheen, mattisheen come from? So, Mattisheen, and I'm probably going to butcher the and I'm probably going to butcher the details, but Matteen comes from like an details, but Matteen comes from like an old uh Arabian story of a Mattisheen or old uh Arabian story of a Mattisheen or a man wearing a mask. That's where the a man wearing a mask. That's where the the root of the word comes from, a the root of the word comes from, a masked man who because no one knew his masked man who because no one knew his identity could speak truth to the king. identity could speak truth to the king. That's the story. And so, this idea of That's the story.
