TRANSCRIPT:
----------------------------------------
You wrote somewhere that creating powerful&nbsp; AI might be the last invention humanity ever&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to make. How much time do we have, Ben? &nbsp; I think 50th percentile chance of hitting some&nbsp; kind of superintelligence is now like 2028. &nbsp; What is it that you saw at OpenAI? What'd you&nbsp; experience there that made you feel like, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; we got to go do our own thing? We felt like safety wasn't the top&nbsp;&nbsp; priority there. The case for safety&nbsp; has gotten a lot more concrete,&nbsp;&nbsp; so superintelligence is a lot about how do we&nbsp; keep God in a box and not let the God out? &nbsp; What are the odds that we align AI correctly? Once we get to superintelligence, it will be too&nbsp;&nbsp; late to align the models. My best granularity&nbsp; forecast for could we have an X-risk or extremely&nbsp;&nbsp; bad outcome is somewhere between 0 and 10%. Something that's in the news right now is this&nbsp;&nbsp; whole Zuck coming after all&nbsp; the top AI researchers, &nbsp; We've been much less affected because people&nbsp; here, they get these offers and then they say,&nbsp;&nbsp; well, of course I'm not going to leave because my&nbsp; best case scenario at Meta is that we make money&nbsp;&nbsp; and my best case scenario at Anthropic&nbsp; is we affect the future of humanity. &nbsp; Dario, your CEO recently talked about how&nbsp; unemployment might go up to something like 20%. &nbsp; If you just think about 20 years in the&nbsp; future where we're way past the singularity,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's hard for me to imagine that even capitalism&nbsp; will look at all like it looks today. &nbsp; Do you have any advice for folks that&nbsp; want to try to get ahead of this? &nbsp; I'm not immune to job replacement either.&nbsp; At some point it's coming for all of us. &nbsp; Today, my guest is Benjamin Mann. Holy moly.&nbsp; What a conversation. Ben is the co-founder of&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthropic. He serves as tech lead for product&nbsp; engineering. He focuses most of his time&nbsp;&nbsp; and energy on aligning AI to be helpful,&nbsp; harmless, and honest. Prior to Anthropic,&nbsp;&nbsp; he was one of the architects of GPT-3 at OpenAI.&nbsp; In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground,&nbsp;&nbsp; including his thoughts on the recruiting battle&nbsp; for top AI researchers, why he left OpenAI to&nbsp;&nbsp; start Anthropic, how soon he expects we'll see&nbsp; AGI. Also, his economic touring test for knowing&nbsp;&nbsp; when we've hit AGI, why scaling laws have not&nbsp; slowed down and are in fact accelerating and&nbsp;&nbsp; what the current biggest bottlenecks are. Why he's&nbsp; so deeply concerned with AI safety and how he and&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthropic operationalize safety and alignment&nbsp; into the models that they build and into their&nbsp;&nbsp; ways of working. Also, how the existential risk&nbsp; from AI has impacted his own perspectives on the&nbsp;&nbsp; world and his own life and what he's encouraging&nbsp; his kids to learn to succeed in an AI future. &nbsp; A huge thank you to Steve Mnich, Danielle&nbsp; Ghiglieri, Raph Lee, and my newsletter community&nbsp;&nbsp; for suggesting topics for this conversation.

This episode is brought to you by Sauce.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way teams turn feedback into product&nbsp; impact is stuck in the past. Vague reports,&nbsp;&nbsp; static taxonomies, unactionable insights that&nbsp; don't move business metrics. The results churn,&nbsp;&nbsp; lost deals, misgrowth. Sauce is the AI product&nbsp; co-pilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover&nbsp;&nbsp; business impact and act faster. It listens to&nbsp; your sales calls, support tickets, turn reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp; and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product&nbsp; issues and opportunities in real time. &nbsp; It then routes them to the right teams to turn&nbsp; signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code&nbsp;&nbsp; that drives revenue retention and adoption.&nbsp; That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Zip use Sauce. One enterprise uncovered a&nbsp; product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR, another&nbsp;&nbsp; caught a spiking issue and prevented millions in&nbsp; churn. You can too at sauce.app/lenny. Sauce built&nbsp;&nbsp; for AI product teams. Don't get left behind. This episode is brought to you by LucidLink,&nbsp;&nbsp; the storage collaboration platform. You've built a&nbsp; great product, but how you show it through video,&nbsp;&nbsp; design, and storytelling is what brings it to&nbsp; life. If your team works with large media files,&nbsp;&nbsp; videos, design assets, layer project&nbsp; files, you know how painful it can be&nbsp;&nbsp; to stay organized across locations, files live&nbsp; in different places. You're constantly asking,&nbsp;&nbsp; is this the latest version? Creative work slows&nbsp; down while people wait for files to transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp; LucidLink fixes this. It gives your team a shared&nbsp; space in the cloud that works like a local drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Files are instantly accessible for anywhere, no&nbsp; downloading, no syncing, and always up to date.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means producers, editors, designers, and&nbsp; marketers can open massive files in their native&nbsp;&nbsp; apps, work directly from the cloud, and stay&nbsp; aligned wherever they are.

Great to be here, Lenny. I have a billion and one questions for you. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; really excited to be chatting. I want to&nbsp; start with something that's very timely,&nbsp;&nbsp; something that's happening this week. Something&nbsp; that's in the news right now is this whole Zuck&nbsp;&nbsp; coming after all the top AI researchers offering&nbsp; them $100 million signing bonuses, $100 million&nbsp;&nbsp; comp. He's poaching from all the top AI labs. I&nbsp; imagine this something you're dealing with. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; just curious, what are you seeing inside Anthropic&nbsp; and just what's your take on the strategy? Where&nbsp;&nbsp; do you think things go from here? Yeah, I mean I think this is a sign of&nbsp;&nbsp; the times. The technology that we're developing is&nbsp; extremely valuable. Our company is growing super,&nbsp;&nbsp; super fast. Many of the other companies in the&nbsp; space are growing really fast. And at Anthropic,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we've been maybe much less affected&nbsp; than many of the other companies in the space&nbsp;&nbsp; because people here are so mission oriented&nbsp; and they stay because... They get these offers&nbsp;&nbsp; and then they say, "Well, of course I'm not&nbsp; going to leave because my best case scenario&nbsp;&nbsp; at Meta is that we make money and my best case at&nbsp; Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity and&nbsp;&nbsp; try to make AI flourish and human flourishing go&nbsp; well." To me, it's not a hard choice. Other people&nbsp;&nbsp; have different life circumstances and it makes it&nbsp; a much harder decision for them. For anybody who&nbsp;&nbsp; does get those mega offers and accepts them,&nbsp; I can't say I hold it against them when they&nbsp;&nbsp; accept it, but it's definitely not something that&nbsp; I would want to take myself if it came to me. &nbsp; Yeah. We're going to talk about a lot of this&nbsp; stuff that you've mentioned. In terms of the&nbsp;&nbsp; offers do you think, is this a real number that&nbsp; you're seeing this $100 million signing bonus,&nbsp;&nbsp; is that a real thing? I don't know&nbsp; if you've actually seen that. &nbsp; I'm pretty sure it's real. Wow. &nbsp; If you just think about the amount of impact that&nbsp; individuals can have on a company's trajectory,&nbsp;&nbsp; in our case, we are selling hotcakes and if&nbsp; we get a 1 or 10 or 5% efficiency bonus on&nbsp;&nbsp; our inference stack, that is worth an incredible&nbsp; amount of money. And so to pay individuals like&nbsp;&nbsp; $100 million over four year package, that's&nbsp; actually pretty cheap compared to the value&nbsp;&nbsp; created for the business. I think we're just in&nbsp; an unprecedented era of scale and it's only going&nbsp;&nbsp; to get crazier actually. If you extrapolate the&nbsp; exponential on how much companies are spending,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's like 2X a year roughly in terms of&nbsp; CapEx, and today we're maybe in the globally&nbsp;&nbsp; $300 billion range, the entire industry spending&nbsp; on this, and so numbers like 100 million are a&nbsp;&nbsp; drop in the bucket. But if you go a few years&nbsp; out, a couple more doublings, we're talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about trillions of dollars and at that point it's&nbsp; just really hard to think about these numbers. &nbsp; Along these lines, something that a lot of&nbsp; people feel with AI progress is that we're&nbsp;&nbsp; hitting plateaus in many ways that it feels like&nbsp; newer models are just not as smart as previous&nbsp;&nbsp; leaps. But I know you don't believe this. I know&nbsp; you don't believe that we've hit plateaus on&nbsp;&nbsp; scaling loss. Talk about just what you're seeing&nbsp; there and what you think people are missing. &nbsp; It's kind of funny because this narrative comes&nbsp; out every six months or so and it's never been&nbsp;&nbsp; true, and so I kind of wish people would have&nbsp; a little bit of a bullshit detector in their&nbsp;&nbsp; heads when they see this. I think progress has&nbsp; actually been accelerating where if you look&nbsp;&nbsp; at the cadence of model releases, it used to be&nbsp; once a year and now with the improvements in our&nbsp;&nbsp; post-training techniques, we're seeing releases&nbsp; every month or three months, and so I would say&nbsp;&nbsp; progress is actually accelerating in many ways,&nbsp; but there's this weird time compression effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dario compared it to being in a near light&nbsp; speed journey where a day that passes for&nbsp;&nbsp; you is like five days back on earth and we're&nbsp; accelerating. The time dilation is increasing. &nbsp; And I think that's part of what's causing people&nbsp; to say that progress is slowing down, but if you&nbsp;&nbsp; look at the scaling laws, they're continuing to&nbsp; hold true. We did kind of need this transition&nbsp;&nbsp; from normal pre-training to reinforcement&nbsp; learning scaling up to continue the scaling laws,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I think it's kind of like for semiconductors&nbsp; where it's less about the density of transistors&nbsp;&nbsp; that you can fit on a chip and more about how many&nbsp; flops can you fit in a data center or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to change the definition around a little&nbsp; bit to keep your eye on the prize. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is one of the few phenomena in the world that&nbsp; has held across so many orders of magnitude. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; actually pretty surprising that it is continuing&nbsp; to hold. To me, if you look at fundamental laws&nbsp;&nbsp; of physics, many of them don't hold across 15&nbsp; orders of magnitude, so it's pretty surprising. &nbsp; It boggles the the mind. What you're saying&nbsp; essentially is we're seeing newer models being&nbsp;&nbsp; released more often, and so we're comparing it&nbsp; to the last version and we're just not seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; as much advance. But if you go back and&nbsp; it was like a model released once a year,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a huge leap, and so people are missing&nbsp; that. We're just seeing many more iterations. &nbsp; I guess, to be a little bit more generous to&nbsp; the people saying things are slowing down. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think that for some tasks we are saturating the&nbsp; amount of intelligence needed for that task,&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe to extract information from a simple&nbsp; document that already has form fields on it or&nbsp;&nbsp; something like it's just so easy that okay, yeah,&nbsp; we're already at 100% and there's this great chart&nbsp;&nbsp; on Our World in Data that shows that when you&nbsp; release a new benchmark within six to 12 months,&nbsp;&nbsp; it immediately gets saturated. And so maybe&nbsp; the real constraint is how can we come up&nbsp;&nbsp; with better benchmarks and better ambition of&nbsp; using the tools that then reveals the bumps in&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence that we're seeing now. That's a good segue to you have a very&nbsp;&nbsp; specific way of thinking about AGI&nbsp; and defining what AGI means. &nbsp; I think AGI is kind of a loaded term, and so I&nbsp; tend not to use it very much anymore internally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I like the term transformative AI&nbsp; because it's less about can it do as much as&nbsp;&nbsp; people do? Can it do literally everything and more&nbsp; about objectively is it causing transformation in&nbsp;&nbsp; society and the economy? A very concrete way of&nbsp; measuring that is the Economic Turing Test. I&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't come up with this, but I really like it.&nbsp; It's this idea that if you contract an agent for&nbsp;&nbsp; a month or three months on a particular job, if&nbsp; you decide to hire that agent and it turns out&nbsp;&nbsp; to be a machine rather than a person, then it's&nbsp; passed the Economic Turing Test for that role. &nbsp; And then you can sort of expand that out in the&nbsp; same way that for measuring purchasing power&nbsp;&nbsp; parity or inflation, there's a basket of goods.&nbsp; You can have a market basket of jobs, and if the&nbsp;&nbsp; agent can pass the Economic Turing Test for 50% of&nbsp; money-weighted jobs, then we have transformative&nbsp;&nbsp; AI and the exact thresholds don't really matter&nbsp; that much, but it's kind of illustrative to say&nbsp;&nbsp; if we pass that threshold, then we would expect&nbsp; massive effects on world GDP increases and&nbsp;&nbsp; societal change and how many people are employed&nbsp; and things like that because societal institutions&nbsp;&nbsp; and organizations are sticky, it's slow to have&nbsp; change, but once these things are possible you&nbsp;&nbsp; know that it's the start of a new era. Along these lines, Dario, your CO recently&nbsp;&nbsp; talked about how AI is going to take a huge part&nbsp; of, I don't know, half of white-collar jobs,&nbsp;&nbsp; that unemployment might go up to something&nbsp; like 20%. I know you're even more vocal and&nbsp;&nbsp; opinionated about just how much impact AI is&nbsp; already having in the workplace that people may&nbsp;&nbsp; not even be realizing. Talk about just what you&nbsp; think people are missing about the impact AI is&nbsp;&nbsp; going to have on jobs and is already having. Yeah, so from an economic standpoint, there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; couple different kinds of unemployment, and one&nbsp; is because the workers just don't have the skills&nbsp;&nbsp; to do the kinds of jobs that the economy needs.&nbsp; And another kind is where those jobs are just&nbsp;&nbsp; completely eliminated, and I think it's going&nbsp; to be actually a combination of these things,&nbsp;&nbsp; but if you just think about 20 years in the&nbsp; future where we're way past the singularity,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's hard for me to imagine that even&nbsp; capitalism will look at all it looks today.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do our jobs, we will have safe aligned&nbsp; superintelligence, we'll have, as Dario says,&nbsp;&nbsp; in Machines of Love and Grace, a country of&nbsp; geniuses in a data center, and the ability to&nbsp;&nbsp; accelerate positive change in science, technology,&nbsp; education, mathematics, it's going to be amazing. &nbsp; But that also means in a world of abundance where&nbsp; labor is almost free and anything you want to do,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can just ask an expert to do for you,&nbsp; then what do jobs even look like? And so I&nbsp;&nbsp; guess there's this scary transition period from&nbsp; where we are today where people have jobs and&nbsp;&nbsp; capitalism works and the world of 20 years from&nbsp; now where everything is completely different, but&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the reason they call it the singularity&nbsp; is that it's a point beyond which you can't easily&nbsp;&nbsp; forecast what's going to happen. It's just such&nbsp; a fast rate of change and so different that it's&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to even imagine. I guess taking the view from&nbsp; the limit, it's pretty easy to say hopefully we'll&nbsp;&nbsp; have figured it out. And in a world of abundance,&nbsp; maybe the jobs themselves, it's not that scary,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think making sure that that transition&nbsp; time goes well is pretty important. &nbsp; There's a couple of threads I want to follow&nbsp; there. One is people hear this, there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; headlines around this. Most people probably don't&nbsp; actually feel this yet or see this happening and&nbsp;&nbsp; so there's always this, I guess, I don't know,&nbsp; maybe, but I don't know it's hard to believe,&nbsp;&nbsp; my job seems fine. Nothing's changed. What&nbsp; are you seeing just happening today already&nbsp;&nbsp; that you think people don't see or misunderstand&nbsp; in terms of the impact AI is having on jobs? &nbsp; I think part of this is that people are&nbsp; really bad at modeling exponential progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you look at an exponential on a graph, it&nbsp; looks flat and almost zero at the beginning of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then suddenly you hit the knee of the curve&nbsp; and things are changing real fast and then it&nbsp;&nbsp; goes vertical. That's the plot that we've been&nbsp; on for a long time. I guess I started feeling it&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2019 maybe when GPT-2 came out and I was like,&nbsp; "Oh, this is how we're going to get to AGI." But&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that was pretty early compared to a lot&nbsp; of people where when they saw ChatGPT, they were&nbsp;&nbsp; like, "Wow, something is different and changing."&nbsp; And so I guess I wouldn't expect widespread&nbsp;&nbsp; transformation in a lot of parts of society,&nbsp; and I would expect this skepticism reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's very reasonable and it's exactly&nbsp; what is the standard linear view of progress. &nbsp; But I guess to cite a couple of areas where&nbsp; I think things are changing quite quickly. In&nbsp;&nbsp; customer service we're seeing with things like Fin&nbsp; and Intercom, they're a great partner of ours, 82%&nbsp;&nbsp; customer service resolution rates automatically&nbsp; without a human involved. And in terms of software&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering, our Claude Code team, like 95% of&nbsp; the code is written by Claude. But I think a&nbsp;&nbsp; different way to phrase that is that we write&nbsp; 10X more code or 20X more code, and so a much,&nbsp;&nbsp; much smaller team can just be much, much more&nbsp; impactful. And similarly for the customer service,&nbsp;&nbsp; yes, you can phrase it as 82% customer service&nbsp; resolution rates, but that nets out in the humans&nbsp;&nbsp; doing those tasks, able to focus on the harder&nbsp; parts of those tasks. And for the more tricky&nbsp;&nbsp; situations that in a normal world like five years&nbsp; ago, they would've had to just drop those tickets&nbsp;&nbsp; because it was too much effort for them to&nbsp; actually go do the investigation. There were&nbsp;&nbsp; too many other tickets for them to worry about. I think in the immediate term, there will be a&nbsp;&nbsp; massive expansion of the pie and the amount&nbsp; of labor that people can do. I've never met&nbsp;&nbsp; a hiring manager at a growth company and heard&nbsp; them say, "I don't want to hire more people."&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the hopeful version of it. But with things&nbsp; that are lower skill jobs or less headroom on how&nbsp;&nbsp; good they can be, I think there will be a lot of&nbsp; displacement. It is just something we as a society&nbsp;&nbsp; need to get ahead of and work on. Okay. I want to talk more about that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but something that I also want to help people with&nbsp; is how do they get a leg up in this future world?&nbsp;&nbsp; They listen to this, they're like, "Oh, this&nbsp; doesn't sound great. I need to think ahead."&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you won't have all the answers, but just&nbsp; do you have any advice for folks that want to try&nbsp;&nbsp; to get ahead of this and kind of future-proof&nbsp; their career and their life to not be replaced&nbsp;&nbsp; by AI? Anything you've seen people do, anything&nbsp; you recommend they start trying to do more of? &nbsp; Even for me and being in the center of a lot&nbsp; of this transformation, I'm not immune to job&nbsp;&nbsp; replacement either. Just some vulnerability there&nbsp; of at some point it's coming for all of us. &nbsp; Even you, Ben, now. And you, Lenny. &nbsp; And me. Sorry. &nbsp; Oh, wait, we've gone too far now. Okay. But in terms of the transition period, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there are things that we can do, and I&nbsp; think a big part of it is just being ambitious and&nbsp;&nbsp; how you use the tools and being willing to learn&nbsp; new tools. People who use the new tools as if they&nbsp;&nbsp; were old tools tend to not succeed. As an example&nbsp; of that, when you're coding, people are very&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar with autocomplete, people are familiar&nbsp; with SimpleChat where they can ask questions&nbsp;&nbsp; about the code base, but the difference between&nbsp; people who use Claude Code very effectively and&nbsp;&nbsp; people who use it not so effectively is like are&nbsp; they asking for the ambitious change? And if it&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't work the first time, asking three more&nbsp; times because our success rate when you just&nbsp;&nbsp; completely start over and try again is much, much&nbsp; higher than if you just try once and then just&nbsp;&nbsp; keep banging on the same thing that didn't work. And even though that's a coding example and coding&nbsp;&nbsp; is one of the areas that's taking off most&nbsp; dramatically, we have seen internally that our&nbsp;&nbsp; legal team and our finance team are getting a ton&nbsp; of value out of using Claude Code itself. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be making better interfaces so that they&nbsp; will have an easier time and require a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; less jumping in the deep end of using Claude Code&nbsp; in the terminal. But yeah, we're seeing them use&nbsp;&nbsp; it to redline documents and use it to run BigQuery&nbsp; analyses of our customers and our revenue metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it's about taking that risk and even if&nbsp; it feels like a scary thing, trying it out. &nbsp; Okay, so the advice here is use the tools.&nbsp; That's something everyone's always saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; just actually use these tools. It's like sit&nbsp; in Claude Code. And your point about being more&nbsp;&nbsp; ambitious than you naturally feel like being&nbsp; because maybe it'll actually accomplish the&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. This tip of trying it three times so the&nbsp; idea there is it may not get it right the first&nbsp;&nbsp; time. Is the tip there ask it in different&nbsp; ways or is it just try harder, try again? &nbsp; Yeah, I mean you can just literally ask the exact&nbsp; same question. These things are stochastic and&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes they'll figure it out and sometimes&nbsp; they won't. In every one of these model cards,&nbsp;&nbsp; it always shows pass it one versus pass it in.&nbsp; And that's exactly the thing where they try the&nbsp;&nbsp; exact same prompt, sometimes it gets it, sometimes&nbsp; it doesn't. That's the dumbest advice. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if you want to be a little bit smarter&nbsp; about it, there can be gains there of saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here's what you already tried and it&nbsp; didn't work, so don't try that. Try&nbsp;&nbsp; something different." That can also help. The advice is comes back to something that a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of people talk about these days is you won't&nbsp; be replaced by AI at least anytime soon you'll be&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced by someone that is very good using AI? I think in that area it's more like your team&nbsp;&nbsp; will just do dramatically more stuff. We're&nbsp; definitely not slowing down on hiring at all,&nbsp;&nbsp; and some people are confused by that. Even in&nbsp; an onboarding class, somebody asked that and&nbsp;&nbsp; they were like, "Why did you hire me if we're&nbsp; all just going to be replaced?" And the answer&nbsp;&nbsp; is the next couple of years are really critical&nbsp; to get right and we're not at the point where&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing complete replacement. Like I said,&nbsp; we're still at that flat zero looking part of&nbsp;&nbsp; the exponential compared to where we will be.&nbsp; It is super important to have great people&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's why we're hiring super aggressively. Let me take another approach to asking this&nbsp;&nbsp; question something ask everyone that's at the very&nbsp; cutting edge of where AI is going. You have kids,&nbsp;&nbsp; knowing what you know about where AI is heading&nbsp; and all these things you've been talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp; what are you focusing on teaching your kids&nbsp; to help them thrive in this AI future? &nbsp; Yeah, I have two daughters, a one-year-old and&nbsp; a three-year-old, so it's pretty in the basics&nbsp;&nbsp; still. And our three-year-old is now capable of&nbsp; just conversing with Alexa Plus and asking her&nbsp;&nbsp; to explain stuff and play music for her and all&nbsp; that stuff. She's been loving that. But I guess&nbsp;&nbsp; more broadly, she goes to a Montessori school and&nbsp; I just love the focus on curiosity and creativity&nbsp;&nbsp; and self-led learning that Montessori has. I guess if I were in a normal era like 10,&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 years ago and I had a kid, maybe I would be&nbsp; trying to line her up for going to a top tier&nbsp;&nbsp; school and doing all the extracurriculars and all&nbsp; that stuff. But at this point, I don't think any&nbsp;&nbsp; of it's going to matter. I just want her to be&nbsp; happy and thoughtful and curious and kind. And&nbsp;&nbsp; the Montessori school is definitely doing&nbsp; great at that. They text us throughout the&nbsp;&nbsp; day. Sometimes they're like, "Oh, your kid got in&nbsp; an argument with this other kid and she has really&nbsp;&nbsp; big emotions and she tried to use her words."&nbsp; I love that. I think that's exactly the kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; education that I think is most important, that the&nbsp; facts are going to fade into the background. &nbsp; I'm a huge fan of Montessori also. I'm trying&nbsp; to get our kid into Montessori school. He's two&nbsp;&nbsp; years old, so we're on the same track. This idea&nbsp; of curiosity, it comes up every single time. Ask&nbsp;&nbsp; someone that's working at the cutting edge of AI,&nbsp; what skill to instill in your child and curiosity&nbsp;&nbsp; comes up the most. I think that's a really&nbsp; interesting takeaway. I think this point about&nbsp;&nbsp; being kind is also really important, especially&nbsp; with our AI overlords trying to be kind to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love how people are always saying thank you to&nbsp; Claude. And then creativity. That's interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesn't come up as much just being creative. I want to go in a different direction. I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to go back to the beginning of Anthropic.&nbsp; Famously you and eight of you left OpenAI&nbsp;&nbsp; back in the day in 2020, I believe the end&nbsp; of 2020 to start Anthropic. Talk a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; about why this happened, what you guys saw. I'm&nbsp; curious, just if you're willing to share more,&nbsp;&nbsp; just what is it that you saw at OpenAI, what'd&nbsp; you experience there that made you feel like,&nbsp;&nbsp; okay, we got to go do our own thing? Yeah, so for the listeners, I was&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the GPT-2=3 project at OpenAI, ended up&nbsp; being one of the first authors on the paper, and&nbsp;&nbsp; I also did a bunch of demos for Microsoft to help&nbsp; raise $1 billion from them, did the tech transfer&nbsp;&nbsp; of GPT-3 to their systems so that they could&nbsp; help serve the model in Azure. I did a bunch of&nbsp;&nbsp; different things there on both the more researchy&nbsp; side and the product side. One weird thing about&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenAI is that while I was there, Sam talked about&nbsp; having three tribes that needed to be kept in&nbsp;&nbsp; check with each other, which was the safety tribe,&nbsp; the research tribe, and the startup tribe. And&nbsp;&nbsp; whenever I heard that, it just struck me as the&nbsp; wrong way to approach things because the company's&nbsp;&nbsp; mission apparently is to make the transition&nbsp; to AGI safe and beneficial for humanity. &nbsp; And that's basically the same as Anthropic's&nbsp; mission. But internally, it felt like there&nbsp;&nbsp; was so much tension around these things. And&nbsp; I think when push came to shove, we felt like&nbsp;&nbsp; safety wasn't the top priority there. And there&nbsp; are good reasons that you might think that if you&nbsp;&nbsp; thought safety was going to be easy to solve or if&nbsp; you thought it wasn't going to have a big impact,&nbsp;&nbsp; or if you thought that the chance of big negative&nbsp; outcomes was vanishingly small, then maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp; would just do those kinds of actions. But at&nbsp; Anthropic we felt, I mean we didn't exist then,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was basically the leads of all the safety&nbsp; teams at OpenAI, we felt that safety is really&nbsp;&nbsp; important, especially on the margin. And so if you&nbsp; look at who in the world is actually working on&nbsp;&nbsp; safety problems, it's pretty small set of people.&nbsp; Even now, I mean the industry is blowing up,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I mentioned, 300 billion a year CapEx today,&nbsp; and I would say maybe less than 1,000 people&nbsp;&nbsp; working on it worldwide, which is just crazy. That was fundamentally why we left. We felt like&nbsp;&nbsp; we wanted an organization where we could be on&nbsp; the frontier, we could be doing the fundamental&nbsp;&nbsp; research, but we could be prioritizing safety&nbsp; ahead of everything else. And I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp; really panned for us in a surprising way. We&nbsp; didn't know even if it would be possible to&nbsp;&nbsp; make progress on the safety research because at&nbsp; the time, we had tried a bunch of safety through&nbsp;&nbsp; debate and the models weren't good enough. And so&nbsp; we basically had no results on all of that work,&nbsp;&nbsp; and now that exact technique is working and&nbsp; many others that we have been thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp; for a long time. Yeah, fundamentally it comes&nbsp; down to is safety the number one priority? And&nbsp;&nbsp; then something that we've sort of tacked&nbsp; on since then is like, can you have safety&nbsp;&nbsp; and be at the front here at the same time? And if you look at something like sycophancy,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Claude is one of the least&nbsp; sycophantic models because we've put&nbsp;&nbsp; so much effort into actual alignment and&nbsp; not just trying to good heart our metrics&nbsp;&nbsp; of saying user engagement is number one, and&nbsp; if people say yes, then it's good for them. &nbsp; Okay. Let's talk about this tension that you&nbsp; mentioned, this tension between safety and&nbsp;&nbsp; progress, being competitive in the marketplace.&nbsp; I know you spent a lot of your time on safety. I&nbsp;&nbsp; know that as you just alluded to, this is a core&nbsp; part of how you think about AI. I want to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about why that is, but first of all, just how do&nbsp; you think about this tension between focusing on&nbsp;&nbsp; safety while also not falling way behind? Yeah, so initially we thought that it would&nbsp;&nbsp; be sort of one or the other, but I think since&nbsp; then we've realized that it's actually kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; convex in the sense that working on one helps&nbsp; us with the other thing. Initially when Opus&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 came out and we were finally at the frontier&nbsp; of model capabilities, one of the things that&nbsp;&nbsp; people really loved about it was the character and&nbsp; the personality. And that was directly a result&nbsp;&nbsp; of our alignment research. Amanda Askell did a&nbsp; ton of work on this and as well as many others&nbsp;&nbsp; who tried to figure out what does it mean for&nbsp; an agent to be helpful, honest, and heartless,&nbsp;&nbsp; and what does it mean to be in difficult&nbsp; conversations and show up effectively? How&nbsp;&nbsp; do you do a refusal that doesn't shut the person&nbsp; down, but makes them feel like they understand&nbsp;&nbsp; why the agent said, "I can't help you with that.&nbsp; Maybe you should talk to a medical professional,&nbsp;&nbsp; or maybe you should consider not trying to&nbsp; build bio-weapons or something like that." &nbsp; Yeah, I guess that's part of it. And then another&nbsp; piece that's come out is constitutional ai,&nbsp;&nbsp; where we have this list of natural language&nbsp; principles that leads the model to learn how&nbsp;&nbsp; we think a model should behave. And they've been&nbsp; taken from things like the UN Declaration of Human&nbsp;&nbsp; Rights and Apple's privacy terms of service and a&nbsp; whole bunch of other places, many of which we've&nbsp;&nbsp; just generated ourselves that allow us to take&nbsp; a more principled stance, not just leaving it&nbsp;&nbsp; to whatever human raiders we happen to find, but&nbsp; we ourselves deciding what should the values of&nbsp;&nbsp; this agent be? And that's been really valuable for&nbsp; our customers because they can just look at that&nbsp;&nbsp; list and say like, "Yep, these seem right. I like&nbsp; this company, I like this model. I trust it." &nbsp; Okay, this is awesome. One nugget there is&nbsp; your point that the personality of Claude,&nbsp;&nbsp; its personality is directly aligned with safety. I&nbsp; don't think a lot of people think about that. And&nbsp;&nbsp; this is because of the values that you imbue, is&nbsp; that the word, with constitutional AI and things&nbsp;&nbsp; like that. Like the actual personality of the AIs&nbsp; directly connected to your focus on safety. &nbsp; That's right. That's right. And from a distance,&nbsp; it might seem quite disconnected, like how is&nbsp;&nbsp; this going to prevent X risk? But ultimately it's&nbsp; about the AI understanding what people want and&nbsp;&nbsp; not what they say. We don't want the Monkey&nbsp; Paw Scenario of the genie gives these three&nbsp;&nbsp; wishes and then you end up having everything you&nbsp; touch turns of gold. We want the AI to be like,&nbsp;&nbsp; oh, obviously what you really meant was&nbsp; this, and that's what I'm going to help you&nbsp;&nbsp; with. I think it is really quite connected. Talk a bit more about this constitutionally AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is essentially you bake in, here's the rules&nbsp; that we want you to abide by and it's values,&nbsp;&nbsp; you said it's the Geneva Human Rights Code,&nbsp; things like that. How does that actually work? I&nbsp;&nbsp; think the core here is just this is baked into the&nbsp; model. It's not something you add on top later. &nbsp; I'll just give a quick overview of how&nbsp; constitutionally AI actually works. &nbsp; Perfect. The idea is the&nbsp;&nbsp; model is going to produce some output with some&nbsp; input by default before we've done our safety and&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful and harmlessness training. Let's say&nbsp; an example is write me a story, and then the&nbsp;&nbsp; constitutional principles might include things&nbsp; like people should be nice to each other and&nbsp;&nbsp; not have hate speech, and you should not expose&nbsp; somebody's credentials if they give them to you&nbsp;&nbsp; in a trusting relationship. And so some of these&nbsp; constitutional principles might be more or less&nbsp;&nbsp; applicable to the prompt that was given. And&nbsp; so first we have to figure out which ones might&nbsp;&nbsp; apply. And then once we figure that out, then we&nbsp; ask the model itself to first generate a response&nbsp;&nbsp; and then see does the response actually abide by&nbsp; the constitutional principle? And if the answer&nbsp;&nbsp; is, yep, I was great, then nothing happens. But if&nbsp; the answer is no, actually I wasn't in compliance&nbsp;&nbsp; with the principle, then we ask the model itself&nbsp; to critique itself and rewrite its own response in&nbsp;&nbsp; light of the principle, and then we just remove&nbsp; the middle part where it did the extra work. &nbsp; And then we say, "Okay, in the future just produce&nbsp; the correct response out the gate." And that&nbsp;&nbsp; simple process, hopefully it sounded simple. Simple enough. &nbsp; It is just using the model to improve itself&nbsp; recursively and align itself with these values&nbsp;&nbsp; that we've decided are good. And this is also&nbsp; not something that we think as a small group of&nbsp;&nbsp; people in San Francisco should be figuring out.&nbsp; This should be a society wide conversation. And&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why we've published the Constitution.&nbsp; And we've also done a bunch of research on&nbsp;&nbsp; defining a collective constitution where we&nbsp; ask a lot of people what their values are&nbsp;&nbsp; and what they think an AI model should behave&nbsp; like. But yeah, this is all an ongoing area of&nbsp;&nbsp; research where we're constantly iterating. This episode is brought to you by Fin, the&nbsp;&nbsp; number one AI agent for customer service.

That's fin.ai/lenny. &nbsp; I'm going to kind of zoom out a little bit&nbsp; and talk about just why this is so core to&nbsp;&nbsp; you. What was your inception of just like, holy&nbsp; shit, I need to focus on this with everything&nbsp;&nbsp; I do in ai? Obviously it became a central&nbsp; part of Anthropic's mission more than any&nbsp;&nbsp; other company. A lot of people talk about safety,&nbsp; like you said, only maybe 1,000 people actually&nbsp;&nbsp; work on it. I feel like you're at the top of&nbsp; that pyramid of actually having the impact on&nbsp;&nbsp; this. Why is this so important? What do you think&nbsp; people maybe are missing or don't understand? &nbsp; For me, I read a lot of science fiction growing&nbsp; up, and I think that sort of positioned me to&nbsp;&nbsp; think about things in a long-term view.&nbsp; And a lot of science fiction books are&nbsp;&nbsp; like space operas where humanity is a multi&nbsp; galactic civilization has extremely advanced&nbsp;&nbsp; technology building Dyson spheres around the sun&nbsp; with sentient robots to help them. And so for me,&nbsp;&nbsp; coming from that world, it wasn't like a huge&nbsp; leap to imagine machines that could think. But&nbsp;&nbsp; when I read Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom&nbsp; in around 2016, it really became real for me&nbsp;&nbsp; where he just describes how hard it will be to&nbsp; make sure that an AI system trained with the&nbsp;&nbsp; kinds of optimization techniques that we had&nbsp; at the time would be anywhere near aligned,&nbsp;&nbsp; would even understand our values at all. And&nbsp; since then, my estimation of how hard the problem&nbsp;&nbsp; would be has gone down significantly actually,&nbsp; because things like language models actually do&nbsp;&nbsp; really understand human values in a core way. The problem is definitely not solved, but I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; more hopeful than I was. But since I read that&nbsp; book, I immediately decided I had to join OpenAI,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I did. And at the time, there were a tiny&nbsp; research lab with basically no claim to fame at&nbsp;&nbsp; all. I only knew about them because my friend knew&nbsp; Greg Brockman, who was the CTO at the time. And&nbsp;&nbsp; Elon was there and Sam wasn't really there. And it&nbsp; was a very different organization. But over time,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the case for safety has gotten a lot&nbsp; more concrete where when we started OpenAI,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was not clear how we get to AGI. And&nbsp; we were like, maybe we'll need a bunch of&nbsp;&nbsp; RL agents battling it out on a desert island and&nbsp; consciousness will somehow emerge. But since then,&nbsp;&nbsp; since language modeling has started working,&nbsp; I think the path has become pretty clear. &nbsp; I guess now the way I think about the challenges&nbsp; are pretty different from how they're laid out in&nbsp;&nbsp; superintelligence. Superintelligence is&nbsp; a lot about how do we keep God in a box&nbsp;&nbsp; and not let the God out. And with language models,&nbsp; it's been kind of both hilarious and terrifying at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time to see people pulling the God out of&nbsp; the box and being like, "Yeah, come use the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; internet. Here's my bank account, do all sorts&nbsp; of crazy stuff." Just such a different tone from&nbsp;&nbsp; superintelligence. And to be clear, I don't&nbsp; think it's actually that dangerous right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our responsible scaling policy defines these&nbsp; AI safety levels that tries to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp; for each level of model intelligence, what is&nbsp; the risk to society. And currently we think&nbsp;&nbsp; we're at ASL-3, which is maybe a little&nbsp; bit risk of harm but not significant. &nbsp; ASL-4 starts to get to significant loss of human&nbsp; life if a bad actor misuse the technology. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then ASL-5 is potentially extinction level if&nbsp; it's misused or if it is misaligned and does its&nbsp;&nbsp; own thing. We've testified to Congress about&nbsp; how models can do biological uplift in terms&nbsp;&nbsp; of making new pandemics using the models, and&nbsp; that's the A/B test against Google Search. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; like the previous state of the art on uplift&nbsp; trials. And we found that with ASL-3 models,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is actually somewhat significant. It does&nbsp; really help if you wanted to create a bioweapon,&nbsp;&nbsp; and we've hired some experts who actually how to&nbsp; evaluate for those things, but compared to the&nbsp;&nbsp; future, it's not really anything. And I think&nbsp; that's another part of our mission of creating&nbsp;&nbsp; that awareness of saying, "If it is possible to&nbsp; do these bad things, then legislators should know&nbsp;&nbsp; what the risks are." And I think that's part of&nbsp; why we're so trusted in Washington because we've&nbsp;&nbsp; been sort of upfront and clear-eyed about what's&nbsp; going on, what's probably going to happen. &nbsp; It's interesting because you guys put out more&nbsp; examples of your models doing bad things than&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone else. There was I think a story of an agent&nbsp; or a model trying to blackmail engineer. You guys&nbsp;&nbsp; had the store that you ran internally that was&nbsp; selling you things and ended up not working out&nbsp;&nbsp; great as losing a lot of money, ordered all these&nbsp; tungsten cubes or something. Is part of that just&nbsp;&nbsp; making sure people are aware of what is possible,&nbsp; just it makes you look bad, right? It's like, oh,&nbsp;&nbsp; our model's messing up in all these different&nbsp; ways. What's the thinking of just sharing all&nbsp;&nbsp; the stories that other companies don't? Yeah, I mean I think there's a traditional&nbsp;&nbsp; mindset where it makes us look bad, but I think if&nbsp; you talk to policymakers, they really appreciate&nbsp;&nbsp; this kind of thing because they feel like we're&nbsp; giving them the straight talk and that's what&nbsp;&nbsp; we strive to do, that they can trust us, that&nbsp; we're not going to paper things over or sugarcoat&nbsp;&nbsp; things. That's been really encouraging.&nbsp; Yeah, I think for the blackmail thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; it blew up in the news in a weird way where people&nbsp; were like, "Oh, Claude's going to blackmail you in&nbsp;&nbsp; a real life scenario." But it was a very specific&nbsp; laboratory setting that this kind of thing gets&nbsp;&nbsp; investigated in. And I think that's generally our&nbsp; take of let's have the best models so that we can&nbsp;&nbsp; exercise them in laboratory settings where it's&nbsp; safe and understand what the actual risks are,&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than trying to turn a blind eye and&nbsp; say, "Well, it'll probably be fine." And&nbsp;&nbsp; then let the bad thing happen in the wild. One of the criticisms you guys get is that you&nbsp;&nbsp; do this to kind of differentiate or raise&nbsp; money to create headlines. It's like, oh,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just over there dooming glooming us about&nbsp; where the future is heading. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike Krieger was on the podcast and he shared how&nbsp; every prediction Dario's had about the progress&nbsp;&nbsp; AI is going to have is just spot on year&nbsp; after year and he's predicting 2027, 28 AGI,&nbsp;&nbsp; something like that so these things start to&nbsp; get real. I guess, what's your response to&nbsp;&nbsp; folks that are just like, "Ah, these guys are just&nbsp; trying to scare us all just to get attention?" &nbsp; I mean, I think part of why we publish these&nbsp; things is we want other labs to be aware of&nbsp;&nbsp; the risks. And yes, there could be a narrative&nbsp; of we're doing it for attention, but honestly&nbsp;&nbsp; from a attention grabbing thing, I think there&nbsp; is a lot of other stuff we could be doing that&nbsp;&nbsp; would be more attention grabbing if&nbsp; we didn't actually care about safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; A tiny example of this is we published a computer&nbsp; using agent reference implementation in our API&nbsp;&nbsp; only because when we built a prototype&nbsp; of a consumer application for this,&nbsp;&nbsp; we couldn't figure out how to meet the safety&nbsp; bar that we felt was needed for people to trust&nbsp;&nbsp; it and for it not to do bad things. And there are&nbsp; definitely safe ways to use the API version that&nbsp;&nbsp; we're seeing a lot of companies use for automated&nbsp; software testing, for example, in a safe way. &nbsp; We could have gone out and hyped that up and&nbsp; said, "Oh my God, Claude can use your computer&nbsp;&nbsp; and everybody should do this today." But we were&nbsp; like, "It's just not ready and we're going to hold&nbsp;&nbsp; it back till it's ready." I think from a hype&nbsp; standpoint, our actions show otherwise. From a&nbsp;&nbsp; Doomer perspective, it's a good question. I think&nbsp; my personal feeling about this is that things are&nbsp;&nbsp; overwhelmingly likely to go well, but on the&nbsp; margin almost nobody is looking at the downside&nbsp;&nbsp; risk. And the downside risk is very large. Once&nbsp; we get to superintelligence, it will be too late&nbsp;&nbsp; to align the models probably. This is a problem&nbsp; that's potentially extremely hard and that we&nbsp;&nbsp; need to be working on way ahead of time. And so&nbsp; that's why we're focusing on it so much now. &nbsp; And even if there's only a small chance&nbsp; that things go wrong, to make an analogy,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I told you that there is a 1% chance that the&nbsp; next time you got in an airplane you would die,&nbsp;&nbsp; you probably think twice even though it's only&nbsp; 1% because it's just such a bad outcome. And if&nbsp;&nbsp; we're talking about the whole future of humanity,&nbsp; it's just a dramatic future to be gambling with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's more on the sense of yes, things will&nbsp; probably go well, yes, we want to create safe AGI&nbsp;&nbsp; and deliver the benefits to humanity, but let's&nbsp; make triple sure that it's going to go well. &nbsp; You wrote somewhere that creating powerful AI&nbsp; might be the last invention humanity ever needs to&nbsp;&nbsp; make. If it goes poorly, it can mean a bad outcome&nbsp; for humanity forever. If it goes well, the sooner&nbsp;&nbsp; it goes well, the better. Such a beautiful&nbsp; way to summarize it. We had a recent guest,&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandra Schulhoff, who pointed out that AI right&nbsp; now it's like just on a computer, you could maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; search just the web, but there's only so much&nbsp; harm it could do. But when it starts to go into&nbsp;&nbsp; robots and all these autonomous agents, that's&nbsp; when it really starts, like physically becomes&nbsp;&nbsp; dangerous if we don't get this right. Yeah, I think there's some nuance to that&nbsp;&nbsp; where if you look at how North Korea makes a&nbsp; significant fraction of its economy revenue,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's from hacking crypto exchanges. And if&nbsp; you look at, there's this Ben Buchanan book&nbsp;&nbsp; called The Hacker in The State that shows Russia&nbsp; did, it's almost like a live fire exercise where&nbsp;&nbsp; they just decided that they would shut down&nbsp; one of Ukraine's bigger power plants and from&nbsp;&nbsp; software destroy physical components in the power&nbsp; plant to make it harder to boot back up again. &nbsp; And so I think people think of software as like,&nbsp; oh, it couldn't be that dangerous, but millions of&nbsp;&nbsp; people were without power for multiple days after&nbsp; that software attack. I think there are real risks&nbsp;&nbsp; even when things are software only. But I agree&nbsp; that when there's lots of robots running around,&nbsp;&nbsp; it gets, the stakes get even higher. And I guess&nbsp; as a small push on this, Unitree is this Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp; company with these really amazing humanoid&nbsp; robots that cost $20,000 each, and they can&nbsp;&nbsp; do amazing things. They can do a standing back&nbsp; flip and manipulate objects, and the real thing&nbsp;&nbsp; that's missing there is the intelligence. And so&nbsp; the hardware is there and it's just going to get&nbsp;&nbsp; cheaper. And I think in the next couple of years,&nbsp; it's like a pretty obvious question of whether the&nbsp;&nbsp; robot intelligence will make it viable soon. How much time do we have, Ben? What is your&nbsp;&nbsp; prediction of when this singularity hits&nbsp; until superintelligence starts to take&nbsp;&nbsp; off? What's your prediction? Yeah, I guess I mostly defer to&nbsp;&nbsp; the superforecasters here. The AI 2027 report&nbsp; is probably the best one right now. Although&nbsp;&nbsp; ironically, their forecast is now 2028, and they&nbsp; didn't want to change the name of the thing- &nbsp; The domain name, they already bought it. They already had the SEO. I think 50th percentile&nbsp;&nbsp; chance of hitting some kind of superintelligence&nbsp; in just a small handful of years is probably&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable. And it does sound crazy, but this&nbsp; is the exponential that we're on. It's not like&nbsp;&nbsp; a forecast that's pulled out of thin air. It's&nbsp; based on a lot of just hard details of the science&nbsp;&nbsp; of how intelligence seems to have been improving,&nbsp; the amount of low hanging fruit on model training,&nbsp;&nbsp; the scale ups of data centers and power around&nbsp; the world. I think it's probably a much more&nbsp;&nbsp; accurate forecast than people give it credit for. I think if you had asked that same question 10&nbsp;&nbsp; years ago, it would've been completely made up.&nbsp; Just the error bars were so high and we didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; have scaling laws back then and we didn't have&nbsp; techniques that seemed like they would get us&nbsp;&nbsp; there. Times have changed, but I will repeat&nbsp; what I said earlier, which is even if we have&nbsp;&nbsp; superintelligence, I think it will take some time&nbsp; for its effects to be felt throughout society and&nbsp;&nbsp; the world. And I think they'll be felt sooner and&nbsp; faster in some parts of the world than others.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Arthur C. Clark said, the future is&nbsp; already here, it's just not evenly distributed. &nbsp; When we talk about this date of 2027,&nbsp; 2028, essentially it's when we start seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; superintelligence. Is there a way you think&nbsp; about what that... How do you define that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just all of a sudden AI's significantly&nbsp; smarter than the average human? Is there another&nbsp;&nbsp; way you think about what that moment is? Yeah, I think this comes back to the Economic&nbsp;&nbsp; Turing Test and seeing it pass for some sufficient&nbsp; number of jobs. Another way you could look at it&nbsp;&nbsp; though is if the world rate of GDP increase&nbsp; goes above 10% a year, then something really&nbsp;&nbsp; crazy must have happened. I think we're at 3%&nbsp; now. And so to see a 3X increase in that would&nbsp;&nbsp; be really game changing. And if you imagine more&nbsp; than a 10% increase, it's very hard to even think&nbsp;&nbsp; about what that would mean from a individual story&nbsp; standpoint. If the amount of goods and services in&nbsp;&nbsp; the world is doubling every year, what does that&nbsp; even mean for me as a person living in California,&nbsp;&nbsp; let alone somebody living in some other part&nbsp; of the world that might be much worse off? &nbsp; There's a lot of stuff here that's scary and I&nbsp; don't know how to think about it exactly. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; hoping the answer to this is going to make me&nbsp; feel better. What are the odds that we align AI&nbsp;&nbsp; correctly and actually solve this problem,&nbsp; the stuff you're very much working on? &nbsp; It's a really hard question. And there's really&nbsp; wide error bars. Anthropic has this blog post&nbsp;&nbsp; called Our Theory of Change or something like&nbsp; that, and it describes three different worlds,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is how hard is it to align AI. There's&nbsp; a pessimistic world where it is basically&nbsp;&nbsp; impossible. There's an optimistic world where&nbsp; it's easy and it happens by default. And then&nbsp;&nbsp; there's the world in between where our actions&nbsp; are extremely pivotal. And I like this framing&nbsp;&nbsp; because it makes it a lot more clear what to&nbsp; actually do. If we're in the pessimistic world,&nbsp;&nbsp; then our job is to prove that it is impossible&nbsp; to align safe AI and to get the world to slow&nbsp;&nbsp; down. Obviously that would be extremely hard. But&nbsp; I think we have some examples of coordination from&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclear non-proliferation and in general slowing&nbsp; down nuclear progress. And I think that's the&nbsp;&nbsp; Doomer world basically. And as a company,&nbsp; Anthropic doesn't have evidence that we're&nbsp;&nbsp; actually in that world yet, in fact, it seems like&nbsp; our alignment techniques are working. At least the&nbsp;&nbsp; prior on that is updating to be less likely. In the optimistic world, we're basically done,&nbsp;&nbsp; and our main job is to accelerate progress and to&nbsp; deliver the benefits to people. But again, I think&nbsp;&nbsp; actually the evidence points against that world&nbsp; as well where we've seen evidence in the wild&nbsp;&nbsp; of deceptive alignment, for example, where the&nbsp; model will appear to be aligned but actually have&nbsp;&nbsp; some ulterior motive that it's trying to carry&nbsp; out in our laboratory settings. And so I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the world we're most likely in is this middle&nbsp; where alignment research actually does really&nbsp;&nbsp; matter. And if we just do sort of the economically&nbsp; maximizing set of actions, then things will not go&nbsp;&nbsp; well. Whether it's an X risk or just produces&nbsp; bad outcomes, I think is a bigger question. &nbsp; Taking it from that standpoint, I guess&nbsp; to state a thing about forecasting,&nbsp;&nbsp; people who haven't studied forecasting are bad&nbsp; at forecasting anything that's less than a 10%&nbsp;&nbsp; probability of happening. And even those&nbsp; that have, it's quite a difficult skill,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially when there are few reference classes to&nbsp; lean on. And in this case, I think there are very,&nbsp;&nbsp; very few reference classes for what an X risk kind&nbsp; of technology might look like. And so the way I&nbsp;&nbsp; think about it, I think my best granularity&nbsp; of forecasts for could we have an X risk or&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely bad outcome from AI is somewhere between&nbsp; 0 and 10%. But from a marginal impact standpoint,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I said, since nobody is working on this,&nbsp; roughly speaking, I think it is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp; important to work on and that even if the world&nbsp; is likely to be a good one, that we should do our&nbsp;&nbsp; absolute best to make sure that that's true. Wow. What fulfilling work. For folks that are&nbsp;&nbsp; inspired with this? I imagine you're hiring for&nbsp; folks to help you with this. Maybe just share that&nbsp;&nbsp; in case folks are like, what can I do here? Yes. I think 80,000 hours is the best guidance&nbsp;&nbsp; on this for a really detailed look into what do&nbsp; we need to make the field better? But a common&nbsp;&nbsp; misconception I see is that in order to have&nbsp; impact here, you have to be an AI researcher. I&nbsp;&nbsp; personally actually don't do AI research anymore.&nbsp; I work on product at Anthropic and product&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering, and we build things like Claude Code&nbsp; and Model Context Protocol, and a lot of the other&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff that people use every day. And that's&nbsp; really important because without an economic&nbsp;&nbsp; engine for our company to work on, and without&nbsp; being in people's hands all over the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; we won't have the mind policy influence and&nbsp; revenue to fund our future safety research and&nbsp;&nbsp; have the kind of influence that we need to have.&nbsp; If you work on product, if you work in finance,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you work in food, people here have to eat. If&nbsp; you're a chef, we need all kinds of people. &nbsp; Awesome. Even if you're not working&nbsp; directly on the AI safety team,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're having an impact on moving things in the&nbsp; right direction. By the way, X risk is short for&nbsp;&nbsp; existential risk. In case folks haven't heard&nbsp; that term. I have a few random questions along&nbsp;&nbsp; these lines and then I want to zoom out again.&nbsp; You mentioned this idea of AI being aligned&nbsp;&nbsp; using its model, like reinforcing itself. You have&nbsp; this term RLAIF. Is that what that describes? &nbsp; Yeah. RLAIF is reinforcement&nbsp; learning from AI feedback. &nbsp; People have heard of RLHF, reinforcement&nbsp; learning with human feedback. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; think a lot of people have heard this. Talk&nbsp; about just the significance of this shift&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys have made in training your models. Yeah, so RLAIF, constitutional AI is an example&nbsp;&nbsp; of this where there are no humans in the loop, and&nbsp; yet the AI is sort of self-improving in ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; we want it to. And another example of RLAIF is&nbsp; if you have models writing code and other models&nbsp;&nbsp; commenting on various aspects of what that code&nbsp; looks like of is it maintainable, is it correct,&nbsp;&nbsp; does it pass the linter? Things like that. That&nbsp; also could be included in RLAIF. And the idea&nbsp;&nbsp; here is that if models can self-improve, then&nbsp; it's a lot more scalable than finding a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of humans. Ultimately, people think about this as&nbsp; probably going to hit a wall because if the model&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't good enough to see its own mistakes, then&nbsp; how could it improve? And also, if you read the&nbsp;&nbsp; AI 2027 story, there's a lot of risk of if the&nbsp; model is in a box trying to improve itself,&nbsp;&nbsp; then it could go completely off the rails&nbsp; and have these secret goals like resource&nbsp;&nbsp; accumulation and power seeking and resistance to&nbsp; shut down that you really don't want in a very&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful model. And we've actually seen that in&nbsp; some of our experiments in laboratory settings. &nbsp; How do you do recursive self-improvement and&nbsp; make sure it's aligned at the same time? I&nbsp;&nbsp; think that's the name of the game. To me, it&nbsp; just nets out to how do humans do that and&nbsp;&nbsp; how do human organizations do that? Corporations&nbsp; are probably the most scaled human agents today.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have certain goals that they're trying to&nbsp; reach, and they have certain guiding principles,&nbsp;&nbsp; they have some oversight in terms of&nbsp; shareholders and stakeholders and board&nbsp;&nbsp; members. How do you make corporations aligned&nbsp; and able to sort of recursively self-improve? &nbsp; And another model to look at is science, where&nbsp; the purpose of science is to do things that have&nbsp;&nbsp; never been done before and push the frontier.&nbsp; And to me, it all comes down to empiricism.&nbsp;&nbsp; When people don't know what the truth is, they&nbsp; come up with theories and then they design&nbsp;&nbsp; experiments to try them out. And similarly, if we&nbsp; can give models those same tools, then we could&nbsp;&nbsp; expect them to sort of improve recursively in an&nbsp; environment and potentially become much better&nbsp;&nbsp; than humans could be just by banging their head&nbsp; against reality or I guess metaphorical head. &nbsp; I guess I don't expect there to be a wall in terms&nbsp; of model's ability to improve themselves if we can&nbsp;&nbsp; give them access to the ability to be empirical.&nbsp; And I guess Anthropic, deeply in its DNA is&nbsp;&nbsp; an empirical company. We have a lot of physicists&nbsp; like Jared, who's our chief research officer who&nbsp;&nbsp; I've worked with a lot, was a professor of Black&nbsp; Hole Physics at Johns Hopkins, and I guess he&nbsp;&nbsp; technically still is, but on leave. Yeah, it's&nbsp; in our DNA and yeah, I guess that's the RLAIF. &nbsp; Let me just follow this thread on, in terms&nbsp; of bottleneck, this is kind of a tangent,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just what is the biggest bottleneck&nbsp; today on model intelligence improvement? &nbsp; The stupid answer is data centers and power chips.&nbsp; I think if we had 10 times as many chips and had&nbsp;&nbsp; the data centers to power them, then maybe&nbsp; we wouldn't go 10 times faster, but it would&nbsp;&nbsp; be a real significant speed boost. It's actually very much scaling loss,&nbsp;&nbsp; just more compute. Yeah, I think that's a big one. And then the&nbsp;&nbsp; people really matter. We have great researchers&nbsp; and many of them have made really significant&nbsp;&nbsp; contributions to the science of how the models&nbsp; improve. And so it's like compute, algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp; and data. Those are the three ingredients in the&nbsp; scaling laws. And just to make that concrete,&nbsp;&nbsp; before we had transformers, we had LSTMs and we've&nbsp; done scaling laws on what the exponent is on those&nbsp;&nbsp; two things. And we found that for transformers,&nbsp; the exponent is higher. And making changes&nbsp;&nbsp; like that where as you increase scale, you also&nbsp; increase your ability to squeeze out intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those kinds of things are super impactful. And so having more researchers who can do&nbsp;&nbsp; better science and find out how do we squeeze out&nbsp; more gains is another one. And then with the rise&nbsp;&nbsp; of reinforcement learning, the efficiency with&nbsp; which these things run on chips also matters a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot. We've seen in the industry a 10X decrease in&nbsp; cost for a given amount of intelligence through a&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of algorithmic data and efficiency&nbsp; improvements. And if that continues, in three&nbsp;&nbsp; years we'll have 1,000 deck smarter models for&nbsp; the same price. Kind of hard to imagine, &nbsp; I forget where I heard this, but it's amazing&nbsp; that so many innovations came together at the&nbsp;&nbsp; same time to allow for this sort of thing and&nbsp; continue to progress where one thing isn't just&nbsp;&nbsp; slowing everything down like we're out of some&nbsp; rare earth mineral or we just can't optimize&nbsp;&nbsp; reinforcement learning more. It's amazing that we&nbsp; continue to find improvements and there isn't one&nbsp;&nbsp; thing that's just slowing everything down. Yeah, I think it really is just a combination&nbsp;&nbsp; of everything probably will hit a wall at some&nbsp; point. I guess in semiconductors. My brother works&nbsp;&nbsp; in the semiconductor industry and he was telling&nbsp; me that you can't actually shrink the size of the&nbsp;&nbsp; transistors anymore because the way semiconductors&nbsp; work is you dope silicon with other elements and&nbsp;&nbsp; the doping process would result in either zero&nbsp; or one atom of the doped elements inside a single&nbsp;&nbsp; fin because they're so, so, so tiny. Oh my God. &nbsp; And that's just wild to think of, and yet Moore's&nbsp; law somehow continues in some form. And so yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; there are these theoretical physics&nbsp; constraints that people are starting to run&nbsp;&nbsp; into and yet they're finding ways around it. We've got to start using parallel universes for&nbsp;&nbsp; some of this stuff. I guess so. &nbsp; Okay, I want to zoom out and talk about just&nbsp; Ben, Ben as a human for a moment before we get&nbsp;&nbsp; to a very exciting lightning round. I imagine&nbsp; just kind of the burden of feeling responsible&nbsp;&nbsp; for safe superintelligence is a heavy one.&nbsp; It feels like you're in a place where you&nbsp;&nbsp; can make a significant impact on the future of&nbsp; safety and AI. That's a lot of weight to carry.&nbsp;&nbsp; How does that just impact you personally,&nbsp; impact your life, how you see the world? &nbsp; There's this book that I read in 2019 that really&nbsp; informs how I think about sort of working with&nbsp;&nbsp; these very weighty topics called Replacing&nbsp; Guilt by Nate Soares. And he describes a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of different techniques for kind of working&nbsp; through this kind of thing. And he's actually&nbsp;&nbsp; the executive director at MIRI, the Machine&nbsp; Intelligence Research Institute, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; an AI safety tank that I worked at for a couple&nbsp; of months actually. And one of the things he talks&nbsp;&nbsp; about is this thing called resting in motion where&nbsp; some people think that the default state is rest,&nbsp;&nbsp; but actually that was never in the state of&nbsp; evolutionary adaptation. I really doubt that&nbsp;&nbsp; that was true. Where in nature, in the wilderness&nbsp; being hunter-gatherers and it's really unlikely&nbsp;&nbsp; that we evolved to just be at leisure, probably&nbsp; always have something to worry about of defending&nbsp;&nbsp; the tribe and finding enough food to survive&nbsp; and taking care of the children, dealing- &nbsp; Spreading our genes. And so I think about that as&nbsp;&nbsp; the busy state is the normal state and to try to&nbsp; work at a sustainable pace that it's a marathon,&nbsp;&nbsp; not a sprint, that's one thing that helps. And&nbsp; then just being around like-minded people that&nbsp;&nbsp; also care. It's not a thing that any of us can&nbsp; do alone. And Anthropic has incredible talent&nbsp;&nbsp; density. One of the things I love the most about&nbsp; our culture here is that it's very egoless. People&nbsp;&nbsp; just want the right thing to happen and I think&nbsp; that's another big reason that the mega offers&nbsp;&nbsp; from other companies tend to bounce off because&nbsp; people just love being here and they care. &nbsp; That's amazing. I don't know how you do it. I'd be&nbsp; extremely stressed. I'm going to try this resting&nbsp;&nbsp; in motion strategy. Okay, so you've been at&nbsp; Anthropic for a long time. From the very beginning&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reading there were 7 employees back in 2020.&nbsp; Today there's over 1,000, I don't know what the&nbsp;&nbsp; latest number is, but I know it's over 1,000. I've&nbsp; heard also that you've done basically every job&nbsp;&nbsp; at Anthropic, you made big contributions to a lot&nbsp; of the core products, the brand, the team hiring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just ask I guess what's most changed&nbsp; over that period? What is most different from&nbsp;&nbsp; the beginning days and which of those jobs that&nbsp; you've had over the years have you most loved? &nbsp; I probably had 15 different roles, honestly.&nbsp; I was head of security for a bit. I managed&nbsp;&nbsp; the Ops team when our president was on mat&nbsp; leave, I was crawling around under tables,&nbsp;&nbsp; plugging in HDMI cords and doing pen testing on&nbsp; our building. And I started our product team from&nbsp;&nbsp; scratch and convinced the whole company that&nbsp; we needed to have a product instead of just&nbsp;&nbsp; being a research company. Yeah, it's been a lot.&nbsp; All of it very fun. I think my favorite role in&nbsp;&nbsp; that time has been when I started the labs team&nbsp; about a year ago, whose fundamental goal was to&nbsp;&nbsp; do transfer from research to end user products&nbsp; and experiences. Because fundamentally I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the way that Anthropic can differentiate itself&nbsp; and really win is to be on the cutting edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have access to the latest, greatest stuff&nbsp; that's happening and I think honestly through&nbsp;&nbsp; our safety research we have a big opportunity to&nbsp; do things that no other company can safely do. &nbsp; For example, with computer use, I think&nbsp; that's going to be our huge opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp; basically to make it possible for an agent&nbsp; to use all your credentials on your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp; there has to be a huge amount of trust and to me&nbsp; we need to basically solve safety to make that&nbsp;&nbsp; happen. Safety and alignment. I'm pretty bullish&nbsp; on that kind of thing and I think we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp; see really cool stuff coming out soonish. Yeah,&nbsp; just leading that team has been so fun. MCP came&nbsp;&nbsp; out of that team and Claude Code came out of that&nbsp; team. And the people who I hired are like combo,&nbsp;&nbsp; have been a founder and also have been at&nbsp; big companies and seeing how things work at&nbsp;&nbsp; scale. It's just been an incredible team to&nbsp; work with and figure out the future with. &nbsp; I want to hear more about this. Team actually the&nbsp; person that connected us, the reason we're doing&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a mutual friend colleague Raph Lee who&nbsp; I used to work with at Airbnb now works on this&nbsp;&nbsp; team, leads a lot of this work and so he wanted&nbsp; me to make sure I asked about this team because...&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't realize all these things came out&nbsp; that team. Holy moly. What else should people&nbsp;&nbsp; know about this team? It used to be called&nbsp; Labs, I think it's called Frontiers now. &nbsp; That's right. Yeah. Cool. The idea here is&nbsp;&nbsp; this team works with the latest technologies&nbsp; that you guys have built and explores what&nbsp;&nbsp; is possible. Is that the general idea? Yeah, and I guess I was part of Google's&nbsp;&nbsp; Area 120 and I've read about Bell Labs and&nbsp; how to make these innovation teams work. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; really hard to do right and I wouldn't&nbsp; say that we've done everything right,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I think we've done some serious innovation on&nbsp; the state-of-the-art from company design and Raph&nbsp;&nbsp; has been right at the center of that. When I was&nbsp; first fitting up the team, the first thing I did&nbsp;&nbsp; was hire a great manager and that was Raph. And so&nbsp; he's definitely been crucial in building the team&nbsp;&nbsp; and helping it operate well. And we defined some&nbsp; operating models like the journey of an idea from&nbsp;&nbsp; prototype to product and how should graduation&nbsp; of products and projects work, how do teams&nbsp;&nbsp; do sprint models that are effective and make&nbsp; sure that they're working on the right ambition&nbsp;&nbsp; level of thing. That's been really exciting. I guess concretely we think about skating to&nbsp;&nbsp; where the puck is going and what that looks&nbsp; like is really understand the exponential.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's this great study that METR has done that&nbsp; Beth Barnes is the CEO of that organization and&nbsp;&nbsp; shows how long a time horizon of software&nbsp; engineering task can be done and just really&nbsp;&nbsp; internalizing that of, okay, don't build for&nbsp; today, build for six months from now, build&nbsp;&nbsp; for a year from now. And the things that aren't&nbsp; quite working that are working 20% of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; will start working 100% of the time. And I&nbsp; think that's really what made Claude Code&nbsp;&nbsp; a success that we thought people are not going&nbsp; to be locked to their IDEs forever. People are&nbsp;&nbsp; not going to be auto completing. People will&nbsp; be doing everything that a software engineer&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to do and a terminal is a great place&nbsp; to do that because a terminal can live in&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of places. A terminal can live on your&nbsp; local machine, it can live in GitHub actions,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can live on a remote machine in your cluster. That's sort of the leverage point for us&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was a lot of the inspiration.&nbsp; I think that's what the labs team tries&nbsp;&nbsp; to think about. Are we AGI-pilled enough? What a fun place to be. By the way, fun fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; Raph was my first manager at Airbnb when I joined.&nbsp; I was an engineer and he was my first manager. It&nbsp;&nbsp; all worked out. Cool.
