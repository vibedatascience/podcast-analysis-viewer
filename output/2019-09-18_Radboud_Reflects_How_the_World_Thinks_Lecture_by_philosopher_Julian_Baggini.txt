How the World Thinks | Lecture by philosopher Julian Baggini 
Monday 16 September 2019 | 19.30 â€“ 21.00 hrs. | Collegezalencomplex, Radboud Universiteit 
Radboud Reflects and Publisher Nieuw Amsterdam
Why is the West more individualistic than the East? And why does secularism have less influence in the Islamic world than in Europe? According to British philosopher Julian Baggini, we do not differ from each other as much as we think. All around the world, people grapple with the same moral questions. Individual autonomy versus collective good. The social demand for a clear truth versus the awareness that everything is subjective. The different ways of thinking are found in the answers. Come listen and hear from Baggini what we can learn from how the rest of the world thinks.

got this typical I hate this I've got this typical I hate this typical thing when you start talking and typical thing when you start talking and then you press the button and it doesn't then you press the button and it doesn't move move move I should be pressing it where should I I should be pressing it where should I be pointing it there okay maybe that's be pointing it there okay maybe that's it okay oh here we go it okay oh here we go marvellous so global philosophy around marvellous so global philosophy around the world global philosophy what are we the world global philosophy what are we talking about well most people will talking about well most people will first of all think about the great first of all think about the great traditions which have an ancient history traditions which have an ancient history and with that ancient history a long and with that ancient history a long history of written texts and there were history of written texts and there were sort of three major traditions which we sort of three major traditions which we can describe in those ways the one we're can describe in those ways the one we're most familiar with probably most is most most familiar with probably most is most familiar with is the Western tradition familiar with is the Western tradition which began in in Greece with figures which began in in Greece with figures like Socrates that were of course people like Socrates that were of course people before Socrates but the real flowering before Socrates but the real flowering of philosophy really began then what's of philosophy really began then what's quite interesting is that this roughly quite interesting is that this roughly the same time as we had philosophy the same time as we had philosophy emerging as a distinct subject in in emerging as a distinct subject in in Europe very really very close in time in Europe very really very close in time in other parts of the world something other parts of the world something similar happened so Confucius was around similar happened so Confucius was around five five one five five one BCE in China and again I mean Confucius BCE in China and again I mean Confucius was was said he was only recording the was was said he was only recording the wisdom of the Ancients so they're kind wisdom of the Ancients so they're kind of was something like philosophy before of was something like philosophy before but it was only with Confucius that it but it was only with Confucius that it started again to be to be written down started again to be to be written down formalized become the kind of thing we'd formalized become the kind of thing we'd recognize as philosophy today in the recognize as philosophy today in the Indian subcontinent Indian subcontinent Indian subcontinent there's the the the texts which are there's the the the texts which are still the basis of a lot of Indian still the basis of a lot of Indian philosophy were much older than this a philosophy were much older than this a lot of the ancient Vedas but it was lot of the ancient Vedas but it was really around the time of the Buddha and really around the time of the Buddha and the time of the Buddha is somewhat the time of the Buddha is somewhat unclear but let's say roughly around 480 unclear but let's say roughly around 480 BCE the this these texts started to be BCE the this these texts started to be discussed and also criticized and discussed and also criticized and reacted against in a recognizably reacted against in a recognizably philosophical way well not just philosophical way well not just mythology as an argument and so forth so mythology as an argument and so forth so these these three traditions are I guess these these three traditions are I guess what we think of as the the three core what we think of as the the three core global traditions of philosophy the global traditions of philosophy the interactions between them are very interactions between them are very limited there were there was there was limited there were there was there was you know trade between the Mediterranean you know trade between the Mediterranean and India around this time so it's and India around this time so it's always possible that there was some always possible that there was some intellectual exchange but the intellectual exchange but the scholarship on this is somewhat scholarship on this is somewhat inconclusive so it's not clear it's not inconclusive so it's not clear it's not it's already proven that there was any it's already proven that there was any great intellectual exchange that went on great intellectual exchange that went on the Buddhist idea is certainly the Buddhist idea is certainly transmitted across Asia over time transmitted across Asia over time changing as they went through China and changing as they went through China and to Japan but one of the other really to Japan but one of the other really interesting transmissions which is often interesting transmissions which is often understated in history of Western understated in history of Western philosophy is that a lot of the ancient philosophy is that a lot of the ancient Greek texts came to Europe via the Greek texts came to Europe via the Islamic world in the Middle Ages there Islamic world in the Middle Ages there was this so-called Islamic Golden Age was this so-called Islamic Golden Age where some great philosophers like Ivy where some great philosophers like Ivy say no and so forth and the Islamic say no and so forth and the Islamic world extended into southern Spain and world extended into southern Spain and these Islamic philosophers translated these Islamic philosophers translated Aristotle and Aristotle and Aristotle and commentaries on him and developed his commentaries on him and developed his ideas and it's actually often thanks to ideas and it's actually often thanks to them that we actually a lot of people in them that we actually a lot of people in the West got to transmit the the West got to transmit the transmission of these texts and this transmission of these texts and this tradition itself the the sort of Islamic tradition itself the the sort of Islamic philosophical tradition is a kind of a philosophical tradition is a kind of a fourth major tradition now in I'm not fourth major tradition now in I'm not showing you anything that American the showing you anything that American the Americas here because this map Americas here because this map represents where we have these ancient represents where we have these ancient or at least very old in the case of or at least very old in the case of Islamic philosophy written traditions Islamic philosophy written traditions but there is an argument the in addition but there is an argument the in addition to this you do find philosophy to this you do find philosophy transmitted orally in places like Africa transmitted orally in places like Africa in places like Australia New Zealand and in places like Australia New Zealand and so forth this is a very interesting area so forth this is a very interesting area because until quite recently people because until quite recently people really didn't consider the ideas and really didn't consider the ideas and concepts that were transmitted orally in concepts that were transmitted orally in these cultures is really being these cultures is really being philosophy people thought it was folk philosophy people thought it was folk wisdom whatever you might call it but in wisdom whatever you might call it but in recent decades there's been much more recent decades there's been much more interest in discussing the ideas that interest in discussing the ideas that have come for fare as real genuine have come for fare as real genuine philosophy and in my book I wanted to do philosophy and in my book I wanted to do a little bit of that as well now I'll a little bit of that as well now I'll give you that background because this give you that background because this would seem to be it's very basic history would seem to be it's very basic history it's something everyone anyone could it's something everyone anyone could look up very quickly but what is look up very quickly but what is striking is that you know I am striking is that you know I am philosopher I did a PhD in philosophy I philosopher I did a PhD in philosophy I I've spent my whole life writing and I've spent my whole life writing and reading about philosophy but of course reading about philosophy but of course what I studied didn't wasn't this it was what I studied didn't wasn't this it was this stuff it was only the kind of this stuff it was only the kind of philosophy that came from this part of philosophy that came from this part of the world and later on over North the world and later on over North America Canada right Western philosophy America Canada right Western philosophy is what most philosophy in Western is what most philosophy in Western universities is if you want to study universities is if you want to study Indian philosophy or Chinese philosophy Indian philosophy or Chinese philosophy you have to go into a an area studies you have to go into a an area studies department you have to department you have to go into Indian studies or Chinese go into Indian studies or Chinese studies whatever it might be and I I was studies whatever it might be and I I was not unusual in knowing almost nothing not unusual in knowing almost nothing about philosophy outside of the Western about philosophy outside of the Western tradition that was completely normal and tradition that was completely normal and is still completely normal for anyone is still completely normal for anyone who calls themselves a philosopher in who calls themselves a philosopher in the Western world now if I say that to the Western world now if I say that to you and you're not yourself immersed in you and you're not yourself immersed in philosophy you might think this is philosophy you might think this is absolutely astonishingly disgraceful how absolutely astonishingly disgraceful how how can it be the people whose academic how can it be the people whose academic and intellectual life is based around and intellectual life is based around philosophy limit themselves to only philosophy limit themselves to only Western philosophy I mean no one would Western philosophy I mean no one would do that if they were you know no one do that if they were you know no one known to say yeah ah she's only if you known to say yeah ah she's only if you studied art you wouldn't only study studied art you wouldn't only study Western art I mean maybe you would have Western art I mean maybe you would have done in the nineteenth century but you done in the nineteenth century but you know not it not in the 21st so what's know not it not in the 21st so what's the justification is it just a kind of a the justification is it just a kind of a racism or prejudice what is it now the racism or prejudice what is it now the argument that is usually used to defend argument that is usually used to defend the narrow scope of philosophy in the narrow scope of philosophy in Western universities is that actually Western universities is that actually what we call philosophy is a very what we call philosophy is a very specific discipline which is this thing specific discipline which is this thing which came out of ancient Greece the which came out of ancient Greece the word philosophy is itself obviously from word philosophy is itself obviously from the Greek philosophy a love of wisdom the Greek philosophy a love of wisdom and philosophy just is that tradition of and philosophy just is that tradition of thought now we talk about Chinese thought now we talk about Chinese philosophy and we talk about Indian philosophy and we talk about Indian philosophy but in a way we this is philosophy but in a way we this is misleading we now use the same word but misleading we now use the same word but we're using one word to actually we're using one word to actually describe very different things the describe very different things the tradition of thought in India in the tradition of thought in India in the Indian subcontinent and the traditions Indian subcontinent and the traditions of thought in China and elsewhere are of thought in China and elsewhere are not really philosophy as we know it and not really philosophy as we know it and in fact you could even say that I mean in fact you could even say that I mean in China and Japan for exam in China and Japan for exam for the words that I used for philosophy for the words that I used for philosophy were both invented they were they were were both invented they were they were created in the 19th century in response created in the 19th century in response to the interaction with Western to the interaction with Western philosophy they had to create a word to philosophy they had to create a word to describe this discipline and over time describe this discipline and over time it has come to describe their own it has come to describe their own thought - so the story is the reassuring thought - so the story is the reassuring story is it's not racism it's not story is it's not racism it's not prejudice it's just that philosophy as prejudice it's just that philosophy as we know it is this tradition which came we know it is this tradition which came out of the West there were other out of the West there were other traditions of thought elsewhere we have traditions of thought elsewhere we have no problem with them they're very good no problem with them they're very good they're very interesting but they're they're very interesting but they're just not philosophy right now that's the just not philosophy right now that's the story that I was told and it's a story I story that I was told and it's a story I I kind of I believed really and partly I kind of I believed really and partly because if I did have a look at because if I did have a look at some Chinese philosophy or Indian some Chinese philosophy or Indian philosophy really did look very philosophy really did look very different and it didn't seem to be what different and it didn't seem to be what we were doing so it's very easy to kind we were doing so it's very easy to kind of reassure oneself that actually it's of reassure oneself that actually it's okay not to study this it's just okay not to study this it's just different different different but over time I became more and more but over time I became more and more uncomfortable with this and it's partly uncomfortable with this and it's partly because of course a lot of there are because of course a lot of there are more and more people who are doing more and more people who are doing comparative philosophy who are pointing comparative philosophy who are pointing out of hell actually the resemblance out of hell actually the resemblance between things you find in these other between things you find in these other traditions and Western philosophy is too traditions and Western philosophy is too strong to say they're just different I strong to say they're just different I mean some of these similarities are very mean some of these similarities are very striking the the philosophy of Confucius striking the the philosophy of Confucius for example it is so similar in so many for example it is so similar in so many respects to the philosophy of Aristotle respects to the philosophy of Aristotle though it seem crazy to say that these though it seem crazy to say that these you know one thing is philosophy the you know one thing is philosophy the other thing is folk wisdom or whatever other thing is folk wisdom or whatever that might be so I I became convinced that might be so I I became convinced that this was not sustainable and that that this was not sustainable and that if you were interested in the big if you were interested in the big questions of philosophy you really ought questions of philosophy you really ought to to to these tries have some look at what goes these tries have some look at what goes on outside your own tradition and I on outside your own tradition and I actually I am a freelance writer I earn actually I am a freelance writer I earn my living from writing and I was very I my living from writing and I was very I decided I needed to find out more about decided I needed to find out more about it and rather conveniently actually it and rather conveniently actually there just simply wasn't any kind of there just simply wasn't any kind of book of the kind that I wanted to write book of the kind that I wanted to write that people could read if they were that people could read if they were interesting to so at this a nice interesting to so at this a nice marriage of what I was interested in marriage of what I was interested in doing and a book that perhaps needed to doing and a book that perhaps needed to be written right now so that's good so be written right now so that's good so so that's all very well so I started out so that's all very well so I started out as someone who is interested in as someone who is interested in philosophy realizing I should try and philosophy realizing I should try and broaden my horizons but as the project broaden my horizons but as the project developed I came to see that this was developed I came to see that this was actually more interesting than just if actually more interesting than just if you're interested in a philosophy I had you're interested in a philosophy I had a question the question was would a question the question was would understanding something of the understanding something of the philosophical tradition of a culture philosophical tradition of a culture tell you anything about how that culture tell you anything about how that culture is today and it's a question that I put is today and it's a question that I put to people because one thing you may to people because one thing you may already be thinking is how can you write already be thinking is how can you write a book about all the philosophy in the a book about all the philosophy in the world right because clearly I'm not 372 world right because clearly I'm not 372 years old which is probably the minimum years old which is probably the minimum time it would take to become an expert time it would take to become an expert on these things no I did it because I on these things no I did it because I write there's almost like a journalist a write there's almost like a journalist a philosophical journalist I have my philosophical journalist I have my philosophical background I do also write philosophical background I do also write journalism and the way to write this journalism and the way to write this book was to actually read the core texts book was to actually read the core texts read the central canonical texts but read the central canonical texts but also speak to a lot of people who were also speak to a lot of people who were real experts in the area and try to pull real experts in the area and try to pull out what was most interesting so that's out what was most interesting so that's how I'm able to write out not pretending how I'm able to write out not pretending to you that I have become an expert on to you that I have become an expert on all the world's philosophies but when I all the world's philosophies but when I spoke to these people these experts spoke to these people these experts people who worked usually were working people who worked usually were working in the region where their philosophy was in the region where their philosophy was from I from I from I I asked him that question do you think I asked him that question do you think that understanding the philosophical that understanding the philosophical tradition helps you to understand the tradition helps you to understand the culture and they all basically said yes culture and they all basically said yes and as time went by I could see how that and as time went by I could see how that was the case so in this talk I just want was the case so in this talk I just want to really give a couple of examples of to really give a couple of examples of that just just just two examples of how that just just just two examples of how there are two very interesting there are two very interesting philosophical ideas in non-western philosophical ideas in non-western traditions but also how finding out traditions but also how finding out about them shows us something about them shows us something interesting about those cultures today interesting about those cultures today but then which but then also tells us but then which but then also tells us something interesting about the Western something interesting about the Western culture and tradition as well because culture and tradition as well because seeing our own tradition in contrast seeing our own tradition in contrast sheds new light on him and before I do sheds new light on him and before I do that though I do want to point out there that though I do want to point out there are lots of dangers in doing this kind are lots of dangers in doing this kind of thing taking a broad sweep of global of thing taking a broad sweep of global philosophies and so I have these deadly philosophies and so I have these deadly sins of comparative philosophy the first sins of comparative philosophy the first is what I'd call domesticating so this is what I'd call domesticating so this is when you come across an idea or is when you come across an idea or concept a way of thinking from another concept a way of thinking from another culture and it's a bit different and culture and it's a bit different and what you what you end up doing is you what you what you end up doing is you just translate it into something just translate it into something familiar and you just make it really familiar and you just make it really just a variation of something in your just a variation of something in your own tradition right that's kind of too own tradition right that's kind of too easy it's too simple it's not as easy it's too simple it's not as straightforward as that but then there's straightforward as that but then there's an there's an opposite mistake which is an there's an opposite mistake which is exotic izing it's where you kind of exotic izing it's where you kind of imagine that the ways of thinking imagine that the ways of thinking outside of Europe are so radically outside of Europe are so radically different that you end up imagining the different that you end up imagining the you know other parts of the world are you know other parts of the world are almost like alien species you know and almost like alien species you know and this is something that people often do this is something that people often do in a way that they faith they think is a in a way that they faith they think is a positive a lot of people I don't know positive a lot of people I don't know whether it's the same in the Netherlands whether it's the same in the Netherlands but but there's a kind of a cliche that but but there's a kind of a cliche that people say the Indians are such people say the Indians are such spiritual people right and it's like I spiritual people right and it's like I kind of see what they mean I mean in the kind of see what they mean I mean in the sense that I think it is true sense that I think it is true religion and that kind of spiritual life religion and that kind of spiritual life if you like is more dominant in Indian if you like is more dominant in Indian culture than it is in most Western culture than it is in most Western cultures now but but then people kind of cultures now but but then people kind of imagine this sort of means that I don't imagine this sort of means that I don't know if our Indians are sort of like a know if our Indians are sort of like a almost like a different type of human almost like a different type of human being who exists on this spiritual realm being who exists on this spiritual realm in which they have no concern with in which they have no concern with material matters or something which is material matters or something which is obviously not true especially if you obviously not true especially if you look at how much they money they spend look at how much they money they spend trying to get their children a very good trying to get their children a very good education so they can get a good job a education so they can get a good job a lot of the time you know so lot of the time you know so domesticating so you got to avoid those domesticating so you got to avoid those two OP equal and opposite mistakes two OP equal and opposite mistakes imagining that really everyone has imagining that really everyone has exactly the same ideas all over the exactly the same ideas all over the world or the idea that everyone's so world or the idea that everyone's so radically different that we can't learn radically different that we can't learn from each other you've got to get the from each other you've got to get the balance between those two things and the balance between those two things and the third mistake is what you called third mistake is what you called essentializing now already in this talk essentializing now already in this talk you know I've talked about China the you know I've talked about China the Indian subcontinent the West I'm using Indian subcontinent the West I'm using these very very broad categories and these very very broad categories and obviously you know think about it for obviously you know think about it for one second we realize there's something one second we realize there's something potentially very wrong about that and potentially very wrong about that and the essentializing mistake is to kind of the essentializing mistake is to kind of imagine there's a kind of there's a way imagine there's a kind of there's a way of thinking or a way of being which kind of thinking or a way of being which kind of all say Indians have and have always of all say Indians have and have always had and that all Westerners haven't had and that all Westerners haven't always had and it's obviously more always had and it's obviously more complicated than that there is a lot of complicated than that there is a lot of diversity within traditions and cultures diversity within traditions and cultures and traditions and cultures change over and traditions and cultures change over time that's true but it is it is still time that's true but it is it is still possible to make some general comments possible to make some general comments about traditions and cultures if I might about traditions and cultures if I might give a simple example if I were to say give a simple example if I were to say that men are taller than women right you that men are taller than women right you can understand that sentence in a way can understand that sentence in a way which is perfectly true and which is perfectly true and understandable always nonsense if you understandable always nonsense if you think I mean that all think I mean that all are taller than all women as obviously are taller than all women as obviously false it's crazy right false it's crazy right but we know the statement is about but we know the statement is about averages it's about tendencies and averages it's about tendencies and that's kind of the same way you've got that's kind of the same way you've got to think about when are in this talk to think about when are in this talk when I have to wear Indian philosophy when I have to wear Indian philosophy Chinese philosophy I'm never saying Chinese philosophy I'm never saying something which is true of all Chinese something which is true of all Chinese philosophers all Indian philosophers all philosophers all Indian philosophers all of the cultures we're talking about of the cultures we're talking about things which are more dominant more things which are more dominant more common because there are I think real common because there are I think real differences between cultures but those differences between cultures but those differences are matters of what has most differences are matters of what has most emphasis if you like one of the most emphasis if you like one of the most useful sentences that I read when useful sentences that I read when researching this book was by Tom Kha researching this book was by Tom Kha Sulis who is a comparative philosopher Sulis who is a comparative philosopher who works on Japanese philosophy and he who works on Japanese philosophy and he says what you've got I'm paraphrasing says what you've got I'm paraphrasing but what he essentially says is that but what he essentially says is that when you look at different traditions of when you look at different traditions of thought you should never make the thought you should never make the mistake of thinking you know it's mistake of thinking you know it's either/or and black and white it's either/or and black and white it's rather the case that what is in the rather the case that what is in the background in one culture is in the background in one culture is in the foreground in another and vice versa foreground in another and vice versa right so it is true and I'm convinced of right so it is true and I'm convinced of this that different things are this that different things are foregrounded and emphasized in different foregrounded and emphasized in different traditions of thought and in different traditions of thought and in different cultures and that's one of the reasons cultures and that's one of the reasons why it's so interesting to pay attention why it's so interesting to pay attention to them because some what you're really to them because some what you're really noticing is not just something which is noticing is not just something which is interesting about another culture but interesting about another culture but you're often noticing something which is you're often noticing something which is in the background of your own which in the background of your own which perhaps we should pay more attention to perhaps we should pay more attention to so I'd say want to just give us two two so I'd say want to just give us two two examples the first example is the if you examples the first example is the if you read anything about Chinese philosophy read anything about Chinese philosophy then the one concept which will almost then the one concept which will almost certainly be discussed is the idea of certainly be discussed is the idea of harmony or harmony is the translation of harmony or harmony is the translation of the term it turns up everywhere this is the term it turns up everywhere this is actually actually actually International School in Beijing which International School in Beijing which has find your harmony as its slogan I'd has find your harmony as its slogan I'd before I went I did I was lucky to do before I went I did I was lucky to do some traveling for the book and I did go some traveling for the book and I did go briefly to China and I had read about briefly to China and I had read about the importance of harmony and how the importance of harmony and how central it was not just in Chinese central it was not just in Chinese philosophy but also in Chinese culture philosophy but also in Chinese culture and I was a little bit skeptical I and I was a little bit skeptical I thought you know really this is this is thought you know really this is this is something you get in Confucius a lot and something you get in Confucius a lot and the Confucian thinkers was it really the Confucian thinkers was it really important in society and actually even important in society and actually even just a short visit you could see that it just a short visit you could see that it was I mean in conversation people would was I mean in conversation people would spontaneously use the word to talk about spontaneously use the word to talk about desirable states of affairs and desirable states of affairs and english-language newspapers it was english-language newspapers it was always being used in in government always being used in in government announcements and also in commentaries announcements and also in commentaries now what what is harmony it's the now what what is harmony it's the English word but what does it mean in English word but what does it mean in history bye bye this is this is the history bye bye this is this is the temple of Confucius this is into food temple of Confucius this is into food and these are the this is a gate of and these are the this is a gate of harmony there if you go to the Forbidden harmony there if you go to the Forbidden City in Beijing there's a hall of City in Beijing there's a hall of supreme harmony there's a whole of supreme harmony there's a whole of central harmony the whole of preserving central harmony the whole of preserving harmony it really is everywhere but what harmony it really is everywhere but what does it mean harmony now you might be does it mean harmony now you might be suspicious you might think that what we suspicious you might think that what we know what we think we know know what we know what we think we know about Chinese culture not just now but about Chinese culture not just now but historically is first of all that it's historically is first of all that it's very hierarchical Confucian thought is very hierarchical Confucian thought is hierarchical and in the current system hierarchical and in the current system is somewhat authoritarianism government is somewhat authoritarianism government so harmony you might think is actually so harmony you might think is actually sounds like a very nice word well what sounds like a very nice word well what it actually means is conformity because it actually means is conformity because again this is a very typical image again this is a very typical image I think Westerners have of not just I think Westerners have of not just Chinese society but a lot of East Asian Chinese society but a lot of East Asian societies they're basically about societies they're basically about conformism and uniformity and obeying conformism and uniformity and obeying superiors superiors superiors that's a simple way of looking at it so that's a simple way of looking at it so you might think that's what harmony it you might think that's what harmony it is isn't doesn't sound very good to me is isn't doesn't sound very good to me but if you actually look in the in the but if you actually look in the in the Confucian texts which by the way people Confucian texts which by the way people are very familiar with in the same kind are very familiar with in the same kind of way that people know Bible stories of way that people know Bible stories even if they're not Christians in lot of even if they're not Christians in lot of Western countries people know a lot of Western countries people know a lot of the key Confucian texts and that's the key Confucian texts and that's despite many years of them being despite many years of them being suppressed by the communist government suppressed by the communist government in the Confucian texts they explain that in the Confucian texts they explain that harmony is not meant to be about harmony is not meant to be about uniformity at all the way in which uniformity at all the way in which harmonies explained is by analogy and harmonies explained is by analogy and one of the analogies they have is super one of the analogies they have is super so think what makes for a good soup well so think what makes for a good soup well not uniformity if you just have soup not uniformity if you just have soup which is like cabbage and nothing else which is like cabbage and nothing else and water maybe you do have that here and water maybe you do have that here actually now I shouldn't be I shouldn't actually now I shouldn't be rude about Dutch food I'm from be rude about Dutch food I'm from England okay oh the other thing I should England okay oh the other thing I should say is I shouldn't say this really but say is I shouldn't say this really but for many for many years for many for many years British people went all around the world British people went all around the world feeling very superior and and with their feeling very superior and and with their with their very powerful pound and their with their very powerful pound and their empire and thinking they were great I empire and thinking they were great I have to say we've now come to a point in have to say we've now come to a point in Britain where if I go to anywhere else Britain where if I go to anywhere else in Europe now I feel I have to apologize in Europe now I feel I have to apologize for my country I'm sorry right so soup a for my country I'm sorry right so soup a nice soup not not an English soup not a nice soup not not an English soup not a British soup maybe a Dutch soup British soup maybe a Dutch soup certainly the Italian or Chinese soup certainly the Italian or Chinese soup well we'll have a variety of ingredients well we'll have a variety of ingredients it needs to have different elements it it needs to have different elements it needs to have the broth the spices the needs to have the broth the spices the herbs the vegetables the meat or herbs the vegetables the meat or whatever it might be in there it's the whatever it might be in there it's the diversity of the elements which enables diversity of the elements which enables to create the harmony the other metaphor to create the harmony the other metaphor this used is not surprisingly music this used is not surprisingly music again one instrument and one note or you again one instrument and one note or you have ten instruments playing the same have ten instruments playing the same notes that doesn't create a nice piece notes that doesn't create a nice piece of music you need different notes of music you need different notes different instruments harmony is created different instruments harmony is created by it all coming together so by it all coming together so the idea of harmony is one in which the idea of harmony is one in which difference is not only allowed it's difference is not only allowed it's actually required and there's an it as a actually required and there's an it as a Chinese idiom which says that sameness Chinese idiom which says that sameness is like a a dead pool of water it's not is like a a dead pool of water it's not not harmony at all so the Confucian not harmony at all so the Confucian value of harmony which is very important value of harmony which is very important in in Chinese society yes it's about the in in Chinese society yes it's about the desire of creating a family first of all desire of creating a family first of all within a society in a culture in which within a society in a culture in which everything is working smoothly together everything is working smoothly together but that's required but that's required that's that requires there to be that's that requires there to be differences within that it's not about differences within that it's not about uniformity so even though it's true for uniformity so even though it's true for example that in Confucian traditional example that in Confucian traditional Confucian ethics the relationship Confucian ethics the relationship between father and son in particular is between father and son in particular is very important and there is a duty of very important and there is a duty of son to father son to father there is also an obligation of the son there is also an obligation of the son to protest to remonstrate with the to protest to remonstrate with the father if the father is seen to be doing father if the father is seen to be doing wrong so it's actually not a simple wrong so it's actually not a simple matter of conformity and knowing your matter of conformity and knowing your place it's so it's but it is something place it's so it's but it is something which puts great value on be able to which puts great value on be able to manage the different elements in society manage the different elements in society and bring them together well now that's and bring them together well now that's in theory in in practice it doesn't in theory in in practice it doesn't always work like that of course when you always work like that of course when you hear the Chinese Communist Party today hear the Chinese Communist Party today talking about harmonization actually talking about harmonization actually often it is talking about imposing a often it is talking about imposing a kind of uniformity but that shouldn't kind of uniformity but that shouldn't surprise us well I think the important surprise us well I think the important thing to understand is that harmony is thing to understand is that harmony is the sensual political and social value the sensual political and social value within which sort of like in Chinese within which sort of like in Chinese society in Chinese politics understands society in Chinese politics understands itself and has its debates in the same itself and has its debates in the same kind of way that in the West is concepts kind of way that in the West is concepts around freedom and liberty which take around freedom and liberty which take center stage so if you're doing making center stage so if you're doing making any kind of political point if you're any kind of political point if you're trying to argue your case politically trying to argue your case politically you kind of have to you kind of have to convince people that your vision of convince people that your vision of things is the thing which is going to things is the thing which is going to maximize the liberty and freedom of all maximize the liberty and freedom of all now it may be that what you're now it may be that what you're advocating is actually not increasing advocating is actually not increasing freedom at all but that's not the point freedom at all but that's not the point that's the concept that you have to use that's the concept that you have to use at the very least in in the same way in at the very least in in the same way in China that's the concept that's used but China that's the concept that's used but if you take the value seriously I think if you take the value seriously I think you can see there's something very you can see there's something very interesting and important about it interesting and important about it because actually again we don't use the because actually again we don't use the word harmony very much it doesn't really word harmony very much it doesn't really occur in political philosophy very much occur in political philosophy very much doesn't occur in political discourse but doesn't occur in political discourse but if you think about it of course if you think about it of course everybody does want a harmonious nation everybody does want a harmonious nation a harmonious society we do want it but a harmonious society we do want it but we kind of lacked the concepts and the we kind of lacked the concepts and the theoretical background in order to theoretical background in order to articulate that so what happens we pay a articulate that so what happens we pay a price for that price for that because the price we pay for that is because the price we pay for that is that actually with all the emphasis on that actually with all the emphasis on liberty and freedom we don't perhaps liberty and freedom we don't perhaps notice how harmony is being undermined I notice how harmony is being undermined I can think again I hate to go back to the can think again I hate to go back to the example of my own country at the moment example of my own country at the moment but you know in the name of freedom and but you know in the name of freedom and liberty and democracy we created this liberty and democracy we created this referendum in which we gave the people referendum in which we gave the people the choice to choose the opportunity to the choice to choose the opportunity to choose what of course happens as a choose what of course happens as a result of this referendum is a result of this referendum is a completely divided nation and it divided completely divided nation and it divided in such a way that it's impossible to in such a way that it's impossible to satisfy both sides we unleashed these satisfy both sides we unleashed these forces of dis disharmony if we had been forces of dis disharmony if we had been more attentive to the idea that the goal more attentive to the idea that the goal of politics is not just to give people of politics is not just to give people the right to choose what they want to the right to choose what they want to choose which is important it's not only choose which is important it's not only about that if politics is also about about that if politics is also about maintaining our harmonious society we maintaining our harmonious society we would not have done something as crazy would not have done something as crazy as had a divisive referendum and in the as had a divisive referendum and in the same kind of way I think you can then same kind of way I think you can then look at look at look at I countries like China are not as I countries like China are not as enthusiastic about democracy and enthusiastic about democracy and individual human rights as people individual human rights as people thought that it would be people kind of thought that it would be people kind of thought that with economic development thought that with economic development you would get great of calls for you would get great of calls for individual liberty freedom and democracy individual liberty freedom and democracy well we have seen some of that and part well we have seen some of that and part of the reason why it's not gone further of the reason why it's not gone further is because of the one-party state for is because of the one-party state for sure but I think we also need to take sure but I think we also need to take seriously the idea that actually Chinese seriously the idea that actually Chinese people themselves are on the whole people themselves are on the whole perhaps a little bit wary of unleashing perhaps a little bit wary of unleashing sort of forces of individual liberty sort of forces of individual liberty which may have the consequence of which may have the consequence of undermining that social harmony and it's undermining that social harmony and it's not irrational for them to fear that not irrational for them to fear that it's not irrational at all this is not it's not irrational at all this is not to defend every policy decision of the to defend every policy decision of the Chinese Communist Party of course it Chinese Communist Party of course it isn't that but it's to help to isn't that but it's to help to understand why a resistance to the calls understand why a resistance to the calls for greater individual freedom and for greater individual freedom and rights may not be simply the consequence rights may not be simply the consequence of an all-powerful State it may be a of an all-powerful State it may be a fear that a China which is a huge and fear that a China which is a huge and diverse country could fall apart diverse country could fall apart essentially it could fall apart if these essentially it could fall apart if these forces are unleashed and if you don't forces are unleashed and if you don't find yourself sympathetic to that find yourself sympathetic to that thought I would suggest you perhaps thought I would suggest you perhaps think about how a lot of people in the think about how a lot of people in the West have been critical of Western West have been critical of Western foreign policy in places like the Middle foreign policy in places like the Middle East a lot of people have said these the East a lot of people have said these the mistake the mistake of this foreign mistake the mistake of this foreign policy decisions is precisely that we policy decisions is precisely that we thought it was important to bring thought it was important to bring freedom and democracy to countries and freedom and democracy to countries and of course all that actually happened was of course all that actually happened was we destroyed whatever cohesion they had we destroyed whatever cohesion they had and what they got was a chaos which and what they got was a chaos which didn't give them freedom or harmony didn't give them freedom or harmony so actually again without having that so actually again without having that sort of concept in mind of of harmony I sort of concept in mind of of harmony I think a lot of the reason people have think a lot of the reason people have been a critical of foreign policy by been a critical of foreign policy by Western governments it's precisely Western governments it's precisely because they can see the you know the because they can see the you know the goal of maximizing freedom is not to be goal of maximizing freedom is not to be pursued at all cost if the consequence pursued at all cost if the consequence is a lack of harmony so this is is a lack of harmony so this is obviously just a very short summary a obviously just a very short summary a short overview of this but I'm trying to short overview of this but I'm trying to give a flavor of how a different give a flavor of how a different tradition has a kind of a different part tradition has a kind of a different part of it has a concept of a core political of it has a concept of a core political and social and ethical concept that's and social and ethical concept that's simply not at the heart it's not in our simply not at the heart it's not in our tradition at all it not only helps to tradition at all it not only helps to understand a little bit about how that understand a little bit about how that culture works it also shines a light on culture works it also shines a light on our own culture and perhaps makes us our own culture and perhaps makes us think about what might be lacking a bit think about what might be lacking a bit I'm gonna give just one other example I'm gonna give just one other example very briefly and this concerns actually very briefly and this concerns actually you know what it means to be an you know what it means to be an individual and this is a very individual and this is a very interesting one because here is interesting one because here is something we're actually you learn as something we're actually you learn as much by studying the culture as you do much by studying the culture as you do by studying the philosophical texts so by studying the philosophical texts so in Japan in particular there's been a in Japan in particular there's been a lot of theoretical philosophy about the lot of theoretical philosophy about the self about identity about the individual self about identity about the individual but actually a lot of that is in a way but actually a lot of that is in a way as much describing the way in which the as much describing the way in which the self functions in these societies as it self functions in these societies as it is creating new theories now again from is creating new theories now again from the outside like I was saying before I the outside like I was saying before I think people have an image often of East think people have an image often of East Asian countries as being conformist Asian countries as being conformist that's the idea they're conformist we're that's the idea they're conformist we're individualist so this is like a shopping individualist so this is like a shopping district in Tokyo in which there's this district in Tokyo in which there's this very busy street and when when the very busy street and when when the lights change huge mass of people they lights change huge mass of people they cross the roads but you know you see it cross the roads but you know you see it from a distance and it's it's like this from a distance and it's it's like this perfectly ordered kind of movement of perfectly ordered kind of movement of people it seems to be so smooth that people it seems to be so smooth that there's that there's that there's that people almost see it as though it like people almost see it as though it like they're ants or insects or animals you they're ants or insects or animals you know everybody people moving as a herd know everybody people moving as a herd and this is this idea of that conformity and this is this idea of that conformity is really what's going on there that's is really what's going on there that's why it happens now it is obviously more why it happens now it is obviously more complicated than that complicated than that the central idea that you see the central idea that you see articulated in the philosophy and articulated in the philosophy and reflected in the culture about the self reflected in the culture about the self is that the self is essentially what we is that the self is essentially what we were called relational ok so the were called relational ok so the contrast has contrasted with the contrast has contrasted with the dominant Western idea of the self I dominant Western idea of the self I think it's fair to say that the dominant think it's fair to say that the dominant Western idea of the self is what we Western idea of the self is what we might call atomistic in other words we might call atomistic in other words we are all here a collection of individuals are all here a collection of individuals and what's primary is the individual and what's primary is the individual right you are as you know take Descartes right you are as you know take Descartes you know the cogito ergo sum I think you know the cogito ergo sum I think therefore I am therefore I am each individual is defined primarily by each individual is defined primarily by their own subjective consciousness and their own subjective consciousness and their own experience and these little their own experience and these little atoms these little selves can come atoms these little selves can come together and they can relate and they together and they can relate and they can organize but what's primary is the can organize but what's primary is the individual now in East Asian culture I individual now in East Asian culture I don't think it's quite the same it's not don't think it's quite the same it's not of course of course people recognize of course of course people recognize that individuals are separate from one that individuals are separate from one another but what's at the foreground at another but what's at the foreground at least traditionally it may be changing a least traditionally it may be changing a bit traditionally what's at the bit traditionally what's at the foreground is always how you are in foreground is always how you are in relation to others right now I really relation to others right now I really I've been talking to philosophers about I've been talking to philosophers about this I've been reading about it and what this I've been reading about it and what really made me get it it was when I was really made me get it it was when I was leaving Japan and I leaving Japan I was leaving Japan and I was on a plane a lot of Japanese people was on a plane a lot of Japanese people in the plane and I noticed that they in the plane and I noticed that they were all well Oh almost all were were all well Oh almost all were watching the same film I thought what's watching the same film I thought what's this film which everyone's in Japan this film which everyone's in Japan seems to be keen on at the moment so I seems to be keen on at the moment so I watched it with the subtitles and took watched it with the subtitles and took pictures to remind myself of a dialogue pictures to remind myself of a dialogue it was a film called orange which is it was a film called orange which is this is a teen romance it's a romance this is a teen romance it's a romance for teenagers right but it was not like for teenagers right but it was not like a Western teen romance at all and not a Western teen romance at all and not only because central to the plot were only because central to the plot were not one but two suicides right you don't not one but two suicides right you don't get many suicides in Hollywood teen get many suicides in Hollywood teen romances but what was really interesting romances but what was really interesting was it was it was a very complicated was it was it was a very complicated plot I can't go into details it has time plot I can't go into details it has time travel and everything but um the key the travel and everything but um the key the couple it the couple that it was based couple it the couple that it was based on actually you only saw the couple on actually you only saw the couple together alone in the film twice quite together alone in the film twice quite briefly I think now clearly that's not briefly I think now clearly that's not because there's a taboo against showing because there's a taboo against showing them alone if they were shown together them alone if they were shown together alone it's just that that's not how the alone it's just that that's not how the story works the story was all about the story works the story was all about the relation their relationship only evolved relation their relationship only evolved within the context of this friendship within the context of this friendship group this is a still from the film we group this is a still from the film we got the six kids and this this was the got the six kids and this this was the key point that there what there could be key point that there what there could be no as it were even even a romance no as it were even even a romance between two people could not occur in a between two people could not occur in a vacuum it could only occur in the vacuum it could only occur in the context of the social group and the context of the social group and the friendship group to the extent that in friendship group to the extent that in the plot I'm really looking at the clock the plot I'm really looking at the clock as if that's complicated what happens is as if that's complicated what happens is the boy kills himself he's news of the the boy kills himself he's news of the school he kills himself after his mother school he kills himself after his mother has killed himself and the children grow has killed himself and the children grow up and the girl marries one of the one up and the girl marries one of the boys and they have a child and of the boys and they have a child and they're very happy they're happy right they're very happy they're happy right but they discover a way of sending a but they discover a way of sending a message back in time to open up an message back in time to open up an alternative future in which something alternative future in which something else might happen and what they realized else might happen and what they realized was that first of all they let the boy was that first of all they let the boy down they let their friend down bye-bye down they let their friend down bye-bye when he died it wasn't him his act as an when he died it wasn't him his act as an atomistic individual you know for which atomistic individual you know for which they felt sorry but that's not they're they felt sorry but that's not they're at fault they felt responsible for it at fault they felt responsible for it because they realize that if an because they realize that if an individual commits suicide that that's individual commits suicide that that's only because of the context in which only because of the context in which they find themselves and they also they find themselves and they also realize that really the rights the best realize that really the rights the best match would have been him and the girl match would have been him and the girl so the husband of the woman the father so the husband of the woman the father of her child can conspire to try and of her child can conspire to try and arrange it so that in an alternative arrange it so that in an alternative future she gets together with somebody future she gets together with somebody else now that is not something you'll else now that is not something you'll get in any Western romance right but it get in any Western romance right but it shows you that thing this is the reason shows you that thing this is the reason I find this so interesting is that it's I find this so interesting is that it's not that the individuals lack not that the individuals lack individuality it's not the case at all individuality it's not the case at all each character even I know I don't each character even I know I don't understand Japanese I'm only following understand Japanese I'm only following the subtitles but I could see that all the subtitles but I could see that all these were very distinct characters these were very distinct characters there in school uniform that's why they there in school uniform that's why they look the same but they've all got their look the same but they've all got their very different styles and mannerisms very different styles and mannerisms they have individuality but the they have individuality but the individuality can only be expressed in a individuality can only be expressed in a social context where you understand that social context where you understand that you are only the person you are in you are only the person you are in relation to others and that to me relation to others and that to me help was to explain a lot of what from help was to explain a lot of what from the outside looks like conformist the outside looks like conformist behavior it's not actually conformist behavior it's not actually conformist behavior it's kind of pro-social behavior it's kind of pro-social behavior right people I think on a behavior right people I think on a day-to-day basis are genuinely more day-to-day basis are genuinely more aware of the other people around them aware of the other people around them it's as simple as that it's as simple as that now I notice this because Tokyo is a now I notice this because Tokyo is a busy city and you know I come from busy city and you know I come from Britain and after a couple of days this Britain and after a couple of days this sounds really strange I became aware sounds really strange I became aware that I was kind of walking around this that I was kind of walking around this city almost yeah he always saying city almost yeah he always saying physiological going I thought my physiological going I thought my shoulders are out of bear right I'm not shoulders are out of bear right I'm not literally pushing people out of the way literally pushing people out of the way but I have this kind of default way of but I have this kind of default way of moving around a city in which I'm trying moving around a city in which I'm trying to create space for myself I mean in to create space for myself I mean in competition with other people competition with other people the way other people were reacting the way other people were reacting gradually made me feel self-conscious gradually made me feel self-conscious about that and I realized I was wrong about that and I realized I was wrong and I kind of I let my shoulders down and I kind of I let my shoulders down and I I think I genuinely sort of became and I I think I genuinely sort of became a bit more pro-social myself making a bit more pro-social myself making space for other people I spoke to a space for other people I spoke to a philosopher who is half Japanese half philosopher who is half Japanese half American who's lived in both cultures American who's lived in both cultures and he said this is exactly correct the and he said this is exactly correct the Underground in Tokyo is very very busy Underground in Tokyo is very very busy right but you never have problems with right but you never have problems with space in the under guard even in a busy space in the under guard even in a busy space people make room for each other space people make room for each other it's as simple as that whereas on the it's as simple as that whereas on the New York underground New York underground it's very may remember that they put it's very may remember that they put signs up a few years ago to discourage signs up a few years ago to discourage because people were sitting in I have to because people were sitting in I have to do the demonstration people were sitting do the demonstration people were sitting in the chairs kind of like this they in the chairs kind of like this they call it man spreading you know people call it man spreading you know people take up huge amounts of space for take up huge amounts of space for themselves so again now remember I said themselves so again now remember I said before is about foreground and before is about foreground and background it's not that the Japanese background it's not that the Japanese have a completely different idea of what have a completely different idea of what it is to be an individual it's all about it is to be an individual it's all about your relations to others and it's your relations to others and it's nothing about your own individual self nothing about your own individual self it's not that but it was an important a it's not that but it was an important a really important difference in emphasis really important difference in emphasis and I think this is important first of and I think this is important first of all I think it helps us again to all I think it helps us again to understand what might seem strange in understand what might seem strange in another culture but also I think it's another culture but also I think it's useful for ourselves too because if we useful for ourselves too because if we think you know what what what are the think you know what what what are the problems with Western culture I've yet problems with Western culture I've yet to hear anybody say the problem with to hear anybody say the problem with Western culture is that it's not Western culture is that it's not individualistic enough most people think individualistic enough most people think we have a problem with an excess of we have a problem with an excess of individualism you know atomized the ill individualism you know atomized the ill Bicknell a few years ago was all about Bicknell a few years ago was all about they're all about how people are they're all about how people are becoming more separate from each other becoming more separate from each other and I think we could do by reminding and I think we could do by reminding ourselves you know that we don't have to ourselves you know that we don't have to sacrifice our individuality to become sacrifice our individuality to become more aware of our relation allottee and more aware of our relation allottee and the pursuit the pursuit the pursuit of individualism might be gone too far of individualism might be gone too far I'm gonna skip those slides they're not I'm gonna skip those slides they're not necessary important you see I've given necessary important you see I've given you those two examples once you kind of you those two examples once you kind of begin to sort of learn a little bit begin to sort of learn a little bit about non-western philosophies about non-western philosophies philosophies some other cultures you philosophies some other cultures you kind of I think he'd been to see all kind of I think he'd been to see all sorts of things in different ways this sorts of things in different ways this is the Alam bara in Granada she's a fat is the Alam bara in Granada she's a fat amazing building now what's one amazing building now what's one interesting thing about the Alam blaze interesting thing about the Alam blaze is not a religious building it's not a is not a religious building it's not a mosque it's a palace it's a complex of mosque it's a palace it's a complex of palaces but then actually you say I say palaces but then actually you say I say it's not a religious building there are it's not a religious building there are inscriptions from the Quran everywhere inscriptions from the Quran everywhere so and then look at this amazing so and then look at this amazing architecture what's going on well architecture what's going on well actually you know the architecture the actually you know the architecture the decoration it's reflecting and decoration it's reflecting and expressing ideas which you see expressing ideas which you see articulated in the philosophy of the articulated in the philosophy of the Islamic world but there are also ideas Islamic world but there are also ideas which are embedded in the culture though which are embedded in the culture though ideas in which there actually is no ideas in which there actually is no separation of secular and sacred you separation of secular and sacred you know the whole idea is it a religious know the whole idea is it a religious building is it a secular building it building is it a secular building it doesn't really apply because the sacred doesn't really apply because the sacred is everywhere and also this decoration is everywhere and also this decoration it's actually almost designed to give it's actually almost designed to give you that sense of awe and wonder that you that sense of awe and wonder that God the divine has a unity and a God the divine has a unity and a perfection but it's a unity and perfection but it's a unity and perfection which is beyond our perfection which is beyond our comprehension you look up to the top of comprehension you look up to the top of the building there and you could see the building there and you could see it's wonderful you can see it all fits it's wonderful you can see it all fits together you can't take it all in in one together you can't take it all in in one look there's kind of there's philosophy look there's kind of there's philosophy and theology even in the architecture and theology even in the architecture and this is a this is that just a sign and this is a this is that just a sign where had harmony for a housing where had harmony for a housing development in in true through just to development in in true through just to show how dominant harmony was this is show how dominant harmony was this is one of my favorite ones the Japanese one of my favorite ones the Japanese underground just to reinforce that point underground just to reinforce that point about pro-social nurse about pro-social nurse about it any masterpiece just becomes about it any masterpiece just becomes noise disturbance when emanating from noise disturbance when emanating from dear fans I think this is a wonderful dear fans I think this is a wonderful sign but what you'll notice is the sign sign but what you'll notice is the sign doesn't tell you to do anything it doesn't tell you to do anything it doesn't say keep your music quiet right doesn't say keep your music quiet right it's just reminding you that if your it's just reminding you that if your music comes out of your earphones music comes out of your earphones you are disturbing another person and I you are disturbing another person and I have to say that I didn't have that have to say that I didn't have that problem once in Japan it drives me crazy problem once in Japan it drives me crazy in Britain it really does and find the in Britain it really does and find the final one which is actually my favorite final one which is actually my favorite I haven't got time to go into this but I haven't got time to go into this but this is to do with this is apparently this is to do with this is apparently maybe someone here can prove this but maybe someone here can prove this but this is apparently an accurate this is apparently an accurate translation it's not one of those translation it's not one of those strange translations strange translations strange translations it's the loving service area and what I it's the loving service area and what I like about this is first of all again like about this is first of all again our stereotype of Confucian ethics is our stereotype of Confucian ethics is filial duty obedience to your parents filial duty obedience to your parents and I think this is a nice corrective and I think this is a nice corrective it's actually about the idea that it's it's actually about the idea that it's also about a family love there is that also about a family love there is that dimension there but also you think we dimension there but also you think we don't call it that we laugh we say this don't call it that we laugh we say this is funny loving service area so what do is funny loving service area so what do we call it the what I don't we call it the what I don't know what you call it in Dutch but we know what you call it in Dutch but we call it the baby changing area now if call it the baby changing area now if you think about that if you actually do you think about that if you actually do you know what we describe a lot of you know what we describe a lot of things in very very functional terms things in very very functional terms right right right our mindset has become kind of our mindset has become kind of mechanical scientific functional yeah mechanical scientific functional yeah that's that's interesting that's worth that's that's interesting that's worth thinking about thinking about thinking about I reckon okay just to conclude then why I reckon okay just to conclude then why take an interest in philosophies from take an interest in philosophies from other cultures well three reasons other cultures well three reasons first of all there is this wonderful first of all there is this wonderful story of the blind man and the elephant story of the blind man and the elephant which is actually originated in Buddhism which is actually originated in Buddhism but it is really taken on by the Jains but it is really taken on by the Jains in India the story is there's an in India the story is there's an elephant and the blind men are led out elephant and the blind men are led out to describe this elephant for the to describe this elephant for the benefit of the King and one feels the benefit of the King and one feels the Tusk and says this animal is a cold hard Tusk and says this animal is a cold hard animal one feels the tail and says this animal one feels the tail and says this is a is a is a soft and furry animal now I don't have soft and furry animal now I don't have to complete the story right because this to complete the story right because this when you start to tell the story you when you start to tell the story you immediately know the point of the story immediately know the point of the story in order to really understand what an in order to really understand what an elephant is you need to combine these elephant is you need to combine these different perspectives in the same way I different perspectives in the same way I think that what we get in different think that what we get in different parts of the world and at different parts of the world and at different parts of history are different angles on parts of history are different angles on the human experience and actually we the human experience and actually we build a greater more complete build a greater more complete understanding of the world by trying to understanding of the world by trying to take in as many of those perspectives as take in as many of those perspectives as possible putting them together like a a possible putting them together like a a cubist picture second thing which is cubist picture second thing which is useful is that actually what we've we useful is that actually what we've we often find that where we think there is often find that where we think there is a concept there are actually several so a concept there are actually several so it's a way of like making showing that it's a way of like making showing that how things are more complicated than we how things are more complicated than we might think so we think for example that might think so we think for example that the concept of the self the concept of the concept of the self is a concept about what makes the self is a concept about what makes the individual the individual there's the individual the individual there's another idea of the self which is what another idea of the self which is what makes the individual from a relational makes the individual from a relational point of view there are things about point of view there are things about free will for example as well we think free will for example as well we think there's a question of do we have free there's a question of do we have free will and when you look at other cultures will and when you look at other cultures you find that actually there are you find that actually there are different concepts of free will it's not different concepts of free will it's not like do we have this one thing so it like do we have this one thing so it helps you to kind of understand that helps you to kind of understand that where you thought there was only one where you thought there was only one thing there are many things and the thing there are many things and the third thing perhaps most importantly third thing perhaps most importantly this picture is a rather desperate this picture is a rather desperate metaphor we've got different different metaphor we've got different different railway lines we've got different roads railway lines we've got different roads you've also got birds this is meant to you've also got birds this is meant to represent different ways through life I represent different ways through life I don't I'm not a relativist right I don't don't I'm not a relativist right I don't think that anything goes I don't think think that anything goes I don't think that if we were to find a society today that if we were to find a society today which practiced slavery we would think which practiced slavery we would think oh that's interesting slavery is okay oh that's interesting slavery is okay because you know it's not like that because you know it's not like that but I think it is true that there's more but I think it is true that there's more than one way to lead a good life there than one way to lead a good life there are ways of living a bad life but are ways of living a bad life but there's more than one way to live a good there's more than one way to live a good life and there's more than one good way life and there's more than one good way to organize a society and different to organize a society and different philosophies have articulated different philosophies have articulated different visions of what it means to have a good visions of what it means to have a good life and to organize a good society and life and to organize a good society and by paying some attention to them we by paying some attention to them we might be able to open up ways of might be able to open up ways of thinking about that which might help us thinking about that which might help us to think a bit better at that point I to think a bit better at that point I think I will stop thank you think I will stop thank you thank you for your interesting talk it thank you for your interesting talk it was really nice to have it summarized was really nice to have it summarized again and it took me quite a few months again and it took me quite a few months to eat your book so I my first question to eat your book so I my first question is actually quite simple is actually quite simple you said a little bit about it but why you said a little bit about it but why did you are interested in did you why did you are interested in the topic and you said it needed to be the topic and you said it needed to be with yes but why well to be honest with with yes but why well to be honest with you I think my fundamental motivation is you I think my fundamental motivation is nothing more than interest right and I nothing more than interest right and I would if I would defend that I think would if I would defend that I think that particularly now again I don't know that particularly now again I don't know what the situation is like in the what the situation is like in the Netherlands but education now is so much Netherlands but education now is so much presented as you know a preparation for presented as you know a preparation for employment to make you contribute to the employment to make you contribute to the economy efficiently and to increase GDP economy efficiently and to increase GDP and this is kind of true in general and and this is kind of true in general and more educated society does all these more educated society does all these things but you know I have this what now things but you know I have this what now might seem a romantic view that there is might seem a romantic view that there is a value in intellectual pursuit for its a value in intellectual pursuit for its own sake and so therefore if something's own sake and so therefore if something's really interesting I want to find out really interesting I want to find out about it but I do have to earn a living about it but I do have to earn a living as well and I earn a living as a writer as well and I earn a living as a writer so there are lots of things that I find so there are lots of things that I find interesting that I can't pursue oh yeah interesting that I can't pursue oh yeah I have I have a big file of things that I have I have a big file of things that maybe maybe one day I'll do them you maybe maybe one day I'll do them you know maybe one day I do but this one the know maybe one day I do but this one the when I started thinking about it I when I started thinking about it I thought yeah this is actually important thought yeah this is actually important I don't like using the word important I don't like using the word important for things that I do because it seems for things that I do because it seems self-important I'm not saying that my self-important I'm not saying that my book is important but it is important book is important but it is important that people think about this that people think about this particularly at this time and again this particularly at this time and again this this is this is after the event at the this is this is after the event at the time I wasn't thinking about this I was time I wasn't thinking about this I was thinking about it just being interesting thinking about it just being interesting but while I was right again after over but while I was right again after over in there what a lot of people have said in there what a lot of people have said is you know there's a there's a there's is you know there's a there's a there's there's a need for this kind of thing there's a need for this kind of thing now more than ever because it seems that now more than ever because it seems that across the world across the world the age of openness is going into the age of openness is going into retreat people are putting up borders retreat people are putting up borders literal walls maybe in Mexico literal literal walls maybe in Mexico literal fences you know around the border of the fences you know around the border of the eurozone and the European Union but eurozone and the European Union but intellectual as well and I actually intellectual as well and I actually think the it is important that we sort think the it is important that we sort of recover some of that you know of recover some of that you know interest and curiosity and in a spirit interest and curiosity and in a spirit of wanting to understand of wanting to understand of other parts of the world we're being of other parts of the world we're being forced closer together by growing forced closer together by growing population and growing communications population and growing communications and when you when people are in very and when you when people are in very very close proximity if they don't very close proximity if they don't understand each other you're gonna get a understand each other you're gonna get a lot of friction and you can't completely lot of friction and you can't completely understand I mean I don't I don't understand I mean I don't I don't pretend that you read this book you pretend that you read this book you understand the world of course not but understand the world of course not but you begin to understand and in a way it you begin to understand and in a way it encourages the right attitude the an encourages the right attitude the an attitude of I don't understand you attitude of I don't understand you completely but I can see there's completely but I can see there's something interesting I can see things something interesting I can see things back that's the beginning of the the back that's the beginning of the the relation to the open relationship so it relation to the open relationship so it opens up the dialogue between us and opens up the dialogue between us and other cultures other philosophers yeah I other cultures other philosophers yeah I think it does open it opens dialogue and think it does open it opens dialogue and hopefully improves understanding and hopefully improves understanding and yeah in many ways dizzi the Islamic yeah in many ways dizzi the Islamic world is particularly interesting as world is particularly interesting as well because there have been lots of well because there have been lots of people who have said you know look you people who have said you know look you know there's no pasa the clash of know there's no pasa the clash of civilizations there has to be a clash of civilizations there has to be a clash of civilizations because Islamic values are civilizations because Islamic values are in complete contrast to Western ones and in complete contrast to Western ones and so forth well you know you don't have to so forth well you know you don't have to be a deep deep scholar of this to sort be a deep deep scholar of this to sort of see that's not right of see that's not right the Islamic Golden Age was a very open the Islamic Golden Age was a very open period on what you do need to understand period on what you do need to understand is that if there's going to be in in is that if there's going to be in in part of the world where certain more part of the world where certain more shall we say fundamentalist forms of shall we say fundamentalist forms of Islam have taken hold the way out of Islam have taken hold the way out of that is not a way into a western-style that is not a way into a western-style liberalism necessarily there are within liberalism necessarily there are within the Islamic tradition there are more the Islamic tradition there are more open ways of thinking but their Islamic open ways of thinking but their Islamic open ways of thinking they're not open ways of thinking they're not Western liberal ones and you know so Western liberal ones and you know so it's very important not to see things as it's very important not to see things as binary choices between Western values binary choices between Western values are a great and non Western values that are a great and non Western values that are not so we should do away with the are not so we should do away with the car keys everywhere yeah I mean is I car keys everywhere yeah I mean is I think that's right the dog you're right think that's right the dog you're right now the problem is like I said at the now the problem is like I said at the beginning I have to constantly be beginning I have to constantly be reinforcing the point the it's not about reinforcing the point the it's not about dichotomies because obviously you you dichotomies because obviously you you you you you have to talk you talk about you you you have to talk you talk about Western philosophy Chinese philosophy Western philosophy Chinese philosophy you're always using these general terms you're always using these general terms so there's the constant danger of you so there's the constant danger of you know thinking that everything is in neat know thinking that everything is in neat categories but what I try to do in the categories but what I try to do in the book but also what I'm talking about it book but also what I'm talking about it is keep going back to that point that is keep going back to that point that it's not about absolute differences it's it's not about absolute differences it's about foreground/background about foreground/background about foreground/background actually I have a metaphor I use at the actually I have a metaphor I use at the end which I do I think I think it kind end which I do I think I think it kind of works if you if you are recording of works if you if you are recording music for an album or something you have music for an album or something you have a mixing desk right so you record all a mixing desk right so you record all the instruments into a different channel the instruments into a different channel on the desk and to create the the final on the desk and to create the the final record you have to mix the sounds you record you have to mix the sounds you have to turn the volumes of the have to turn the volumes of the different instruments up and down to get different instruments up and down to get the right balance right so this is the the right balance right so this is the musical mixing desk now I think there's musical mixing desk now I think there's a kind of a philosophical mixing days a kind of a philosophical mixing days right so all over the world I think we right so all over the world I think we are dealing with the same are dealing with the same fundamental concepts you know so with fundamental concepts you know so with the self we have you know the atomistic the self we have you know the atomistic understanding you the the relational understanding you the the relational understanding we have freedom we have understanding we have freedom we have harmony all these things we all we've harmony all these things we all we've all got the same mixing desk but all got the same mixing desk but different cultures adjust the levels different cultures adjust the levels differently and so what happens is in differently and so what happens is in some cultures you you you you almost you some cultures you you you you almost you can't hear some of them because they're can't hear some of them because they're turned down so low and other things are turned down so low and other things are turned up so high but there they are all turned up so high but there they are all there so I think what I like about that there so I think what I like about that metaphor is that it kind of it's a way metaphor is that it kind of it's a way of understanding why there is very real of understanding why there is very real difference difference difference but why underneath it there is enough but why underneath it there is enough commonality that we can understand each commonality that we can understand each other and it's not about fundamental other and it's not about fundamental binary opposite divisions so if we stay binary opposite divisions so if we stay in that metaphor and we can we can turn in that metaphor and we can we can turn up all the buttons right right yeah so up all the buttons right right yeah so there has to be a choice yes somewhere there has to be a choice yes somewhere yeah how do you make the choice yeah yeah how do you make the choice yeah yeah no that's true you can't say make yeah no that's true you can't say make if in the musical thing if you turn up if in the musical thing if you turn up all the instruments to ten it won't work all the instruments to ten it won't work because you know the bass might just be because you know the bass might just be too dominant or whatever it might be the too dominant or whatever it might be the metaphor isn't quite perfect but you metaphor isn't quite perfect but you know it's like if you think about the know it's like if you think about the values of community and values around values of community and values around individuality I mean it seems very clear individuality I mean it seems very clear that there is always a balance to be had that there is always a balance to be had there if if you if you have a society in there if if you if you have a society in which individual rights and individual which individual rights and individual liberty and freedom is very very high it liberty and freedom is very very high it tends to decrease community cohesion tends to decrease community cohesion right communities tend to be stronger right communities tend to be stronger where there is more pressure for where there is more pressure for uniformity this is a yeah this is a uniformity this is a yeah this is a commonly observed thing how do you commonly observed thing how do you decide how to get the balance right I decide how to get the balance right I I'm a bit of a I'm a skeptic about how I'm a bit of a I'm a skeptic about how can I say abstracting universal theories can I say abstracting universal theories there's a very good book by Marti ascend there's a very good book by Marti ascend called the ideal of the idea of justice called the ideal of the idea of justice it's a very very good book and he makes it's a very very good book and he makes the point that the paradigm really in the point that the paradigm really in Western philosophy another Western philosophy another generalization come to that a minute generalization come to that a minute since Plato says Plato really we what we since Plato says Plato really we what we do is we ask what is justice or we ask do is we ask what is justice or we ask what is the ideal Society what is the ideal Society we construct a theoretical ideal and we construct a theoretical ideal and then we try and get as close to it as then we try and get as close to it as possible possible possible right Sen says that's that's just wrong right Sen says that's that's just wrong I mean for a start we that's just wrong I mean for a start we are never going to agree on what this are never going to agree on what this ideal is but secondly that's not the ideal is but secondly that's not the best way to improve a society without best way to improve a society without having an idea of the perfect society having an idea of the perfect society you can usually see what's wrong and you can usually see what's wrong and what needs fixing so it's much better to what needs fixing so it's much better to work on adjusting the real world than work on adjusting the real world than trying to get the real world to meet an trying to get the real world to meet an ideal so there is no sort of like um ideal so there is no sort of like um there is no single answer to that there is no single answer to that question of how do you set the balance question of how do you set the balance you have to be constantly experimenting you have to be constantly experimenting and tinkering you have to see what's too and tinkering you have to see what's too loud at the moment and what's too quiet loud at the moment and what's too quiet and adjust and in a way you know society and adjust and in a way you know society is a constant experiment you sometimes is a constant experiment you sometimes you think you're going to fix it by you think you're going to fix it by boosting I don't know whatever it might boosting I don't know whatever it might be be be relationality or saying you might find relationality or saying you might find that has an unforeseen effect it's it's that has an unforeseen effect it's it's messy trial and error which is not messy trial and error which is not something philosophers are keen on something philosophers are keen on unless you're this your David Hume who I unless you're this your David Hume who I thoroughly recommend I do too I am thoroughly recommend I do too I am raised born and raised in Western raised born and raised in Western society so I think in a quite society so I think in a quite individualistic way I also think we have individualistic way I also think we have an axis of individuality in our society an axis of individuality in our society so how as an individual do I embrace or so how as an individual do I embrace or incorporate those other perspectives in incorporate those other perspectives in my life yeah my life yeah I've got 30 years of biases and I've got 30 years of biases and education in Western society yeah well I education in Western society yeah well I mean the first thing is actually to mean the first thing is actually to accept the fact that we are the products accept the fact that we are the products of our societies I think that we have of our societies I think that we have such a belief in autonomy and choice and such a belief in autonomy and choice and freedom that we don't like to freedom that we don't like to acknowledge how much we are you know the acknowledge how much we are you know the products of forces that we did not products of forces that we did not choose right this is the great irony choose right this is the great irony named this great free individual but I named this great free individual but I didn't choose to be like this I was didn't choose to be like this I was brought up in an individualistic culture brought up in an individualistic culture and therefore I become individualistic and therefore I become individualistic so you I think you kind of acknowledge so you I think you kind of acknowledge the fact that your own autonomy and the fact that your own autonomy and freedom has been molded right so it's freedom has been molded right so it's not as absolute as you think not as absolute as you think and then I think it's also saying that and then I think it's also saying that is the way we are that's the way our is the way we are that's the way our society is and you know you you have to society is and you know you you have to work with what you have right there's no work with what you have right there's no point in kind of imagining that we could point in kind of imagining that we could tear everything up and create the tear everything up and create the perfect balance tomorrow so again I perfect balance tomorrow so again I think it's really the same answer as to think it's really the same answer as to the previous question as an individual the previous question as an individual you can only use your increased you can only use your increased awareness of how you are the problems awareness of how you are the problems with how you are and the resources with how you are and the resources suggested by other cultures to try to suggested by other cultures to try to just you know push yourself in the just you know push yourself in the direction you think you need to be direction you think you need to be pushed in and I think for me because pushed in and I think for me because again I'm a very individual thing I'm a again I'm a very individual thing I'm a very individualistic person it's not the very individualistic person it's not the same as selfish by the same it's not the same as selfish by the way individualistic is not necessarily way individualistic is not necessarily selfish I think I am very selfish I think I am very individualistic I I really don't like individualistic I I really don't like group things at all I don't like music group things at all I don't like music festivals because I hate being in a festivals because I hate being in a crowd yeah crowd yeah crowd yeah which is exactly what most people like which is exactly what most people like about them oh it's so lovely everyone's about them oh it's so lovely everyone's loving this together no I don't like loving this together no I don't like that I think I think I think Nuremberg that I think I think I think Nuremberg run away I think yeah I need to work on run away I think yeah I need to work on I I can work I can never let's work on I I can work I can never let's work on being more attentive and sensitive to being more attentive and sensitive to those relational aspects I have with those relational aspects I have with people and to sort of and and and people and to sort of and and and develop them and I think I think that develop them and I think I think that you know you don't transform yourself you know you don't transform yourself but you you had you adapt and change a but you you had you adapt and change a little bit and I think the experience of little bit and I think the experience of writing this book has has changed me writing this book has has changed me without transforming me if I may use without transforming me if I may use that distinction I think I had a similar that distinction I think I had a similar experience reading your book I kept experience reading your book I kept finding myself wanting to defend Western finding myself wanting to defend Western philosophy so you were just talking philosophy so you were just talking about the relational self and I about the relational self and I immediately thought well what about now immediately thought well what about now itself TV that's the TV that you are in itself TV that's the TV that you are in a context in a narrative with other a context in a narrative with other people that's also quite a dominant people that's also quite a dominant theory and it's relational the narrative theory and it's relational the narrative self self self yeah Dennett but why do I want to defend yeah Dennett but why do I want to defend Western philosophy because Western philosophy because intellectually I agree with you intellectually I agree with you different perspectives that's a good different perspectives that's a good thing but my knee-jerk reaction is but thing but my knee-jerk reaction is but we have good things too yeah yeah yeah we have good things too yeah yeah yeah but I agree we have good things too I but I agree we have good things too I didn't want this to turn into a you know didn't want this to turn into a you know let's kick my parents kind of thing you let's kick my parents kind of thing you know I I'm the product I think in know I I'm the product I think in Western philosophy has huge resources Western philosophy has huge resources and although this book is broadened in and although this book is broadened in my mind I still am rooted in that my mind I still am rooted in that tradition and I think that's okay now tradition and I think that's okay now this is actually interesting in itself this is actually interesting in itself because I think a lot of non-western because I think a lot of non-western philosophies are better at explaining philosophies are better at explaining why that's okay because actually this why that's okay because actually this the self image of Western philosophy is the self image of Western philosophy is it's not about a tradition at all it's it's not about a tradition at all it's not not not about belonging to a tradition it's about belonging to a tradition it's about following the argument where it about following the argument where it leads it's about using reason and so we leads it's about using reason and so we kind of imagine that when we do kind of imagine that when we do philosophy we're not doing something philosophy we're not doing something which belongs in a particular culture which belongs in a particular culture and has a particular tradition I think and has a particular tradition I think in in other philosophies there's more of in in other philosophies there's more of an acknowledgement that this is a an acknowledgement that this is a tradition of four and if you are brought tradition of four and if you are brought up in it you have a certain affinity up in it you have a certain affinity with it you have a certain almost with it you have a certain almost loyalty to it if you like which is you loyalty to it if you like which is you know it's not objective it is part where know it's not objective it is part where you're from and um there's a very nice you're from and um there's a very nice sentence in the book from Ghandi more or sentence in the book from Ghandi more or less and he talks about this need for a less and he talks about this need for a kind of balance he says you know he kind of balance he says you know he wants to live in a home where you know wants to live in a home where you know the windows are open and the doors are the windows are open and the doors are open where you know he can have these open where you know he can have these interactions with other cultures but he interactions with other cultures but he doesn't want to be in a situation where doesn't want to be in a situation where by you know things are so open that his by you know things are so open that his own tradition is is blown away and I own tradition is is blown away and I think that's that's the important think that's that's the important balance to sort of again that we balance to sort of again that we acknowledge we are the products of our acknowledge we are the products of our traditions is perfectly okay and good to traditions is perfectly okay and good to feel a certain loyalty but that loyalty feel a certain loyalty but that loyalty shouldn't be a blind loyalty it shouldn't be a blind loyalty it shouldn't be a loyalty which closes your shouldn't be a loyalty which closes your minds to other people it's a bit like minds to other people it's a bit like the difference between benign patriotism the difference between benign patriotism and malign nationalism yeah the right and malign nationalism yeah the right kind of patriotism is I'm from this kind of patriotism is I'm from this country or I have become a member of country or I have become a member of this country you know and I feel a this country you know and I feel a belonging to it I feel a special belonging to it I feel a special attachment I feel a special affection attachment I feel a special affection I'm going to feel more pleased when the I'm going to feel more pleased when the Netherlands beats England in the World Netherlands beats England in the World Cup of football than I am when you know Cup of football than I am when you know Wales beats hungry or something but that Wales beats hungry or something but that doesn't mean I think my country is right doesn't mean I think my country is right always I've got nothing to learn from always I've got nothing to learn from other cultures and I'm not going to other cultures and I'm not going to respect other cultures you know so respect other cultures you know so looking at the time looking at the time I'm going to ask him one last question I'm going to ask him one last question yep it spoke very clearly in your book yep it spoke very clearly in your book that you are not an armchair philosopher that you are not an armchair philosopher I said that's somebody who just thinks I said that's somebody who just thinks and doesn't go out into the real world and doesn't go out into the real world you have actually traveled the world you have actually traveled the world with we live in a globalized world with we live in a globalized world nowadays and I think one of the main nowadays and I think one of the main challenges of our time is climate change challenges of our time is climate change so for somebody who doesn't want to fly so for somebody who doesn't want to fly for example doesn't really have time to for example doesn't really have time to travel the world by other means because travel the world by other means because it takes more time what should we do it takes more time what should we do when we don't have the opportunity or we when we don't have the opportunity or we choose not to take the opportunity to choose not to take the opportunity to visit other cause yeah yeah visit other cause yeah yeah it's a good question I mean obviously it's a good question I mean obviously now what was this there's a word for now what was this there's a word for which is like a flight guilt or which is like a flight guilt or something about yes which I do have a something about yes which I do have a new probably thing I should have it if new probably thing I should have it if you're making the choice not to fly you you're making the choice not to fly you probably think I see through it I do I probably think I see through it I do I kind of I think climate change is very kind of I think climate change is very important I do agree with you I think important I do agree with you I think the solutions have to come from policy the solutions have to come from policy and government I think as citizens we and government I think as citizens we can make statements and we cannot happy can make statements and we cannot happy we can not be wasteful I have taken the we can not be wasteful I have taken the decision to fly and you may I might be decision to fly and you may I might be criticized for that I understand that it criticized for that I understand that it wasn't men as in it would
