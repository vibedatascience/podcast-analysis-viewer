## 1. The Three-Generation Journey to Musical Freedom

***"My maternal grandmother was quite an extraordinary lady who established for me that the presence of the arts in your life are really going to be enriching and that there's no way one should break that involvement."***

The arc of three generations of women in Shubha Mudgal's family represents a profound journey of female empowerment through music. Her maternal grandmother, born in 1900, studied mathematics to MSC level and worked as chief inspector of schools—extraordinary achievements for a woman of that era. Despite being disowned by her family for her choice of marriage and widowed early when Mudgal's mother was just ten, she maintained an unwavering commitment to education and the arts. She wanted to learn Hindustani classical music but never got the opportunity, yet she ensured her daughters received musical training.

This grandmother's influence extended far beyond music. She established a preparatory school in Allahabad where she pioneered inclusive education decades before it became fashionable. In one remarkable instance, she welcomed a young man with motor difficulties into her classroom of small children. By giving him art supplies and allowing him to showcase his drawing talents, she transformed him into a hero for the other children. Within a couple of years, this young man was working as a commercial artist. This happened over fifty years ago, demonstrating her progressive understanding of education's transformative power without any formal expertise in special education.

Mudgal's mother, though trained in Hindustani classical music, pursued it only as a hobby while becoming a noted academic in English literature. She possessed a lovely voice and could compose, but never performed publicly. The mother's role proved crucial in the final generation's breakthrough—she gave Mudgal the unprecedented offer to take a year off after graduation to decide whether to commit fully to music. This was extraordinary for the early 1980s, especially from parents who had always emphasized academics. The mother's reasoning was practical yet profound: why should Mudgal do exactly what everyone else does when music clearly brought her the most passion and joy?

The progression reveals the systematic barriers women faced in pursuing artistic careers. The grandmother's generation couldn't even access learning; the mother's generation could learn but not professionalize; only in Mudgal's generation did full professional commitment become possible. Yet even then, the path wasn't smooth—Mudgal faced constant questioning about "betraying" classical music when she sang popular songs, criticism no male artist would face with such intensity. The family's support proved essential, but so did changing social conditions that finally allowed a woman to claim music as her livelihood rather than merely an accomplishment.

## 2. The Transformative Power of Enforced Solitude

***"Left alone, I had no other option but to just move towards the music and find a kind of deep companionship with music which perhaps I wouldn't even have sought otherwise."***

The breakdown of Mudgal's first marriage, though traumatic, became a crucial period of musical development. After her eight-year marriage to the son of her guru Pandit Vinayak Chandra Maudgalya ended, she found herself displaced in Delhi with minimal resources. Finding accommodation proved difficult—landlords would ask for company leases she couldn't provide, and when she mentioned being a singer, suspicion would break out on their faces. She finally settled in a small apartment in Paharganj that initially had no water connection, a disconnected electricity supply, and a massive cobweb with a dead pigeon in it—something from a Hitchcock movie, as she describes it.

During this period of isolation, with no concerts to perform and no assignments, Mudgal had nothing but the vast repertoire she had learned from her gurus. Her family, disapproving of her decision to leave the marriage, offered no refuge. This enforced solitude became her crucible. She spent extensive time with her voice, working on how she wanted to sound and how to present compositions and ragas. She questioned whether she needed to follow the same format or template for each raga in each composition, recognizing that ragas have personalities that shouldn't be templatized.

The isolation allowed her to work without the constant intervention of a guru. In traditional taleem sessions, the moment a student makes a mistake, the guru steps in to show the way—you're never really on your own. But during this period, Mudgal had to rely entirely on what she had learned and her own hearing of herself. She had to make well-considered but spontaneous choices about using the blocks of musical phrases that characterize a raga. She had to save herself, as in a chess game, when she felt in danger musically. Nobody was there to tell her if her voice sounded too broad at a particular point or if her modulation in tumri was appropriate.

This period taught her to use her taleem independently rather than in the chaperoned, guided way she had been privileged to experience earlier. The musical choices she made during this time—choices others might disagree with—became fundamental to her artistic identity. The companionship of music and the belief that this was how she wanted to live her life gave her strength through emotional turmoil. It was during these years that she truly found her own voice, not just technically but artistically and personally. The breath of life entered her music during this period of isolation and struggle.

## 3. The Guru-Shishya Tradition: Beauty and Brutality

***"The moment the teacher wants to be put on a pedestal and the music becomes secondary, that position that we get from students is because we are transmitting a certain sila of music to them. Our importance is because of the music."***

The guru-shishya parampara in Hindustani classical music represents both an extraordinarily effective pedagogical system and a deeply problematic power structure. Mudgal's experience reveals both dimensions. Her father would wake her at 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning, and they would ride on his scooter to Pandit Ramashreya Jha's home for taleem. If two or three senior students were already present, Mudgal would not be taught that day—she would simply sit and listen, sometimes for the entire session. This wasn't easy for someone not from a hereditary musician's family, where such patience and obedience might come more naturally.

The criticism could be brutal and public. When Mudgal got "slammed and bashed" in front of everyone, it was in very uncertain and brutal terms. She would return home complaining to her father that she couldn't take it anymore. His response was pragmatic: it was her decision whether to continue, but if she wasn't prepared for what the guru asked, she had no right to complain about his unkindness—she deserved it. This harsh approach, while difficult, taught discipline and forced serious engagement with the material. The privilege of sitting in on others' taleem sessions proved invaluable—Mudgal picked up numerous compositions and learned about voice training, posture, and interaction with accompanying artists simply by observing.

However, the tradition's darker aspects demand examination. The completely skewed power balance can be exploitative in both directions—gurus can exploit students, but entitled students can also take advantage. The expectation of unquestioning obedience becomes dangerous when questions are blocked. Mudgal witnessed rituals like gurus getting their feet washed in a patra by students during Guru Purnima celebrations—practices that continue today despite their questionable relevance. The demand for "tan, man, dhan" (body, mind, wealth) surrender creates vulnerability that can destroy lives if not handled carefully.

The tradition needs auditing and review, Mudgal argues, despite the criticism this stance will generate. The system contains amazing teaching methods and transmits not just music but the ethos in which music is made, lessons about changing times and adaptability. But when teachers become more concerned with being powerful godmen or godwomen than with the music itself, the system fails. As a teacher herself, Mudgal refuses to demand unquestioning obedience. She tells students she may not have answers to their questions and acknowledges her own ignorance in many areas. The vulnerability of students must be handled with care, and humiliation—even if deserved for poor preparation—can be delivered without cruelty. The manner of correction matters as much as the correction itself.

## 4. Learning from Multiple Gurus and Diverse Influences

***"My guru told someone who asked how many gurus he had learned from: 'Pachattar'—seventy-five. What he was alluding to was the fact that he took from many sources, then analyzed what was happening and created his own musical statement."***

Mudgal's musical education defied the orthodox notion of single-guru loyalty that some claim defines the tradition. Her first formal training began with Shrimati Kamala Bai, a student of Pandit Ramashreya Jha, at St. Mary's Convent in Allahabad. When Mudgal's father initially said she couldn't join the music class because she was a "grownup girl" who hadn't studied Hindustani music and it was too late, Sister Eugenia negotiated a one-month trial. Kamala Bai soon recommended that Mudgal study directly with her guru, leading to years of intensive training with Pandit Ramashreya Jha.

Ramashreya Jha shaped Mudgal's musical foundation fundamentally. He gave her confidence to sing with the voice she was born with—a powerful, somewhat androgynous, husky voice rather than the "clear bell-like high-pitched" voice considered quintessentially feminine in Indian classical music. Mudgal spent considerable time trying to sound "sweet and honeyed," but it never worked—she always sounded like herself trying to imitate someone else. Jha equipped her with the basic approach to Hindustani classical music suited to her natural voice. He taught seemingly simple but crucial skills like tuning a tanpura, which serves as ear training and fine-tunes one's hearing. His teaching was rigorous and sometimes harsh, but it built the foundation for everything that followed.

When Mudgal moved to Delhi at her mother's insistence—to escape the indulgent environment where everyone treated her like the little kid they'd known for twenty years—she studied with Pandit Vinayak Chandra Maudgalya at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. Maudgalya, whom everyone called Bhai, possessed an extraordinary ability to inspire confidence in students. Unlike intimidating gurus, he would convince Mudgal she could accomplish what she doubted—like learning a new composition in a week for an All India Radio recording. His deep belief in his students made them achieve things they didn't think possible. Despite working grueling 12-14 hour days running the vidyalaya, he would teach Mudgal late at night if she wanted to learn something like Shuddh Sarang.

Most remarkably, when Mudgal expressed interest in tumri—a form Maudgalya neither sang nor particularly liked—he took her to Naina Devi in Karol Bagh and asked Devi to teach her. This generosity of sending a student to another artist, a specialist in an area outside one's own expertise, exemplifies the tradition at its best. Naina Devi proved indulgent and loving, inviting Mudgal to birthday celebrations at her home and teaching her about which musical forms suit which seasons. Devi's deep concern for artist welfare—helping many artists get subsidized housing, identifying doctors, even having artists stay at her home during surgery recovery—demonstrated that community care was integral to the musical tradition.

Mudgal also learned from Pandit Vasant Acharekar, though not for an extended period. His teaching style included humor and permitted disagreement—unusual in the guru-shishya tradition. He insisted Mudgal not call him guru but "Guruji" or just address him directly, saying he was merely sharing what he knew. These conversations and debates, where he gave her independence and freedom to disagree, proved valuable even though their time together was cut short by his illness and death. The diversity of approaches, temperaments, and specializations among her gurus gave Mudgal a breadth of understanding impossible with a single teacher, however accomplished.

## 5. The Transition to Popular Music in the 1990s

***"I had no idea of what was happening in production and post-production. One day Javahar invited me to his office and right behind him on the shelf were these cassettes saying 'Ali More Angana, Shubha Mudgal.' I didn't even know it was launched."***

When Javahar Wattal approached Mudgal to record popular music, she was hesitant, facing fear of the unfamiliar and uncertainty about whether she could handle it. After several months of discussion, she proposed recording one song to see if both parties wanted to continue. Wattal was generous, setting up the recording to be comfortable for her and allowing unlimited time. The title track "Ali More Angana" was recorded at Ravi Pawar's studio in Okhla. The experience proved challenging because Mudgal's entire musical world had been live concerts and recording in live situations where tanpura, tabla, and voice occupied the same space with minimal separation.

Multitrack dubbing—being the sole person in an isolated booth, singing and hearing everything through headphones—was profoundly disorienting. It was like having cameras embedded inside your eyes, zooming in and out in your own way. The experienced audio engineer Mr. Chawla and the team showed patience as Mudgal adjusted to this alien environment. After recording the title track, Wattal played it to others and returned "grinning from ear to ear," saying they should do a full album. Four or five songs were Mudgal's own compositions, with two written by her as well. She never realized what this would mean—she thought of it simply as doing something outside her studied genre, like singing "Happy Birthday" at parties.

The aftermath brought unexpected complications. Mudgal discovered the album had launched only when she saw cassettes on Wattal's office shelf. The cover featured an unfortunate sketch of a woman in a yellow kurta with flowing chunni, hands raised in supposed bliss but looking more like she was hanging clothes to dry. The company positioned the album as "our answer to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan," flooding Mudgal with interview requests. She constantly protested this comparison—Nusrat represented a completely different style and stature. But the positioning triggered a question that has never left her: how could she abandon and betray classical music for money and fame?

This accusation came from people to whom fame and money both mattered, creating a bitter irony. Mudgal would defend herself until one day she simply said, "I have not abandoned classical music." The shocked silence that followed made her feel like she had suddenly grown horns. The criticism continued despite her having sung only one album with hired session musicians she'd never met and didn't know. When one song topped the charts and concert invitations arrived, she faced a practical problem—she had only six or seven songs and no band to perform them with. Between "Ali More Angana" in 1996 and "Ab Ke Sawan" in 1999, she lived her regular life of Hindustani classical music, yet the accusations of polluting the environment and succumbing to quick fame persisted.

## 6. The Recording Experience and Vocal Technique

***"The microphone is an amazing teacher for voice. When you put those headphones on and you start listening to yourself as you dub a song, the many grains, the many textures, the many hiccups that you would never have accepted earlier, they are amplified and brought to your notice."***

Recording technology taught Mudgal aspects of her voice she had never encountered in live performance. In Hindustani classical music, the training focuses on elaborating seed musical ideas—taking a set of notes and giving them variation, different twists, never singing a line the same way twice. But in popular music, she had to sing somebody else's composition exactly as they wanted it, unless working with someone like Shantanu Moitra who gave singers freedom within his song structure. Moving away from constant variation proved quite difficult initially.

The microphone revealed details invisible in live performance. When Mudgal's son Dhaval attended a recording session, he pointed out that her "ja" sound came across as "cha" on the mic. She was right—Mudgal hadn't been listening carefully enough through the headphones and thought her enunciation was accurate. She learned that certain practices acceptable in classical music—like extending a syllable or even a consonant—don't work in popular music. Saying "jab" and extending it to "jabber" is taboo in popular music, though not in classical. These technical lessons improved her vocal technique across all forms.

The experience of recording for dance productions and various albums taught her about expression in new ways. Terms like "peppy" or "melancholy" had no single definition—what kind of peppiness or melancholy did the composer want? Mudgal had to find ways to understand and deliver what was requested while ensuring her own perspective on emotions found its way into the songs. Fortunately, she usually received freedom to interpret rather than being forced to memorize even the expressive elements and deliver them mechanically. Learning to use her voice with different approaches—broad brush strokes versus ornate, lacy work—became part of her expanded toolkit.

The recording process also taught her about using silence deliberately, inserting pauses long enough for listeners to recognize them as intentional rather than accidental. These lessons in communication through recorded media complemented her live performance skills. While she acknowledges doing some "very silly jingles for the princely sum of 500 rupees" and one or two songs she wishes she hadn't done, the overall experience of recording popular music enriched her understanding of vocal technique, expression, and the craft of music-making across genres. The discipline of popular music, with its different orientation and challenges, never made her feel imprisoned or apologetic about singing those songs.

## 7. The Exploitative Business of Music in India

***"Every organization asks me to send pictures. I try and send them pictures which I have permission to use and which are recent so that I should look like the person who will appear on stage. Suddenly I'll see myself at 21 in a poster for a program."***

The music industry's treatment of artists reveals systematic exploitation and unprofessionalism. When Mudgal recorded her first classical album in Delhi around 1985-86, a small company recording classical music called her months after recording to sign a contract. They found it surprising that she wanted to read it first. The contract was totally skewed against the artist with unnecessary clauses, but she was bullied into signing. Nothing has changed fundamentally since then. Today there are no commissioned recordings of classical music at all. Artists must record themselves, pay for the launch, and get vinyl made. Labels might put their stamp on it if the artist knows the right person or is hugely well-known, offering at best a few add-on goodies.

Labels that specialized in classical music 20-25 years ago now only sell their catalog repertoire on digital platforms. No new commissioned recordings happen for any youngster, however talented. Mudgal worked as a consultant for two or three fairly big labels on their classical music catalogs and found very few people thinking creatively about presenting the repertoire. The simple approach was getting the best-known people, paying them enough money, making them record, and putting it out. But vast amounts of repertoire are being lost because nobody records or documents it. She suggested catching artists young, establishing relationships with those who would become big in the future, doing their debut albums well. Of the 8-10 artists she recommended, at least four are very big names today, but labels didn't follow through.

The A&R (Artists and Repertoire) part of the industry consists of either stone cold walls or people not bothered about the music. Artists must think of different ways of presenting music, but radio—which played such a huge role outside India in shaping bands and careers—has never provided such opportunities in India. When Mudgal wanted to understand why her ideas were rejected, she met with marketing people who explained they went to Lajpat Rai Market and asked cassette dealers. When dealers said they hadn't heard of an artist, marketing concluded it wouldn't sell. But how would dealers specializing in Punjabi pop know about a wise scholar musician with treasures from a particular gharana? Niche labels and brands have proliferated worldwide with huge success stories, and the niche in India would be mega-sized compared to other countries, yet nobody bothers.

Payment issues plague artists constantly. Getting paid too little happens only if you agree, but not getting paid on time is universal. Artists are forced to make multiple requests to retrieve their own money and are humiliated for it. People will meet Mudgal ten years later and say, "Do you remember you sang for so-and-so event? Of course, at that time you were not so well-known"—a reminder of supposed inferior status. The issue of artists' rights, copyrights, and intellectual property represents a nightmare for which general students of Hindustani music are totally unprepared. Mudgal would compose for dance or sing for dance with no letters or agreements exchanged. When contracts finally came, they arrived 10 days to one month after recording was complete, often after performances had taken place.

## 8. Digital Platforms' Failure to Accommodate Indian Music

***"When I add my music and say who are my co-artists, I do not have the options in the drop-down menus to say tabla, sarangi, sitar, surbahar, tanpura. I can only choose drums, percussion, keyboards. You are in India, you have an office in India, you say the Indian music market is robust, but you don't have anything for the Indian artist."***

The digital music revolution has largely bypassed Indian classical music in terms of proper infrastructure and recognition. Every major online digital platform is available in India with fancy offices and well-trained staff. They hold conferences about music at seven-star luxury venues. Yet not even 1% of traditional musicians are involved in these conferences—it's as if they don't exist. When artists want to upload music on digital platforms like Spotify, they go through aggregators, registering as members and uploading music with metadata that gets sent to multiple platforms. But the system fundamentally fails to accommodate Indian music.

The drop-down menus for listing co-artists don't include options for tabla, sarangi, sitar, surbahar, or tanpura—only drums, percussion, and keyboards. Tabla is popular across the world and across forms, yet these platforms operating in India with offices in India don't provide for it. They have specific detailed drop-down options for African music and Latino music but nothing for Indian music. If an artist wants to register a new composition in a raga, there's no option to register it as a khayal. The platforms provide options for oboe and every Western instrument, but Indian instruments aren't considered worth including—it's not rocket science to add them.

This represents a fundamental failure to consider Indian music as part of the Indian music industry. The platforms are providing opportunities for everything except anything from India. Mudgal doesn't mean to be rapidly nationalistic about it—she simply wants proper registration of Indian instruments and forms. The fancy offices and conferences serve no purpose if they can't accommodate the music of the country they operate in. The situation reveals how the mainstream music industry has crumpled, catering only to the lowest common denominator and the most popular mainstream content while submerging all the niches and genres where good work happens.

The problem extends beyond just technical infrastructure. Big companies get incredibly ossified and think in clichéd ways. Multinationals coming to India in the 1990s arrived with the impression that India is two things: Bollywood and cricket. Everything had to have a Bollywood or cricket marketing angle. These companies, once they get beyond a certain size, fill with mediocrity. People in India at Amazon Music, Spotify, Netflix, and similar platforms are completely clueless, with no imagination and no sense of what the market really is. They play to clichés about what gets the most numbers, not caring about anything else.

The market should work in the opposite direction—catering to every individual consumer and putting every individual artist or creator out there. That's the beauty of what markets can do. But these platforms aren't doing that. They maintain the dictatorship of the majority, catering to the most crass tastes that are also most shallowly held, so they don't even generate substantial revenues. Meanwhile, they submerge all the niches where deeply committed audiences exist—audiences that love rather than merely like, audiences willing to pay for what they value. The failure represents both a business mistake and a cultural tragedy.

## 9. The Importance of Arts Education in Schools

***"Creating material that would help people access the music at their own time when they have the time to do so—that is one thing. I also feel that music and arts cannot remain a hobby item in the school curriculum because they will never be taken seriously."***

Mudgal participated in discussions at NCERT in 2005 about including arts education, and recommendations were accepted, going up to the Central Advisory Board of Education where she was also a member. But proper implementation never happened. Today, if someone wants resource material—books, jigsaw puzzles, games to teach children about music without increasing their school bag load—there is no material or very little material available. This was pointed out in 2005, emphasizing that creating such material requires a huge exercise that no individual can undertake. Creating material for teaching music—not to perform but to enjoy and have informed opinions—needs work in many ways, but it hasn't happened.

The tragic situation extends to basic resources. Mudgal cannot find a good poster of leading artists. Some stamps have been issued, but finding those stamps is nearly impossible. At various centenaries, coins were issued in artists' memory, but Mudgal has never been able to get them. Where is she supposed to go—traipsing off to RBI every few days to find out if a coin is available? Why isn't it easily accessible? Creating material that helps people access music at their own time, when they have time to do so, is essential. The engagement with arts made possible for every child in the country is urgent, not just essential.

Music and arts cannot remain hobby items in the school curriculum because they will never be taken seriously that way. While Mudgal doesn't like a competitive scene, it's impossible to make everyone deal seriously with arts education programs without actually evaluating them. Evaluation methods must not depend merely on performance. For too long, only the child with the good voice is considered a good singer, only the child who can dance well is considered talented. But audiences need to be created—who will people sing to, dance to? Creating those audiences and showing that audiences are important, that ancillary professions are important, must be part of education.

Recognition of craftspeople is virtually absent. Have you ever seen anyone say they're using a tanpura made by the Mirajekars of Miraj? Occasionally there are awards for master craftsmen, but by and large, nothing exists like this. Until respect is given to each of these people, they won't continue these professions. There's already a problem. If entrepreneurs are listening, this represents an opportunity—the audience for Hindustani classical music may seem relatively small but in absolute numbers is fairly large because it's dispersed and committed. These people love the music, not just like it. They will be willing to pay. Publishers should immediately commission listening guides. YouTube channels and other ventures could popularize the music. There's definitely a market, but it requires will and imagination to serve it properly.

## 10. Teaching Music and Responsibility Toward Students

***"I always tell students that please ask me the questions, but I am asking you for the questions with the caveat that I may not have the answers to many and I don't know if I'll ever have the answers. So be prepared for me to confess my ignorance in many matters."***

Teaching music, like becoming a parent, is something you're never prepared for. You hope to teach students at least something that will help them in life. A certain amount of freedom must be given—Mudgal doesn't want to force students to follow her, doesn't want to create people trying to sound like her or use her mannerisms or gestures. If she can help them forge a deep love for music, which they already come with but may have moments of doubt about, and help them stay anchored, that's wonderful. But the learning for the teacher is humongous and continuing.

Sitting across a student who trusts you with their voice, telling them to try projecting differently, and watching that change is amazing. But when a student says they're not sure a suggestion works, Mudgal always wonders why—because they're hearing something else she's not hearing. It's a good exercise in checking what will really work for somebody else, giving them options and freedom to discard suggestions. Not every suggestion will be accepted by a student, nor should it be. Many students who come to Mudgal have learned from other gurus. Either their gurus sent them to learn tumri specifically, or they moved locations and their guru suggested talking to Shubha. They come with much they've already learned. Does she really need to erase everything to begin teaching them?

Technique can be taught—Mudgal can explain that a student will sound better singing or projecting in a particular way. But actually doing it requires the student's own work; she can't help with that. The constant research in her head involves figuring out how to help students reach the point where they can express themselves authentically. She doesn't have all the answers but keeps trying—explaining using metaphors from other disciplines, making them listen to other artists singing. Sometimes experiments work, sometimes there's self-doubt. Their breath of life can only come from them and their journey. There's only so much a teacher can do.

The responsibility extends beyond technique to ethics and values. Mudgal tries to give students a sense of the immense diversity in every aspect of Indian life. Other than your own preferred form of music, other forms are worth listening to, discussing, and learning about before rejecting them or passing judgment. This idea of respecting diversity—not just in music but in life—proves truly valuable. Students need to understand that the power of music creates effects, not just one's own voice. When someone says a performance moved them deeply, it's the strength of the music, not personal power. Maintaining this perspective prevents the arrogance that can easily develop when you're constantly at the center of attention as a performer.

## 11. Gender Discrimination in the Classical Music World

***"If you had a woman artist and a male artist doing more or less the same thing, I can assure you that the critic will be very careful about saying one word about the male but is happy to say anything about the lady."***

Gender discrimination pervades the classical music world in ways both obvious and subtle. Critics treat male and female artists differently—careful about criticizing men but freely saying anything about women. When Mudgal asks for basic requirements like a good microphone and an audio engineer for a vocalist who needs good sound and professional equipment handling, this is considered "difficult." If she specifies payment terms and requests payment no later than the date of the assignment, people respond that "so-and-so Pandit-ji and so-and-so Guru-ji have sung for us and never talked money with us." But that was them, this is her, and she would like to discuss terms with due respect to those who chose not to.

The lack of professionalism creates nightmares for artists. Getting paid too little happens only if you agree, but not getting paid on time, being forced to make multiple requests to retrieve your own money, and being humiliated for it—that's the life story of every artist, but women face additional layers of disrespect. People will remind you years later that "at that time you were not so well-known," as if your current status somehow retroactively changes the value of past work. The constant battle to get accompanying artists' names on publicity material—leave alone pictures—reveals deeper issues. Government programs will have thumbnails of all artists, sometimes even the politician's wife, but won't mention a single accompanying artist, all of whom have huge fan followings.

Mudgal has made it a point when asked to help raise funds to tell organizers she can perform but they must contact the artists directly, check if they want to be paid, how much they want, whether they can offer a discounted fee. She won't get involved because her experience has been that "Shubha-ji thank you" gets the flowers while accompanying artists don't even get a thank you. In Western situations, the name of either the entire group or each artist in the ensemble will be there. Why isn't this possible in India? The next concert Mudgal does, she's not sure the names will be mentioned. She can only send an email requesting it again, and they'll give her fifteen reasons for not including the names.

The discrimination extends to opportunities and recognition. During the difficult period after her marriage ended, Mudgal found that many artists who had invited her to collaborate later said they didn't want to offend Bhai (her former father-in-law and guru). She would respond that he was her father-in-law as well as her guru, he remains her guru, and he will never want to harm her in this way—they have interpreted him in a very petty way, which is their problem. The politics in the world of arts gets used to stoke mischief and controversy. While Mudgal acknowledges she's been helped a lot in finding her feet and voice, and at 66 still has a hectic concert schedule, she recognizes that on grouchy days she might complain about how women artists aren't treated fairly—because they aren't.

## 12. Political Co-option and Self-Censorship Among Artists

***"I was identified as anti-national long ago and trolled for various things. Forty-nine artists wrote an open letter to the prime minister—a very polite one—just saying that lynching is really bad. We immediately had a barrage of 60 or more saying we are anti-nationals and urban naxals."***

The political atmosphere has created deep polarization in the classical music world. When 49 artists wrote an open letter to the prime minister politely saying that lynching is really bad, they were immediately labeled anti-nationals and urban naxals by 60 or more people. Mudgal received threats from various sources and was trolled extensively. She has been on a blacklist for a long time. But the more disturbing aspect is that nobody has to go out co-opting artists—the artists are flocking. It's the other way around. The herds are reaching the doors of the providers. It's like what Lal Krishna Advani ironically said about journalists during the Emergency: they were asked to bend, they chose to crawl.

The situation in Hindustani classical music involves deep polarization and a very conflicted atmosphere. On one hand, something like Sufi music has become hugely popular—everybody is singing "Allahu, Allah, Ali Ali, Dam Ali Ali." But the same person will write a diatribe against a certain community. Everybody is singing abhangs by poets of the Bhakti movement, all of whom characteristically wrote about universal peace and brotherhood. The number of concerts is amazing and Mudgal is happy about it, but the philosophy seems disconnected from the practice. It's a strange situation where someone writes a terrible, distasteful post and then sings "we are all brothers, Ram and Rahim, everybody is the same."

This idea of choosing what you want from ideology is absolutely rampant among classical musicians. Some people now say that the history of Indian music was incorrectly written, that singers from the Hindu community were not given due importance or were forced to convert. Recently Mudgal saw a post asking why we have to call a form "Miya ki Todi"—why should it be called Miya ki Todi? All kinds of revisionism is happening. In Pakistan, a raga called "Durgeshwari" has been changed to a more Islamic name. So there are like-minded people on both sides engaging in similar distortions.

The dominant feature of the current regime that sets it apart is anti-Muslim sentiment. That is simply what it is—the dominant theme of what's going on in India over the last ten years. Mudgal would have imagined that Hindustani classical should be simply the opposite. It is so syncretic, so assimilative. So many legendary figures are Muslims. It is a melding of cultures, the best form of "khichdi." But the reality contradicts this ideal. The baggage of societal divisions—gender-related issues, exploitative practices, cutthroat policies, a sense of subservience—all exist in the world of music just as in Indian society generally. Artists don't discuss crucial issues like taxation for the arts or public health schemes for artists. During the lockdown, not a single government official tried to find out how artists were doing in their area. Did officials who got their salaries bother to call their award winners to find out whether they were dead or alive or all right?

## 13. The Evolution of Musical Forms and Technology

***"Amplification has really changed the way that we use our voices and our instruments. If you hear 78 RPM records of the great singers, particularly the women, everybody says what powerful voices. If they had not got that strength and volume, no impression would have been made on the wax."***

Musical forms evolve constantly in response to social situations, technology, and changing contexts. Gharanas came about because families wanted to keep music within themselves, creating divisions for reasons no longer relevant. What was considered authentic representation of Hindustani classical music has shifted over time. Dhrupad was considered the utmost form, but the makers and composers of Dhrupad themselves felt compelled—for artistic reasons primarily—to create khayal. While they composed khayal, they wouldn't sing it because it wasn't considered highbrow enough. Today khayal is considered very popular in classical music, while tumri is usually called semi-classical or light.

Within tumri, there have been many forms and types. There is the very vilambit (slow) bol-banao tumri. There were tumris sung with dance called bandish ki tumri. There were shorter, quicker-paced forms like dadra. Today you hear only the quicker forms. Very few people are specialists in the bol-banao style. Even within a span of 150 or 200 years, these changes have been happening. Amplification fundamentally changed how voices and instruments are used. Singers needed to throw their voices for theater-style projection when singing without amplification through the night. Those kinds of voices are no longer heard. A large number of voices today are perfectly suited for the microphone but wouldn't have succeeded in earlier eras.

Understanding of the dynamics of placing each instrument has changed. In older recordings, the tanpura is omnipresent with a nice warm tone—like an aural canvas on which the artist creates raga pictures. Today, in YouTube videos, the tanpura is visible but you won't hear it, or at best you'll hear it as a distant mosquito-whine sound. Many engineers, especially those not used to Indian music, find the tone of the tanpura intrusive. When mixing sound for live concerts or recordings, they start cutting out the tanpura sound, which defeats the purpose of having it because that is the canvas on which everything is done. These changes are happening rapidly.

Among accompanying artists, you don't hear as much sarangi; you hear more harmonium, which at one point was banned and considered inappropriate for India because it's an equally-tempered keyboard instrument. The feeling was that the kind of tonal nuances and shrutis to be used weren't possible. To some extent this is correct, but harmonium players and craftsmen have worked hard in terms of changing the instrument and playing techniques to overcome this. Still, it faces a stigma. Earlier you could audition for everything on All India Radio except harmonium—it was banned. Now they've started using harmonium but still don't give it the position of a mainstream solo instrument.

Technology has impacted how different forms are presented. When 60-minute cassettes came with 30 minutes per side, even though recordings were made for those cassettes and in live concerts, the duration of each raga started fitting that 30-minute format. Later it became 45 minutes with 90-minute cassettes. Even without that problem any longer because cassettes aren't used, the format is retained because people feel it has to be short, pithy, with lots of taans happening. But change has to happen, and people will find their ways around it. Different artists will find their ways of dealing with it. Some artists say this is the way they'd like to present and are happy with it. Others say no and begin differently—some great classical artists won't start with a classical piece but with a chorale or even "Jingle Bells" before moving into classical music. It's really a choice each artist must make for themselves.

## 14. Building a Life Partnership with Aneesh Pradhan

***"I had this crazy idea—we should start something for Indian music. I had no idea, no entrepreneurial skills, no idea of what it means to start a website, but I had all the enthusiasm."***

Mudgal first worked with Aneesh Pradhan when recording an album for a series on forms related to tumri—seasonal song forms like kajri, jhoola, chaiti. She had heard him accompany the legendary Shobha Gurtu and thought it would be great to have Aneesh and Purshottam Walawalkar on harmonium for this important tumri recording. She found his number, called his home, checked his availability, and they met. They had met a couple of times before but hadn't had a chance to perform together. After recording in Mumbai, they began working together more regularly.

In 1996, Mudgal was fascinated by gadgets and technology. When her son Dhaval suggested getting internet, she found it fascinating and thought they should start something for Indian music—an online magazine where artists could write or answer questions that would be transcribed and put online. She had crazy ideas about multimedia, asking artists for recordings and having them speak about what they presented. Big plans with no entrepreneurial skills or understanding of what starting a website meant, but total enthusiasm. She asked Aneesh if he would write for it and be part of the editorial team.

They set up ragsangeet.com and ran it for several years but had no support. They thought they would get support and be able to have a small team. It was a very grand, totally impractical plan, but they thought it was one way to engage students to work on music-related projects and earn some money through it. They never had the money, and at that time it was quite difficult and expensive to set up a website—not as inexpensive as now, though a good website is still not easy to run. They struggled with it and finally had to close it down. But during that period, Mudgal would meet Aneesh and work with him, exchanging many ideas.

Soon they thought about making the arrangement more permanent. In 2000, they got married. Mudgal was in the middle of recording an album and asked for a day off from the studio. She was recording "Mann Ke Manjeere" produced by Mallika Dutt. When Mudgal asked for March 9th off, Mallika said no problem—record on the 8th and come back on the 10th. When Mudgal returned the next day, Mallika asked how the concert was. Mudgal said she didn't have a concert. Mallika asked what other work she had. Mudgal replied, "I was getting married," and was back in the studio the next day. This work ethic—treating commitments as sacred, never missing obligations except for her mother's death—characterizes both Mudgal and Aneesh. They've had run-ins where he said yes to somebody else and then she got a prestigious concert, but he said sorry, he'd already committed. They both value professionalism highly.

## 15. The Absence of Collective Organization Among Musicians

***"I had this fairy tale idea of forming a collective of artists. I have abandoned it since. Why? Because it has to be run professionally and there can be no two ways about that. It cannot be my baap ki property. It cannot be my feudal little castle from where I issue orders."***

The lack of a collective voice among artists means that battles for basic dignity become personal rather than systemic. Mudgal constantly fights to get accompanying artists' names on publicity material, leave alone pictures. In government programs, you'll have thumbnails of all the politicians, sometimes even the politician's wife, but not a single mention of accompanying artists who all have huge fan followings. It's a running battle she keeps fighting, but what is she supposed to do? Send another email requesting names, receive fifteen reasons why they can't be included, and repeat the cycle for the next concert.

Artists are to blame for not having a collective. Some things have to be adhered to—basic requirements like listing the names of three or four people on stage. These are accomplished artists whom the audience applauds when they play. Why is it such an uphill task? Mudgal once had a fairy tale idea of forming a collective of artists but has abandoned it. The reason is that it has to be run professionally with no two ways about that. It cannot be "my baap ki property" or a feudal little castle from which orders are issued. It has to be a space that believes in equality and fair professional standards.

She doesn't think it matters to enough people to have a professionally run collective. Otherwise, so many issues related to the arts would be addressed. There's almost an attitude of being grateful to organizers in a very subservient way. Artists these days are invited to government festivals and evidently all sent a message saying "I'm very grateful for this opportunity"—exactly the same message, and everybody's happy doing that. Mudgal doesn't have an issue saying she's happy singing in a festival, but she doesn't want to be sent a message telling her she has to say it, with the implicit threat that if she doesn't, she won't get another program.

There's a complete lack of awareness about what a collective could possibly do and no will to create one. Too many rifts exist. The same rifts and issues seen in Indian society are rife in the world of music—gender-related issues, exploitative practices, cutthroat policies, a sense of subservience. Why would artists not discuss something as important as taxation for the arts? Why not discuss public health schemes for artists? During the lockdown and those two years, not a single government official tried to find out how artists in their area were doing. Officials got their salaries—did they bother to make a call to their award winners to find out whether they were dead or alive or all right? Leave alone grants-in-aid or money during difficulties, just the reassurance of a call that you matter, we know you're there, we hope you're in okay health. Expecting more would be foolish.

The loss of major artists was painful—hearing they couldn't get hospital beds. But what about artists in remote areas? What were they supposed to do? Nobody thought about it, and when schemes existed, they were about videos made for spreading positivity. You don't want positivity in a COVID infection—you want practical help, and that wasn't there. Nobody has bothered to assess what was done or not done and how to help artists if a similar situation arises again. It's total apathy. The music industry couldn't care less. Virtually every big online digital platform available in India has fancy offices and well-trained staff, holds conferences about music at seven-star luxury venues, but you'll find not even 1% of traditional musicians involved. It's like they don't exist.

**Recommended Listening and Reading:**

***"There is something about artists like Nusrat-ji—that term called 'asar' and 'tasir' in any art, that ability to touch and to move people. His voice was full of gravel and texture, sometimes it even breaks when he's hitting very high notes, but when he sings, it's that quality that speaks to you."***

Mudgal recommends several artists and works for deeper engagement with music. **Begum Akhtar** stands as an iconic artist whose singing illustrates "asar" and "tasir"—the ability to touch and move people. Her identification and intimacy with both poetic and musical forms is inspiring. A specific entry point is an album she did with Ghulam Ali Sahab, very well recorded with good sonic quality for today's audiences used to crystal-clear recordings. Songs like "Ae Mohabbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aaya" or "Hamari Atariya Pe Aao" were arranged and produced to fit a song format yet retain a relaxation in her singing that doesn't make them seem like tight, highly produced tracks.

**Siddheshwari Devi** is another essential artist, though her recordings won't have the audio quality available for more recent artists. She possesses that quality discussed regarding Nusrat—letting go in an abandoned way with no self-consciousness. Mudgal wishes she could reach that point where she's not bothered about the voice sounding pretty or just right, where communication is paramount. A recent recording Mudgal heard of Siddheshwari Devi in raga Bhairavi—"Gagar Bhar Ke Piya Ke Des Chali"—uses a lovely metaphor for wholehearted obsession with music or writing or whatever one loves with deep passion. You don't even realize where it's all going to take you, yet through ups and downs, that's what you want to do.

**"Latcho Drom"** is a documentary about gypsies across the world, following their journey from various parts including India. There is no spoken word—it's all through music. It's a powerful documentary. Mudgal doesn't have a good copy, but parts are available on YouTube. **"Yeh Kothewaali"** by Amritlal Nagar is a very important book because today the courtesan culture is romanticized in many ways. Singers try to wear costumes like courtesans but don't sing with the same sense of fun and coquetry. Nagar's book gives a real picture because he interviewed many women artists, recording all the information they provided. It's written in Hindi, though someone is doing an English translation. These works provide entry points into understanding the depth, diversity, and emotional power of Indian classical music and the culture surrounding it.
