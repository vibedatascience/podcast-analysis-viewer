DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
The Club World Cup starts this weekend with the delights of Auckland City and the new time wasting rules to look forward to. Are we excited? England are humbled 3-1 by Senegal in friendly action. Is this just history repeating itself? And what will Thomas Tuchel gain from appearing to publicly criticise Jude Bellingham?

USA are also booed off after a home friendly thrashing, their 4th defeat in a row. Paul Tenorio tells us why these are tough times for Mauricio Pochettino.
We bring you the draw for the Inter Totally Cup, featuring three-time winner and current champion Michael Cox. Plus Sterling hits the side netting, Tom eats burgers and what season is it anyway?

Jimbo is joined in the studio by Duncan Alexander, Tom Williams and Tim Spiers to talk about the endless football.

But it does sound funny saying a classic it does sound funny saying a classic number five. Classic number five number five. Classic number five personal says Chelsea have already personal says Chelsea have already signed six players paiso signed six players paiso pendas isugo sa and dap and they've pendas isugo sa and dap and they've already spent close to 150 million who already spent close to 150 million who do you think they should sign next asked do you think they should sign next asked prasana perhaps ironically at the end prasana perhaps ironically at the end I'm not sure they've also done a weird I'm not sure they've also done a weird thing where they well not too weird but thing where they well not too weird but they brought their players back from they brought their players back from loan like sterling and Renato Vega who's loan like sterling and Renato Vega who's I think done quite well at Juventus on I think done quite well at Juventus on loan and now has come back but isn't loan and now has come back but isn't going to the club world cup with Chelsea going to the club world cup with Chelsea or Juventus who's quite a good player or Juventus who's quite a good player played a lot of football all season but played a lot of football all season but is just will not be playing for either is just will not be playing for either team at the club world cup because team at the club world cup because that's Chelsea's decision they've got that's Chelsea's decision they've got too many players some of it they must too many players some of it they must just forget about they've got so many just forget about they've got so many guys um Renato Vegas agent oh my god guys um Renato Vegas agent oh my god Renato I knew we'd miss someone off is Renato I knew we'd miss someone off is it too it's too late the deadlines go oh it too it's too late the deadlines go oh god well they also like pleas where they god well they also like pleas where they buy them so early and then they forget buy them so early and then they forget they bought something when you've they bought something when you've ordered something and then it comes like ordered something and then it comes like two months lady like what's this? Oh two months lady like what's this? Oh yeah, I remember. I've There's a young yeah, I remember. I've There's a young Brazilian lad. He says he's the new 80 Brazilian lad.

Live scenes from Chelsea's squad porch. Live scenes from Chelsea's squad development. But also that highlights to development. But also that highlights to me that this is not still this season me that this is not still this season because Sterling, for example, he was on because Sterling, for example, he was on loan at Arsenal for the rest of the loan at Arsenal for the rest of the season. He's now back at Chelsea. Could season. He's now back at Chelsea. Could play the World Cup, but he isn't. But in play the World Cup, but he isn't. But in theory, he could. That's why for me it's theory, he could. That's why for me it's causing great stress. What do we say in causing great stress. What do we say in the in the football media because the in the football media because morally it's still this season. It is. morally it's still this season. It is. Yeah. So, so what's the stress? So, if Yeah. So, so what's the stress? So, if you're Arsenal M last season means 20 24 you're Arsenal M last season means 20 24 25 but if you're Chelsea you're in the 25 but if you're Chelsea you're in the club world cup last season really means club world cup last season really means 2023 24 because you're still in 2024 25. 2023 24 because you're still in 2024 25. So it's um it's a bit messy but so will So it's um it's a bit messy but so will appearance data going forward the club appearance data going forward the club world cup will count 2425? It should be, world cup will count 2425? It should be, shouldn't it? I read a piece recently shouldn't it? I read a piece recently where someone referred to 2425 as last where someone referred to 2425 as last season and it completely threw me season and it completely threw me because because I thought they meant 23 because because I thought they meant 23 24. Well, traditionally it was once you 24. Well, traditionally it was once you got to June, then it becomes last got to June, then it becomes last season, but now the Champions League season, but now the Champions League final off your traditions, Duncan.

Um, and I mean, yeah, I'm not sure how much of a I mean, yeah, I'm not sure how much of a how much of an achievement being the how much of an achievement being the first African team to ever beat England first African team to ever beat England feels like to them. I suspect it feels like to them. I suspect it probably feels, you know, pretty probably feels, you know, pretty significant. And I think it's gone to a significant. And I think it's gone to a team, you know, who are who are decent team, you know, who are who are decent and and, you know, deserve to be deserve and and, you know, deserve to be picking up, you know, accolades to be picking up, you know, accolades for the for the quality of their for the for the quality of their football. Excellent. What's England's football. Excellent. What's England's next game, Tim? I was just say we forget next game, Tim? I was just say we forget that there were so many of these games that there were so many of these games under South Kate and we forget because under South Kate and we forget because they were so forgettable, but they they were so forgettable, but they happened all the time. I like I don't happened all the time. I like I don't have huge concerns. He hasn't had a have huge concerns. He hasn't had a honeymoon period which is and the honeymoon period which is and the players don't look completely harmonious players don't look completely harmonious which might be a bit of an issue but which might be a bit of an issue but buildups of tournaments like the Terry buildups of tournaments like the Terry Venibals before E96 England were awful Venibals before E96 England were awful for about two years they drew every game for about two years they drew every game pretty much it was just loads of turgid pretty much it was just loads of turgid friendlies at Wembley but I mean they friendlies at Wembley but I mean they weren't that great at Europe but apart weren't that great at Europe but apart from against the Netherlands but you from against the Netherlands but you know it has no bearing on the on the No know it has no bearing on the on the No it doesn't the Southgate thing just it doesn't the Southgate thing just annoys me this far too soon to be annoys me this far too soon to be talking about that where you can compare talking about that where you can compare him with Southgate and where what I him with Southgate and where what I really don't like what he's done is his really don't like what he's done is his comments about Bellingham in an comments about Bellingham in an interview yesterday saying suggesting interview yesterday saying suggesting that his behavior on the field can be that his behavior on the field can be repulsive now he's speaking in his repulsive now he's speaking in his second language so you got to maybe cut second language so you got to maybe cut some slack on that and I'm I've read it some slack on that and I'm I've read it not heard it so I don't know if it's not heard it so I don't know if it's taken out context but it's a very strong taken out context but it's a very strong word to use and the the general vibe is word to use and the the general vibe is that he's having a having a knock at his that he's having a having a knock at his onfield behavior which is the first sign onfield behavior which is the first sign of him being abrasive with his players of him being abrasive with his players and he falls out with his players and and he falls out with his players and that doesn't bode well for me. I I I that doesn't bode well for me. I I I find the comments quite disappointing find the comments quite disappointing actually. Again, maybe they've been actually. Again, maybe they've been taken out of context, maybe not. But to taken out of context, maybe not. But to start criticizing your pretty much your start criticizing your pretty much your best player in public, I just don't I best player in public, I just don't I don't understand what what he's going to don't understand what what he's going to achieve from that really other than achieve from that really other than annoy Bellingham, which I'm sure he has annoy Bellingham, which I'm sure he has done. Yeah. And to use his mom as the done. Yeah. And to use his mom as the sort of conduit to do it as well, which sort of conduit to do it as well, which is a bit strange. Yeah. And that's where is a bit strange. Yeah. And that's where South SK would would never do that. We South SK would would never do that. We talked about his own, wasn't he? Two talked about his own, wasn't he? Two rather than rather than rather than Yeah, that would have been worse. But Yeah, that would have been worse. But does any does is there any good from a does any does is there any good from a manager doing that in any sort of manager doing that in any sort of workplace, you know, calling out your workplace, you know, calling out your your top performer and saying their your top performer and saying their behavior is a bit repulsive? It's a behavior is a bit repulsive? It's a really I suspect repulsive was was really I suspect repulsive was was probably a I think something's been lost probably a I think something's been lost in translation slightly. in translation slightly. I don't think he meant repulsive in the I don't think he meant repulsive in the way that we understand the word way that we understand the word repulsive. I suspect he was looking for repulsive. I suspect he was looking for a word to reflect a word to reflect a kind of behavior that people find a kind of behavior that people find slightly repellent perhaps. Maybe that slightly repellent perhaps. Maybe that was the word he was looking for. And he was the word he was looking for. And he ended up with but he also said oh he ended up with but he also said oh he sort of intimidates his his teammates. I sort of intimidates his his teammates. I mean is that is that true? Is that fair? mean is that is that true? Is that fair? I mean he's but look at what he's doing I mean he's but look at what he's doing in his in his career. you know, he's in his in his career. you know, he's he's one of Real Madrid's best players. he's one of Real Madrid's best players. He's one of the best players in Europe. He's one of the best players in Europe. Why are we trying to change him already? Why are we trying to change him already? And you can see this creeping into the And you can see this creeping into the media as well. And this always happens. media as well. And this always happens. Well, there was the reaction to his Well, there was the reaction to his reaction to the disallowed goal, which reaction to the disallowed goal, which across various papers amounted to him across various papers amounted to him going full cantonar kung fu kick on a on going full cantonar kung fu kick on a on a water cooler. But doesn't seem to be a water cooler. But doesn't seem to be when you watch the footage, you seem when you watch the footage, you seem pretty reasonable about that. Exactly. pretty reasonable about that. Exactly. But he's he's clearly got a winners But he's he's clearly got a winners mentality, which is something that mentality, which is something that England have lacked in many many areas. England have lacked in many many areas. It's repulsive, isn't it? No. I don't It's repulsive, isn't it? No. I don't know. It's it's not a good sign for me. know. It's it's not a good sign for me. And that that's where you do miss And that that's where you do miss Southgate because I hear you. Yeah, I Southgate because I hear you. Yeah, I hear you. Woof. Anyway, there you go. Uh hear you.

Uh, with that in mind, what else happened in mind, what else happened internationally? Well, Tom, you went off internationally? Well, Tom, you went off to Brussels to Brussels to Brussels as a civilian to watch Belgium, Wales. as a civilian to watch Belgium, Wales. What prompted that trip? Um, What prompted that trip? Um, the desire to go and watch Wales away uh the desire to go and watch Wales away uh in a a pleasant Wales, European capital. in a a pleasant Wales, European capital. This may have come up before, Duncan. This may have come up before, Duncan. Yes. Uh, and a friend of mine was going, Yes. Uh, and a friend of mine was going, my friend Dom, um, sort us out with my friend Dom, um, sort us out with tickets and yeah, it was it was a very tickets and yeah, it was it was a very enjoyable trip and it momentarily looked enjoyable trip and it momentarily looked as if we were about to witness something as if we were about to witness something truly historic. Before that, it wasn't truly historic. Before that, it wasn't quite as enjoyable because you were you quite as enjoyable because you were you found yourself 3-0 down in short. 3 down found yourself 3-0 down in short. 3 down inside 27 minutes. an extremely soft inside 27 minutes. an extremely soft penalty which Romelo Romelo Lukaku penalty which Romelo Romelo Lukaku scored a really nicely taken Yuri scored a really nicely taken Yuri Tieleman's goal and then a very poorly Tieleman's goal and then a very poorly defended Jeremy Dou goal and Belgian defended Jeremy Dou goal and Belgian hadn't really had to do much they hadn't hadn't really had to do much they hadn't had to push all that hard Wales were a had to push all that hard Wales were a bit too open Craig Bellamir talked about bit too open Craig Bellamir talked about how they were going to you know going to how they were going to you know going to go on the attack um and yeah 3-0 down go on the attack um and yeah 3-0 down less than half an hour on the clock less than half an hour on the clock wondering how bad it's going to get wondering how bad it's going to get Wales reduced the Aras in first of first Wales reduced the Aras in first of first off stoppage time Harry Wilson penalty off stoppage time Harry Wilson penalty uh and then scored a beautifully uh and then scored a beautifully constructed goal. Uh Sora Thomas teed up constructed goal. Uh Sora Thomas teed up by Harry Wilson uh six minutes into the by Harry Wilson uh six minutes into the second half and suddenly the Wales end second half and suddenly the Wales end is just you know sort of full of belief. is just you know sort of full of belief. uh Brennan Johnson teed up by Sora uh Brennan Johnson teed up by Sora Thomas equalizes 20 minutes from the end Thomas equalizes 20 minutes from the end and if you'd called fulltime there like and if you'd called fulltime there like I think every Wales fan would have taken I think every Wales fan would have taken it to come from 3-0 down away from home it to come from 3-0 down away from home hardest game in the group and we've got hardest game in the group and we've got this good record against Belgium so this good record against Belgium so there's always that belief that you know there's always that belief that you know there's a chance of of doing something there's a chance of of doing something Belgium go back on the attack Lukaku has Belgium go back on the attack Lukaku has a goal ruled out um because the ball had a goal ruled out um because the ball had gone out of play after like a V stoppage gone out of play after like a V stoppage of about 4 minutes and I must admit I of about 4 minutes and I must admit I very rarely go to top level matches as a very rarely go to top level matches as a fan these days. I think there were maybe fan these days. I think there were maybe four or five V reviews during the game. four or five V reviews during the game. Um and they just killed it. I mean every Um and they just killed it. I mean every single time I think like four or five of single time I think like four or five of the seven goals, you know, had to be V the seven goals, you know, had to be V reviewed anyway. 3-3 couple minutes left reviewed anyway. 3-3 couple minutes left to go. Wales clear a corner, don't to go. Wales clear a corner, don't defend the second ball. Kevin De Bruyne defend the second ball. Kevin De Bruyne goes in at the back post and tucks it in goes in at the back post and tucks it in left foot. I mean that beautifully taken left foot. I mean that beautifully taken goal, Belgium four, Wales three. Uh but goal, Belgium four, Wales three. Uh but yeah, a very enjoyable excursion yeah, a very enjoyable excursion nevertheless.

Um, now if they do breach the 8second mark, if they do breach the 8second mark, which the referee should be telling them which the referee should be telling them by making his arm look like a clock. So by making his arm look like a clock. So excitingly, he's going to he's going to excitingly, he's going to count to five in his head with his hand count to five in his head with his hand aloft. And once he gets to five, he's aloft. And once he gets to five, he's going to start doing the old Ted Rogers going to start doing the old Ted Rogers 3 2 1 with his fingers. And apparently 3 2 1 with his fingers. And apparently that's going to be a feature of every that's going to be a feature of every single game. I'm in favor of this. When single game. I'm in favor of this. When they when they first brought in the 56 they when they first brought in the 56 second law, keepers did get done for it. second law, keepers did get done for it. And it was and it was tremendous because And it was and it was tremendous because the fans were just there. How many the fans were just there. How many seconds? 5 6 7 But um what happens here seconds? 5 6 7 But um what happens here if the 8-second mark is breached? Yes. if the 8-second mark is breached? Yes. You get a corner. The other team get a You get a corner. The other team get a corner. And corner. The other team get a corner.

You're going to need decent eyesight to You're going to need decent eyesight to see the 321 from like the halfway line. see the 321 from like the halfway line. You know, if you're short, I mean, You know, if you're short, I mean, short-sighted goalkeepers aren't that short-sighted goalkeepers aren't that prevalent at the top level. I don't prevalent at the top level. I don't think you're gonna have other issues. think you're gonna have other issues. I'm thinking I prefer like the the I'm thinking I prefer like the the countdown in in countdown in in the arms the position of the arms of the the arms the position of the arms of the clock. No, but just no countdown only clock. No, but just no countdown only has one one arm. If they play the has one one arm.

By the way, there was also the USA, By the way, there was also the USA, Mauricio Puchino's USA, who lost 4-nil Mauricio Puchino's USA, who lost 4-nil to Switzerland in Nashville, the Swiss to Switzerland in Nashville, the Swiss scoring all four goals in a 23-minute scoring all four goals in a 23-minute spell in the first half against a spell in the first half against a national team of the USA who have now national team of the USA who have now lost four games in a row for the first lost four games in a row for the first time in 18 years. We caught up with the time in 18 years. We caught up with the Athletics Paul Tonorio after the game Athletics Paul Tonorio after the game and we began by asking him where after and we began by asking him where after four straight defeats in charge, this four straight defeats in charge, this leaves big Mauricio. Yeah, I think it's leaves big Mauricio. Yeah, I think it's fairly serious because he's kind of fairly serious because he's kind of battling on multiple fronts right now. battling on multiple fronts right now. Going into this summer, it became Going into this summer, it became complicated because then, you know, complicated because then, you know, Christian Pulysic asked for the summer Christian Pulysic asked for the summer off. He felt he needed rest after off. He felt he needed rest after playing 50 games for Milan for the playing 50 games for Milan for the second season in a row and Anthony second season in a row and Anthony Robinson got a knee surgery and Wes and Robinson got a knee surgery and Wes and McKenna and Tim Way are at the club McKenna and Tim Way are at the club World Cup and Sergino Dest knee is not World Cup and Sergino Dest knee is not 100% ready yet. Well, Ballagan uh is out 100% ready yet. Well, Ballagan uh is out injured. So all of these regulars injured. So all of these regulars started to drop off the team and so more started to drop off the team and so more and more of these kind of B or C team and more of these kind of B or C team players came into the group and so now players came into the group and so now kind of the idea of injecting one or two kind of the idea of injecting one or two or three or four personalities into the or three or four personalities into the team to send a message I think has team to send a message I think has backfired right because this group the backfired right because this group the way that they lost yesterday they were way that they lost yesterday they were they were not up to the to the level of they were not up to the to the level of Switzerland the the players that were on Switzerland the the players that were on the field and and to be clear also I the field and and to be clear also I should note Pochettino rotated nine new should note Pochettino rotated nine new players into the team from the group players into the team from the group that lost 2-1 to Turkey and and those that lost 2-1 to Turkey and and those players the players who started against players the players who started against Turkey are are the more likely to quote Turkey are are the more likely to quote unquote push the West and Mckennis and unquote push the West and Mckennis and the Ununis Musas and and and those types the Ununis Musas and and and those types you know but but it still sends the you know but but it still sends the wrong message I think and and they wrong message I think and and they didn't have that energy and emotion and didn't have that energy and emotion and so now you get to a point again where so now you get to a point again where you're fighting on multiple fronts where you're fighting on multiple fronts where the message you're trying to send your the message you're trying to send your best players is falling flat because best players is falling flat because they're looking at that performance they're looking at that performance saying, "We're not really concerned saying, "We're not really concerned about these guys pushing us." The about these guys pushing us." The message to the fans is falling flat message to the fans is falling flat because you've now lost four in a row because you've now lost four in a row and it was a listless performance last and it was a listless performance last night against Switzerland. You know, night against Switzerland. You know, where is the hope coming from? And where is the hope coming from? And Pochettino, you know, I don't think Pochettino, you know, I don't think feels fully comfortable in this job yet. feels fully comfortable in this job yet. you know, he gave this interview with you know, he gave this interview with Andreas Canour, the famous broadcaster, Andreas Canour, the famous broadcaster, um, who's based here in the US, does um, who's based here in the US, does Telmundo, the famous gold calls, uh, Telmundo, the famous gold calls, uh, here in the US. Canour is an Argentinian here in the US. Canour is an Argentinian just like Pochettino. And as part of just like Pochettino. And as part of that interview, he talked about some of that interview, he talked about some of the discourse of, you know, does the discourse of, you know, does Pochettino understand the culture of Pochettino understand the culture of American soccer? And it was clear American soccer? And it was clear Pochettino had heard that and was Pochettino had heard that and was offended by that. and he spoke about, offended by that. and he spoke about, you know, of course we know the culture you know, of course we know the culture and the culture of football is and the culture of football is universal. It's global and it just seems universal. It's global and it just seems like he is kind of trying to put out like he is kind of trying to put out fires left, right, and center. And I I fires left, right, and center. And I I don't really know where he gets out of don't really know where he gets out of it. You know, the the hope would be, of it. You know, the the hope would be, of course, that the US puts a little bit of course, that the US puts a little bit of a run together this summer's Gold Cup a run together this summer's Gold Cup with this with this kind of piece with this with this kind of piece together team, but really it it puts an together team, but really it it puts an enormous amount of pressure on Maicio enormous amount of pressure on Maicio Pochettino for September, October, and Pochettino for September, October, and November in those friendlies where you November in those friendlies where you hopefully get kind of the full team hopefully get kind of the full team together and and start really trying to together and and start really trying to do something that builds anything do something that builds anything positive ahead of the World Cup. Mhm. positive ahead of the World Cup. Mhm. Well, the Gold Cup gets underway this Well, the Gold Cup gets underway this weekend. 16 teams, including the US, of weekend. 16 teams, including the US, of course, and Saudi Arabia, who've been course, and Saudi Arabia, who've been invited as special guests, which is invited as special guests, which is heartwarming. Also starting this heartwarming. Also starting this weekend, we got the Club World Cup also weekend, we got the Club World Cup also taking place in the United States. At taking place in the United States. At least that's been a roaring success so least that's been a roaring success so far, with the tickets to the opener um far, with the tickets to the opener um hard to give away. Is that right, Paul? hard to give away. Is that right, Paul? Yeah, I mean, look, I I expect that the Yeah, I mean, look, I I expect that the knockout rounds of this tournament are knockout rounds of this tournament are going to be well attended. I think going to be well attended. I think people will get excited by some of these people will get excited by some of these games as the tournament moves on, but games as the tournament moves on, but right now, you know, they're not. There right now, you know, they're not. There are matchups that aren't that appealing. are matchups that aren't that appealing. I think the the decision to place Inter I think the the decision to place Inter Miami games in Miami, if you're worried Miami games in Miami, if you're worried about selling tickets, was the wrong about selling tickets, was the wrong idea. Messi sells out stadiums all idea. Messi sells out stadiums all around the country and you stuck them in around the country and you stuck them in the biggest stadium in the home market the biggest stadium in the home market where people can go watch them every where people can go watch them every single weekend for $30 and expect him to single weekend for $30 and expect him to buy these tickets for 100, 200 is where buy these tickets for 100, 200 is where the prices started. and that just kind the prices started. and that just kind of fell on its face. I think you know of fell on its face. I think you know this summer is so important for me in in this summer is so important for me in in kind of some of the institutions to kind of some of the institutions to recognize recognize recognize um you know what this American market is um you know what this American market is about. You know I'm writing a book about about. You know I'm writing a book about the Messi effect and and the book is the Messi effect and and the book is about Messi's arrival here but it's about Messi's arrival here but it's really about where the sport is in this really about where the sport is in this country. There is an enormous appetite country. There is an enormous appetite for football in the US. Enormous. But for football in the US. Enormous. But you know these fans are also they're no you know these fans are also they're no longer kind of new to it. We can watch longer kind of new to it. We can watch any Premier League game on the weekend. any Premier League game on the weekend. Literally any game. We can watch the Literally any game. We can watch the Bundesliga, the La Liga, Champions Bundesliga, the La Liga, Champions League. Every single competition there League. Every single competition there is, we have access to it by the push of is, we have access to it by the push of a button. And fans want the best and a button. And fans want the best and they they want good product. And so I they they want good product. And so I think there is going to be a moment here think there is going to be a moment here where, you know, FIFA has a reckoning of where, you know, FIFA has a reckoning of of kind of what the expectations are, of kind of what the expectations are, the saturation of the sport in the the saturation of the sport in the market, where the prices should be. I market, where the prices should be. I think major league soccer is going to think major league soccer is going to have a reckoning and seeing its teams go have a reckoning and seeing its teams go up against some of the better teams in up against some of the better teams in the world and and some of the better the world and and some of the better teams in this hemisphere and I think US teams in this hemisphere and I think US soccer is getting a reckoning as well soccer is getting a reckoning as well and Maisio Pochettino in terms of the and Maisio Pochettino in terms of the strength of its pool. I it's an strength of its pool. I it's an enormously important summer for kind of enormously important summer for kind of looking in the mirror I think for for looking in the mirror I think for for American soccer. Paul last summer was an American soccer. Paul last summer was an important one too with the corporate important one too with the corporate America in the states and prices were America in the states and prices were were a problem then as well as pitches were a problem then as well as pitches and policing. Very briefly, do you think and policing. Very briefly, do you think this summer's tournament is going to this summer's tournament is going to suffer from those same issues as regards suffer from those same issues as regards the last two or or have lessons been the last two or or have lessons been learned? Well, I think the, you know, learned? Well, I think the, you know, the biggest difference between last the biggest difference between last summer and this is that FIFA staging summer and this is that FIFA staging this tournament whereas KMA bowl staged this tournament whereas KMA bowl staged the Copa America and that's where I the Copa America and that's where I think the trouble started. Come bowl, think the trouble started. Come bowl, you know, looked at the success of the you know, looked at the success of the Copa America Centennio in 2016, which Copa America Centennio in 2016, which was run not by Come Bowl, but by Conqua was run not by Come Bowl, but by Conqua Cafe, uh, Major League Soccer's Cafe, uh, Major League Soccer's marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing, marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing, and US Soccer. Well, what they saw was and US Soccer. Well, what they saw was that those companies made a tremendous that those companies made a tremendous amount of money on a KOM ball amount of money on a KOM ball tournament. So, KO ball took over tournament. So, KO ball took over operations. They had very little operations. They had very little experience staging a tournament in this experience staging a tournament in this country. And I think that's where you country. And I think that's where you saw issues with kind of the ticket saw issues with kind of the ticket prices. I think certainly that's where prices. I think certainly that's where you saw issues with security in the at you saw issues with security in the at the Copa America final and the pitches I the Copa America final and the pitches I think will be a non-issue completely think will be a non-issue completely because this is being used as a test run because this is being used as a test run for next summer's World Cup. The pitches for next summer's World Cup. The pitches that are being put together here in this that are being put together here in this country are being shipped to the country are being shipped to the stadiums where that are going to host stadiums where that are going to host World Cup games next year. There's a World Cup games next year. There's a much different way to put the field onto much different way to put the field onto over top of the plastic turf. Um it it over top of the plastic turf. Um it it should play much differently. It did in should play much differently. It did in March in the Nations League in Los March in the Nations League in Los Angeles. So I don't think there will be Angeles. So I don't think there will be a repeat of last summer and I think I a repeat of last summer and I think I hope Come ball maybe learned some hope Come ball maybe learned some lessons as well about it's not so simple lessons as well about it's not so simple to stage a tournament. Now again it was to stage a tournament. Now again it was an enormous financial success for Come an enormous financial success for Come Ball which I think is what they they Ball which I think is what they they were mostly concerned about. But you were mostly concerned about. But you know that'll be the case with the know that'll be the case with the tournaments this summer too and with tournaments this summer too and with next summer again there is this enormous next summer again there is this enormous appetite for the sport in this country. appetite for the sport in this country. People are going to go to these games. People are going to go to these games. They're going to pay top dollar once we They're going to pay top dollar once we get to the knockouts to go watch teams get to the knockouts to go watch teams like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. But like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. But the logistical side of things, it's the logistical side of things, it's still complicated. And I think an still complicated. And I think an organization like FIFA, you know, we'll organization like FIFA, you know, we'll have a better grip of that than Kball have a better grip of that than Kball did. All right, Tom, now that you're did. All right, Tom, now that you're fully excited about the Club World Cup, fully excited about the Club World Cup, anything else that you're eager to see anything else that you're eager to see in this 32 team in this 32 team event? I mean, it's a classic World Cup event? I mean, it's a classic World Cup format, except instead of national format, except instead of national sides, you've got clubs, haven't you? sides, you've got clubs, haven't you? clubs from six continents and 20 clubs from six continents and 20 countries. Oo, competing countries. Oo, competing for a total prize pool of inserts index for a total prize pool of inserts index finger $1 billion. Play. I mean, I'm yeah, intrigued as to Play. I mean, I'm yeah, intrigued as to how PSG will get on as newly crowned how PSG will get on as newly crowned European champions. And again, one of European champions. And again, one of the novelties of this tournament is that the novelties of this tournament is that they are not putting this title on the they are not putting this title on the line, but they are putting their freshly line, but they are putting their freshly acquired status as Europe's best team. acquired status as Europe's best team. and erggo, the world's best team on the and erggo, the world's best team on the line, you know, a matter of days after, line, you know, a matter of days after, you know, after scaling the the mountain you know, after scaling the the mountain uh of the Champions League at long last. uh of the Champions League at long last. Uh and yeah, I'd like to go Madrid in Uh and yeah, I'd like to go Madrid in the first fixture. There are easier the first fixture. There are easier opening games to have to contend with. opening games to have to contend with. Usman Dembele is with the squad, but is Usman Dembele is with the squad, but is injured. He's got a thigh injury, so I injured. He's got a thigh injury, so I don't think he'll be involved against don't think he'll be involved against Atletico. Um and I think they'll be Atletico. Um and I think they'll be hoping that he can he can play some part hoping that he can he can play some part later on. Um but yeah, it's sort of later on. Um but yeah, it's sort of interesting to see how the particularly interesting to see how the particularly the big European clubs approach it. Is the big European clubs approach it. Is there a potential advantage for there a potential advantage for particularly the South American clubs at particularly the South American clubs at the European clubs coming off the back the European clubs coming off the back of you know a long season that of you know a long season that historically these kind of historically these kind of intercontinental tournaments you've intercontinental tournaments you've tended to see super motivated South tended to see super motivated South American clubs and big European clubs American clubs and big European clubs you aren't really sure how much they you aren't really sure how much they care about it.
