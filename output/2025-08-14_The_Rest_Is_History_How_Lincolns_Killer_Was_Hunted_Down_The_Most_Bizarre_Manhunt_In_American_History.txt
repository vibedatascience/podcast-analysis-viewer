So that was John Wils Booth, great So that was John Wils Booth, great Shakespearean actor. Dominic, you Shakespearean actor. Dominic, you described him in the previous episode as described him in the previous episode as being very much the Brian Blessed School being very much the Brian Blessed School of Acting. And he wrote that in his of Acting. And he wrote that in his journal on the 21st of April 1865 journal on the 21st of April 1865 while he was on the run for the murder while he was on the run for the murder of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States. And the murder of of the United States. And the murder of Lincoln often framed as being one of the Lincoln often framed as being one of the most consequential crimes in American most consequential crimes in American history. People say that it changed the history. People say that it changed the course of uh the destiny of the United course of uh the destiny of the United States. People ponder whether the dark States. People ponder whether the dark and tragic story of American race and tragic story of American race relations throughout reconstruction into relations throughout reconstruction into the the 1950s and60s might it have been the the 1950s and60s might it have been different? Might the story of the former different? Might the story of the former rebel South have been transformed had rebel South have been transformed had Lincoln lived? And I guess we'll be Lincoln lived? And I guess we'll be trying to answer those questions later trying to answer those questions later in today's episode. But for now, you in today's episode. But for now, you left us at the end of the previous left us at the end of the previous episode on an absolute cliffhanger. episode on an absolute cliffhanger. President and Mrs. Lincoln are sitting President and Mrs. Lincoln are sitting there enjoying a brilliant British there enjoying a brilliant British comedy about an American hick who has comedy about an American hick who has come to lay claim to a stately home in come to lay claim to a stately home in England.

Wilks Booth steps into Lincoln's box. Well, or does he leap, Tom? Because we Well, or does he leap, Tom? Because we discussed before that he loves leaping discussed before that he loves leaping and capering when he's on stage. And and capering when he's on stage. And that was the one thing I think that was that was the one thing I think that was missing from an excellent rendition of missing from an excellent rendition of uh your reading from Booth's journal. So uh your reading from Booth's journal. So just to remind people where we are, we just to remind people where we are, we are in Ford's Theater on 10th Street in are in Ford's Theater on 10th Street in Washington DC on the evening of Good Washington DC on the evening of Good Friday the 4th of April 1865, 5 days Friday the 4th of April 1865, 5 days after Robert E.

A have come to the city to celebrate. A lot of them have been drawn to the lot of them have been drawn to the theater because they've heard that theater because they've heard that President and Mrs. Lincoln are coming President and Mrs. Lincoln are coming with General and Mrs. Grant. They didn't with General and Mrs. Grant. They didn't show up because they basically hate Mrs. show up because they basically hate Mrs. Lincoln. Or maybe there's a more Lincoln. Or maybe there's a more suspicious reason. Yeah, Tom believes suspicious reason. Yeah, Tom believes they're part of the conspiracy, which is they're part of the conspiracy, which is an unusual view, but um I'm happy to an unusual view, but um I'm happy to indulge it. The Lincoln had arrived half indulge it. The Lincoln had arrived half an hour late. They're in the an hour late. They're in the presidential box decorated with American presidential box decorated with American flags and a portrait of the tax traitor flags and a portrait of the tax traitor George Washington. And Dominic, it's George Washington. And Dominic, it's about 12 ft above the stage, isn't it? about 12 ft above the stage, isn't it? So were you, for instance, to be very So were you, for instance, to be very proficient at leaping, that might be a proficient at leaping, that might be a detail that would interest you. detail that would interest you. &gt;&gt; Might be a temptation, might it? &gt;&gt; Might be a temptation, might it? &gt;&gt; Just setting that up for later in the &gt;&gt; Just setting that up for later in the show. So if you went into the box, you show. So if you went into the box, you would see on your left Abraham Lincoln would see on your left Abraham Lincoln in a rocking chair, then his wife Mary in a rocking chair, then his wife Mary in a smaller chair, and their friend in a smaller chair, and their friend Claraara Harris in an armchair, and Claraara Harris in an armchair, and behind them lounging on the sofa, behind them lounging on the sofa, Claraara Harris's fianceé, Major Claraara Harris's fianceé, Major Wthbone. Now, they have been enjoying Wthbone. Now, they have been enjoying the play a lot. They've been laughing. the play a lot. They've been laughing. People have been watching Lincoln, of People have been watching Lincoln, of course, all the time, and they've seen course, all the time, and they've seen him sort of sometimes, you know, in a him sort of sometimes, you know, in a revery, lost in thought. Not surprising revery, lost in thought. Not surprising given the burdens he has to carry. And given the burdens he has to carry. And could I just ask about Mrs. Lincoln? I could I just ask about Mrs. Lincoln? I mean, aside from the murder of her mean, aside from the murder of her husband, does she enjoy the play? I husband, does she enjoy the play? I think she did enjoy the play. People think she did enjoy the play. People said they they noticed her smiling a said they they noticed her smiling a great deal. And this is unusual from her great deal. And this is unusual from her because usually, as we discussed last because usually, as we discussed last time, she's something of a spitfire, time, she's something of a spitfire, always heranging the wives of generals always heranging the wives of generals and stuff and having tantrums and and stuff and having tantrums and storming off. So, she doesn't do any of storming off. So, she doesn't do any of that on this occasion, which is nice. that on this occasion, which is nice. So, it's a lovely evening out for her, I So, it's a lovely evening out for her, I think, up to a certain point. Twice think, up to a certain point. Twice Lincoln is interrupted by messages Lincoln is interrupted by messages during the play and these are brought by during the play and these are brought by a White House messenger called Charles a White House messenger called Charles Forbes who is sitting outside the Forbes who is sitting outside the entrance to the box but neither of them entrance to the box but neither of them are important enough to draw him away. are important enough to draw him away. So he's carrying on watching. What a So he's carrying on watching. What a shame. Now a lot of the audience are shame. Now a lot of the audience are watching Lincoln the whole time. So on watching Lincoln the whole time. So on the far side of the dress circle there the far side of the dress circle there is a local saloon owner called James is a local saloon owner called James Ferguson. He's a huge Ulyses Srant fan. Ferguson. He's a huge Ulyses Srant fan. He was very excited about the thought of He was very excited about the thought of seeing Grant and was disappointed that seeing Grant and was disappointed that he didn't turn up. But he's been he didn't turn up. But he's been watching Lincoln's box through his watching Lincoln's box through his girlfriend's opera glasses. And so girlfriend's opera glasses. And so whenever Lincoln leans forward to see whenever Lincoln leans forward to see the play, this boat Ferguson can see him the play, this boat Ferguson can see him very clearly. And just after 10:00, very clearly. And just after 10:00, Ferguson notices a man with dark hair Ferguson notices a man with dark hair and a thick mustache, very smartly and a thick mustache, very smartly dressed man holding his hat in his hand dressed man holding his hat in his hand walking along the back of the circle walking along the back of the circle towards the presidential box. And the towards the presidential box. And the man gets to the door of the box and then man gets to the door of the box and then he stops as if he's waiting for he stops as if he's waiting for something. This man is the man you something. This man is the man you ventriloquised so amusingly and that is ventriloquised so amusingly and that is John Wils Booth as we discussed last John Wils Booth as we discussed last time. Born in Maryland, a white time. Born in Maryland, a white supremacist, big fan of slavery, big fan supremacist, big fan of slavery, big fan of the Confederacy, well-known of the Confederacy, well-known Shakespearean actor who has not fought Shakespearean actor who has not fought for the South because he's a massive for the South because he's a massive mummies boy and promised his mother he mummies boy and promised his mother he wouldn't join the army. But also because wouldn't join the army. But also because he's his career has been flourishing. he's his career has been flourishing. &gt;&gt; Yes, his career has been flourishing. &gt;&gt; Yes, his career has been flourishing. successful actor. He has uh been successful actor. He has uh been alarmed, horrified by the news of Lee's alarmed, horrified by the news of Lee's surrender, but he had learned early that surrender, but he had learned early that day that Lincoln would be at the day that Lincoln would be at the theater. We discussed last time he's theater. We discussed last time he's hired a horse, is smuggled a package out hired a horse, is smuggled a package out of the city with Confederate agents, and of the city with Confederate agents, and he has contacted three associates of his he has contacted three associates of his from a long-standing scheme to kidnap from a long-standing scheme to kidnap Lincoln. And these associates were a a Lincoln. And these associates were a a German carriage repairman called George German carriage repairman called George Azeroth, a pharmacist assistant called Azeroth, a pharmacist assistant called David Herald, and a Confederate secret David Herald, and a Confederate secret agent called Lewis Powell. Now, I said agent called Lewis Powell. Now, I said last time that he briefed them about the last time that he briefed them about the plan, but I didn't say what the plan plan, but I didn't say what the plan was. Now is the time to unveil Tom the was. Now is the time to unveil Tom the Conspiracy. The plan is that Azeroth Conspiracy. The plan is that Azeroth will kill Vice President Andrew Johnson will kill Vice President Andrew Johnson and Lewis Powell will kill Secretary of and Lewis Powell will kill Secretary of State William Sewart. In other words, State William Sewart. In other words, their plan is to decapitate the northern their plan is to decapitate the northern leadership. Obviously, they don't think leadership. Obviously, they don't think the Confederates are going to the Confederates are going to miraculously win the war, but maybe this miraculously win the war, but maybe this will result in more favorable terms for will result in more favorable terms for the Confederacy now that the war is the Confederacy now that the war is over. And Dominic, there is no hint that over. And Dominic, there is no hint that this is coming from the Confederate this is coming from the Confederate leadership itself. People have talked a leadership itself. People have talked a lot about this. Some historians think lot about this. Some historians think perhaps there is some greater perhaps there is some greater involvement with the Confederate sort of involvement with the Confederate sort of secret service. secret service. secret service. &gt;&gt; No smoking gun. No, there's never been a &gt;&gt; No smoking gun. No, there's never been a smoking gun. And I think it's very smoking gun. And I think it's very unlikely that Jefferson Davis or the unlikely that Jefferson Davis or the Confederate Absolute High Command would Confederate Absolute High Command would have authorized this actually because I have authorized this actually because I think they know at this point the war is think they know at this point the war is over. So there's nothing in it for them. over. So there's nothing in it for them. Not really. So let's return to that Not really. So let's return to that scene outside the box. The messenger, scene outside the box. The messenger, Charles Forbes, is still there, the Charles Forbes, is still there, the White House messenger. John Wils Booth White House messenger. John Wils Booth arrives at the box and he hands Forbes a arrives at the box and he hands Forbes a card. We don't know what was on the card. We don't know what was on the card, but we do know Booth is of course card, but we do know Booth is of course very well known. So Forbes probably very well known. So Forbes probably assumed that the Lincoln had asked to assumed that the Lincoln had asked to see him or that, you know, a well-known see him or that, you know, a well-known actor arrives at the president's box. actor arrives at the president's box. Let's say, I don't know, Matthew McFaden Let's say, I don't know, Matthew McFaden arrives at Kia Starmmer's box at the arrives at Kia Starmmer's box at the Does Karma have any cultural enthusiasms Does Karma have any cultural enthusiasms at all?

Anyway, um, Charles Forbes allows Right. Anyway, um, Charles Forbes allows Booth to open the outer door. And so now Booth to open the outer door. And so now Booth goes in. He's in this little Booth goes in. He's in this little vestibule outside Lincoln's box. He bars vestibule outside Lincoln's box. He bars the outer door behind him with a piece the outer door behind him with a piece of wood. And then he puts his eye to a of wood. And then he puts his eye to a peepphole into Lincoln's box. Now it's peepphole into Lincoln's box. Now it's often said that he had bored the often said that he had bored the peepphole earlier that day. In fact, peepphole earlier that day. In fact, there is a very very detailed and there is a very very detailed and actually brilliant book on John Wils actually brilliant book on John Wils Booth by Michael Calfman called American Booth by Michael Calfman called American Brutus, one for you, Tom. And in that Brutus, one for you, Tom. And in that book, Calfman quotes the son of the book, Calfman quotes the son of the theater manager Harry Ford who wrote in theater manager Harry Ford who wrote in 1962 that Booth had nothing to do with 1962 that Booth had nothing to do with this peepphole. It was always there that this peepphole. It was always there that the theater manager had bored it himself the theater manager had bored it himself so that bodyguards, if they were there, so that bodyguards, if they were there, could see into the presidential box and could see into the presidential box and that Lincoln's entourage could see what that Lincoln's entourage could see what he was up to. Anyway, Booth looks he was up to. Anyway, Booth looks through this hole and you can see there through this hole and you can see there are four people in the box. There's are four people in the box. There's Lincoln the rocking chair. There's Mary. Lincoln the rocking chair. There's Mary. There's Clara Harris. There's Major There's Clara Harris. There's Major Wthbone on this sofa. And now Booth Wthbone on this sofa. And now Booth waits. He doesn't go in. He has thought waits. He doesn't go in. He has thought about this quite carefully. He has an about this quite carefully. He has an escape plan. and he knows the moment he escape plan. and he knows the moment he wants to strike because he's an actor. wants to strike because he's an actor. He knows this play very well. He knows He knows this play very well. He knows there will be a perfect moment when there will be a perfect moment when there's going to be a great punchline. there's going to be a great punchline. The stage will be almost deserted. The stage will be almost deserted. Everybody will be laughing and he can Everybody will be laughing and he can make his move. And this is the hilarious make his move. And this is the hilarious stretch of dialogue that you rendered in stretch of dialogue that you rendered in the previous episode, but it's so funny the previous episode, but it's so funny that I think we should hear it again. that I think we should hear it again. &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. So, it's 10:15. We're act &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. So, it's 10:15. We're act three, scene two, and Harry Hawk. Maybe three, scene two, and Harry Hawk. Maybe Tom, you'd like to do Harry Hawk and Tom, you'd like to do Harry Hawk and I'll play Mrs. Mount Chessington. So I'll play Mrs. Mount Chessington. So Harry Hawk is playing the American Harry Hawk is playing the American cousin and he's arguing with this woman cousin and he's arguing with this woman called Mrs. Mount Chessington. So Lady called Mrs. Mount Chessington. So Lady Braracknel figure. And she storms off Braracknel figure. And she storms off the stage and she says, "I am aware, Mr. the stage and she says, "I am aware, Mr. Trenchard, you are not used to the Trenchard, you are not used to the manners of good society." Don't know the manners of good society." Don't know the manners of good society, eh? Well, I manners of good society, eh? Well, I guess you know enough to turn you inside guess you know enough to turn you inside out, old girl. You suck dollarizing old out, old girl. You suck dollarizing old men trap you. And everybody roars with men trap you. And everybody roars with laughter at this absolutely tremendous laughter at this absolutely tremendous repartee as they would. And it is at repartee as they would. And it is at that moment, Tom, that John Wils booth. that moment, Tom, that John Wils booth. He opens the door of the box. He takes He opens the door of the box. He takes out a Daringer pistol from his pocket. out a Daringer pistol from his pocket. He takes a single step towards Abraham He takes a single step towards Abraham Lincoln's rocking chair. He levels it at Lincoln's rocking chair. He levels it at the back of Lincoln's head and he fires. the back of Lincoln's head and he fires. Point blank range. Point blank range. Point blank range. Now, as soon as the shot rings out, Now, as soon as the shot rings out, Major Wthbone leaps to his feet. He Major Wthbone leaps to his feet. He suddenly realizes what's happening. suddenly realizes what's happening. There's a dark figure in the box. He There's a dark figure in the box. He lunges towards the figure and then he lunges towards the figure and then he shrinks back because he sees the glint shrinks back because he sees the glint of a knife in Booth's other hand. And of a knife in Booth's other hand. And Booth, so he's fired with one hand, and Booth, so he's fired with one hand, and then with the other hand, he strikes then with the other hand, he strikes with a dagger into Wthbone's arm and he with a dagger into Wthbone's arm and he slices through his arm. Wthbone falls slices through his arm. Wthbone falls backwards towards the sofa. This is all backwards towards the sofa. This is all in a second. The two women are so in a second. The two women are so stunned. They're obviously deafened by stunned. They're obviously deafened by the shot and just amazed. They have not the shot and just amazed. They have not really reacted. So, this is when Booth really reacted. So, this is when Booth pulls off the really sort of remarkable pulls off the really sort of remarkable bit of his plan. He strides past them to bit of his plan. He strides past them to the rail of the box. He puts one hand on the rail of the box. He puts one hand on the rail and then he vaults over the the rail and then he vaults over the rail down 12 ft and lands on the stage. rail down 12 ft and lands on the stage. Now, it's often said that he caught a Now, it's often said that he caught a spur in his boot on one of the flags spur in his boot on one of the flags decorating the box. Actually, only one decorating the box. Actually, only one witness, this bloke that I mentioned witness, this bloke that I mentioned earlier with the opera glasses, James earlier with the opera glasses, James Ferguson. He's the only person who said Ferguson. He's the only person who said he saw this happen. Nobody else said he saw this happen. Nobody else said they saw it. Does he hurt himself at they saw it. Does he hurt himself at all? Yes. So, he definitely does. Some all? Yes. So, he definitely does. Some accounts say because he did this, caught accounts say because he did this, caught his spur, he then fell very awkwardly his spur, he then fell very awkwardly onto the stage. I think if he'd caught onto the stage. I think if he'd caught your spur, you'd fall much more your spur, you'd fall much more awkwardly than he falls. I think he awkwardly than he falls. I think he falls, he lands slightly awkwardly. It's falls, he lands slightly awkwardly. It's quite a big drop and he effectively quite a big drop and he effectively fractures his leg as we will discover. fractures his leg as we will discover. But the interesting thing is at this But the interesting thing is at this point there are many many accounts of point there are many many accounts of what happened from witnesses at the what happened from witnesses at the time. None of them tell the same thing. time. None of them tell the same thing. So for people who listen to our JFK So for people who listen to our JFK series who you know were struck by the series who you know were struck by the discrepancies in the eyewitness discrepancies in the eyewitness accounts. This is exactly the same thing accounts. This is exactly the same thing as it is so often in history. You as it is so often in history. You there's nothing unique about the Kennedy there's nothing unique about the Kennedy murder. People didn't even agree on what murder. People didn't even agree on what Booth said. Harry Hawk, the actor who Booth said. Harry Hawk, the actor who was just about to walk off stage, he was was just about to walk off stage, he was convinced that as Booth was preparing to convinced that as Booth was preparing to jump, he shouted the words sick sea jump, he shouted the words sick sea tyrannis. Hawk said then he jumped onto tyrannis. Hawk said then he jumped onto the stage. He straightened up. He raised the stage. He straightened up. He raised his dagger over his head and he shouted, his dagger over his head and he shouted, "The South shall be free." But other "The South shall be free." But other witnesses said, "No, that's not right at witnesses said, "No, that's not right at all." He only shouted, "Six Sea all." He only shouted, "Six Sea Tyrannis, so always to tyrants." once Tyrannis, so always to tyrants." once he'd landed on the stage. And other he'd landed on the stage. And other people said, "Well, no, he didn't say people said, "Well, no, he didn't say that at all. He said the South should be that at all. He said the South should be avenged." Or some people just said, he avenged." Or some people just said, he said, "I've done it and then ran off the said, "I've done it and then ran off the stage." So, you know, if you read a stage." So, you know, if you read a definitive account, you know, you paid definitive account, you know, you paid your money and takes your choice really. your money and takes your choice really. There's no reason to trust one version There's no reason to trust one version rather than another. I suppose the one rather than another. I suppose the one big difference with the Kennedy big difference with the Kennedy assassination is that if he shot Lincoln assassination is that if he shot Lincoln at point blank range, there's no at point blank range, there's no question about who did it and where the question about who did it and where the bullet came from. bullet came from. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Not at all. The only thing that &gt;&gt; Exactly. Not at all. The only thing that everybody agrees, everyone really agrees everybody agrees, everyone really agrees is that once he's landed on the stage is that once he's landed on the stage and said whatever he said, he turned, he and said whatever he said, he turned, he ran into the wings into the darkness and ran into the wings into the darkness and he vanished from sight. he vanished from sight. &gt;&gt; So he ran but he's fractured his leg &gt;&gt; So he ran but he's fractured his leg perhaps or so he's fired by adrenaline perhaps or so he's fired by adrenaline or or or &gt;&gt; fired by adrenaline I think because you &gt;&gt; fired by adrenaline I think because you as you'll find out he doesn't just run as you'll find out he doesn't just run he then rides for hours. So we'll pick he then rides for hours. So we'll pick up when John Wils Booth's story in the up when John Wils Booth's story in the second half but for now let's stay in second half but for now let's stay in the theater. Most people's reaction is the theater. Most people's reaction is total shock and confusion. Now, at total shock and confusion. Now, at first, most people thought it was part first, most people thought it was part of the play or they thought it was a of the play or they thought it was a slightly slightly slightly slightly tasteless stunt to mark Abraham slightly tasteless stunt to mark Abraham Lincoln's presence. Or a lot of people Lincoln's presence. Or a lot of people actually said, "I thought something had actually said, "I thought something had fallen over at the back. I heard a big fallen over at the back. I heard a big bang and I thought something like fallen bang and I thought something like fallen over in the auditorium, had a bit of the over in the auditorium, had a bit of the stage fallen over, you know, who knows stage fallen over, you know, who knows what it was." The theater staff who have what it was." The theater staff who have been half watching through kind of been half watching through kind of windows and things, they were stunned windows and things, they were stunned when they saw Booth of all people on when they saw Booth of all people on stage.

He's had his arm chopped off, hasn't he? Basically, it's a big slice hasn't he? Basically, it's a big slice down his arm and there's blood soaking down his arm and there's blood soaking into his sleeve. Now, even though he's into his sleeve. Now, even though he's losing a lot of blood, he has the losing a lot of blood, he has the presence of mind to try and open the presence of mind to try and open the door of the box and he realizes that door of the box and he realizes that Booth has jammed it. So, there are other Booth has jammed it. So, there are other people hammering on the door. So, people hammering on the door. So, between them, they managed to get the between them, they managed to get the door open and people burst into the box. door open and people burst into the box. Now, one of them is a young doctor who's Now, one of them is a young doctor who's only been qualified for a few weeks, I only been qualified for a few weeks, I think, called Charles Le. He's in his think, called Charles Le. He's in his 20ies, and he's joined by an older 20ies, and he's joined by an older doctor from the army, a signal core doctor from the army, a signal core surgeon called Charles Taft. surgeon called Charles Taft. Le the younger man is the first to Le the younger man is the first to Lincoln's body. And he finds the Lincoln's body. And he finds the president. He's comeos unconscious. He's president. He's comeos unconscious. He's breathing, very labored breathing. And breathing, very labored breathing. And interestingly, although it's point blank interestingly, although it's point blank range, Le can't actually find the wound range, Le can't actually find the wound at first because it's only a small at first because it's only a small pistol. And at first, because everybody pistol. And at first, because everybody had seen Booth lifting, waving this had seen Booth lifting, waving this bloody knife on stage, they assumed that bloody knife on stage, they assumed that Lincoln has been stabbed. And it's Lincoln has been stabbed. And it's interesting that, isn't it? I'd never interesting that, isn't it? I'd never thought that. But of course, Caesar had thought that. But of course, Caesar had been murdered with a dagger. been murdered with a dagger. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So for a Shakespeare actor to stand on a &gt;&gt; So for a Shakespeare actor to stand on a stage and wave a dagger is much more stage and wave a dagger is much more natural than for him, say to wave a gun. natural than for him, say to wave a gun. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess so. I hadn't &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess so. I hadn't thought that actually that that's the thought that actually that that's the thing that he waves. thing that he waves. &gt;&gt; The seiotics of it is much more &gt;&gt; The seiotics of it is much more Shakespearean. Shakespearean. Shakespearean. &gt;&gt; It is. Absolutely. It is much more &gt;&gt; It is. Absolutely. It is much more classical. So with some soldiers, Leel classical. So with some soldiers, Leel gets Lincoln to the floor. They still gets Lincoln to the floor. They still can't find the wound. They're cutting can't find the wound. They're cutting off his shirt, assuming he's been off his shirt, assuming he's been stabbed. And then Leo runs his hand stabbed. And then Leo runs his hand through Lincoln's hair and he finds a through Lincoln's hair and he finds a bullet hole at the back of his head. bullet hole at the back of his head. Well, a small bullet hole with a Well, a small bullet hole with a swelling around it. And the blood's swelling around it. And the blood's already started to clot. And as Leel already started to clot. And as Leel ruffles through kind of Lincoln's hair, ruffles through kind of Lincoln's hair, the clot opens up and blood pours out. the clot opens up and blood pours out. But at that point, Lincoln starts to But at that point, Lincoln starts to breathe more easily. Now, at this point, breathe more easily. Now, at this point, the soldiers are already saying, "We've the soldiers are already saying, "We've got to get the president back to the got to get the president back to the White House." And the surgeon, the army White House." And the surgeon, the army surgeon, Dr. Taft, steps in. He says, surgeon, Dr. Taft, steps in. He says, "Listen, I know what I'm talking about. "Listen, I know what I'm talking about. We cannot take him there. You can't move We cannot take him there. You can't move him a long way. Where we should take him him a long way. Where we should take him is the nearest house." is the nearest house." &gt;&gt; And they want to do this because they &gt;&gt; And they want to do this because they feel it would be vulgar for a president feel it would be vulgar for a president to die in a theater. They already know to die in a theater. They already know he's he's basically dead. he's he's basically dead. &gt;&gt; This is so interesting. And this is &gt;&gt; This is so interesting. And this is Michael Calfman's theory because Calfman Michael Calfman's theory because Calfman points out at this point, just to be points out at this point, just to be clear, both of these doctors are in no clear, both of these doctors are in no doubt whatsoever that Lincoln is a dead doubt whatsoever that Lincoln is a dead man. There is no way if you've been shot man. There is no way if you've been shot in the back of the head, a point blank in the back of the head, a point blank range that you will possibly survive. So range that you will possibly survive. So they know he's dying, but they don't they know he's dying, but they don't want him to die on Good Friday in a want him to die on Good Friday in a playhouse. It's so indecorous playhouse. It's so indecorous is the word. Yeah. So they organize a is the word. Yeah. So they organize a bearer party and they take Lincoln out bearer party and they take Lincoln out of the box down the stairs through the of the box down the stairs through the sort of foyer and across the road to the sort of foyer and across the road to the nearest house which is a lodging house nearest house which is a lodging house ironically obviously because it's close ironically obviously because it's close to the theater very popular with actors to the theater very popular with actors run by a German tor called William run by a German tor called William Peterson and they take him to a back Peterson and they take him to a back bedroom on the ground floor and Lincoln bedroom on the ground floor and Lincoln is such a long man very tall man that he is such a long man very tall man that he won't fit on a bed so they have to lie won't fit on a bed so they have to lie him kind of diagonally across the bed. him kind of diagonally across the bed. Now, Mary Lincoln kind of trails behind Now, Mary Lincoln kind of trails behind them. She's in a total days, not them. She's in a total days, not surprisingly, in a state of shock. So surprisingly, in a state of shock. So are Claraara Harris and this poor bloke, are Claraara Harris and this poor bloke, Major Wthbone, who's basically comes Major Wthbone, who's basically comes very close to death cuz Booth had very close to death cuz Booth had actually severed an artery and his his actually severed an artery and his his arm being patched up by this point. arm being patched up by this point. &gt;&gt; His arm is eventually patched up. But &gt;&gt; His arm is eventually patched up. But actually, Mary Lincoln actually, Mary Lincoln could never look at Claraara and Major could never look at Claraara and Major Wthbone again. I think she associated Wthbone again. I think she associated them with that knight. Anyway, them with that knight. Anyway, the soldiers eventually get Mary Lincoln the soldiers eventually get Mary Lincoln across the street and for a time she across the street and for a time she just stands on her own in the front just stands on her own in the front parlor kind of just standing in shock. I parlor kind of just standing in shock. I feel really sorry for her. She's lost feel really sorry for her. She's lost her son. Now she's lost her husband and her son.

There absolutely was a conspiracy in this case and we don't a conspiracy in this case and we don't need to put more people in it because we need to put more people in it because we know who was in it. know who was in it. &gt;&gt; It's kind of more fun to do that, isn't &gt;&gt; It's kind of more fun to do that, isn't it? it? it? &gt;&gt; I suppose it is. I mean, to pile people &gt;&gt; I suppose it is. I mean, to pile people into it, but just to deal with the into it, but just to deal with the conspiracy that actually existed. conspiracy that actually existed. &gt;&gt; So, the others definitely didn't exist. &gt;&gt; So, the others definitely didn't exist. &gt;&gt; No, I don't think they did. I think the &gt;&gt; No, I don't think they did. I think the one possibility is that there were more one possibility is that there were more people who knew about it in the sort of people who knew about it in the sort of &gt;&gt; Confederacy. &gt;&gt; Confederacy. &gt;&gt; Confederacy. &gt;&gt; In the Confederacy &gt;&gt; In the Confederacy &gt;&gt; because there is a link to kind of the &gt;&gt; because there is a link to kind of the Confederate Secret Service in Confederate Secret Service in Washington, isn't there? There's a sort Washington, isn't there? There's a sort of underworld of Confederate of underworld of Confederate sympathizers and agents and as we will sympathizers and agents and as we will see they do help the conspirators. see they do help the conspirators. &gt;&gt; So definitely there is a little network. &gt;&gt; So definitely there is a little network. How far it goes is hard to say. How far it goes is hard to say. &gt;&gt; The plan as I've said was to decapitate &gt;&gt; The plan as I've said was to decapitate the American government. the American government. &gt;&gt; Now it didn't work out quite as John &gt;&gt; Now it didn't work out quite as John Wils Booth had hoped. So one bloke Wils Booth had hoped. So one bloke George Azeroth who was the German repair George Azeroth who was the German repair man. He was supposed to kill Vice man. He was supposed to kill Vice President Johnson. He went to Johnson's President Johnson. He went to Johnson's hotel. He thought he'd have a quick hotel. He thought he'd have a quick drink to stiffen his nerves and then he drink to stiffen his nerves and then he just thought, "Actually, sort it. I'll just thought, "Actually, sort it. I'll just stay in the bar." He completely just stay in the bar." He completely loses his nerve. He just spends the loses his nerve. He just spends the evening drinking in the bar and then he evening drinking in the bar and then he wanders the streets. He tries to throw wanders the streets. He tries to throw his knife away. He's spotted by a woman his knife away. He's spotted by a woman throwing a knife down the drain or throwing a knife down the drain or something. And a few days later, he's something. And a few days later, he's arrested. Now, the other bit of the arrested. Now, the other bit of the conspiracy was much more successful. conspiracy was much more successful.

Dealt with very softly. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Dealt with very softly. Right. Well, John Wils Booth is not hanged Well, John Wils Booth is not hanged unlike this woman. So what happened to unlike this woman. So what happened to him? As you said earlier, there's him? As you said earlier, there's obviously no doubt that he's Lincoln's obviously no doubt that he's Lincoln's killer. He's shot him in full view of killer. He's shot him in full view of all these people and then jumped onto all these people and then jumped onto the stage. Many of these people actually the stage. Many of these people actually know him by sight. know him by sight. Right away. Therefore, the police are Right away. Therefore, the police are looking for him. They know he almost looking for him. They know he almost certainly would have gone south because certainly would have gone south because any sane person would have tried to any sane person would have tried to cross the PTOAC River into Virginia and cross the PTOAC River into Virginia and then to go south in Virginia and to get then to go south in Virginia and to get past the Union lines into the past the Union lines into the Confederacy. But that's where he Confederacy. But that's where he obviously goes wrong, isn't it? He obviously goes wrong, isn't it?

An astronomical amount of money in those An astronomical amount of money in those days. Let the stain of innocent blood be days. Let the stain of innocent blood be removed from the land by the arrest and removed from the land by the arrest and punishment of the murderers. All this punishment of the murderers. All this kind of thing. But the days go by and kind of thing. But the days go by and there is no sign of him. So what has there is no sign of him. So what has happened to him? Well, we actually know happened to him? Well, we actually know what happened to him. They don't know, what happened to him. They don't know, but we know. When Booth had left the but we know. When Booth had left the stage, he had gone down this unlit stage, he had gone down this unlit passage that led to the back door of the passage that led to the back door of the theater. Of course, he knew the theater theater. Of course, he knew the theater really well, so he knows where he was really well, so he knows where he was going. Now remember I said before that going. Now remember I said before that he had rented this mare and the mayor he had rented this mare and the mayor this horse is waiting for him in the this horse is waiting for him in the alley behind the theater. alley behind the theater. &gt;&gt; And Dominic also in the previous episode &gt;&gt; And Dominic also in the previous episode we mentioned how some really top we mentioned how some really top American names will be featuring in the American names will be featuring in the second episode second episode second episode &gt;&gt; and listeners should prepare themselves &gt;&gt; and listeners should prepare themselves for what is to come. for what is to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. booth. Before going to the &gt;&gt; Yeah. booth. Before going to the theater, it approached a stage carpenter theater, it approached a stage carpenter called Ned Spangler and said, "But called Ned Spangler and said, "But there's better. Could you hold my for there's better. Could you hold my for me?" And Spangler said, "All right." And me?" And Spangler said, "All right." And then as soon as Booth was out of sight, then as soon as Booth was out of sight, Spangler didn't want to get rid of this Spangler didn't want to get rid of this horse and he gave the horse to a junior horse and he gave the horse to a junior person at theater called Peanut Borrows. person at theater called Peanut Borrows. So Peanut Boros is now looking after So Peanut Boros is now looking after this horse. Anyway, Booth bursts out of this horse. Anyway, Booth bursts out of the back door of the theater, sort of the back door of the theater, sort of out of the fire exit. The horse is out of the fire exit. The horse is waiting and is startled and tries to waiting and is startled and tries to kind of pull away, but Booth manages to kind of pull away, but Booth manages to kind of clamber into the saddle anyway. kind of clamber into the saddle anyway. And it's a very sort of cinematic And it's a very sort of cinematic moment. Just as the first pursuers are moment. Just as the first pursuers are coming out of the door behind him, he coming out of the door behind him, he spurs the horse and rides off down this spurs the horse and rides off down this alley into the darkness. And he clearly alley into the darkness. And he clearly traveled very quickly because by about traveled very quickly because by about 11:30, he has reached the wooden draw 11:30, he has reached the wooden draw bridge across the Anacostia River, which bridge across the Anacostia River, which is by the US Naval Yard. The bridge was is by the US Naval Yard. The bridge was guarded by Union troops. now under guarded by Union troops. now under wartime regulations because remember one wartime regulations because remember one of the really remarkable things about of the really remarkable things about the American Civil War is that the Union the American Civil War is that the Union capital Washington is effectively a capital Washington is effectively a frontline city. frontline city. frontline city. So because of the wartime regulations So because of the wartime regulations there was a curfew and you couldn't there was a curfew and you couldn't enter or leave the city after 9:00 at enter or leave the city after 9:00 at night. So Booth turns up at 11:40 and a night. So Booth turns up at 11:40 and a guy called Sergeant Silas Cobb is called guy called Sergeant Silas Cobb is called out and told there's a rider trying to out and told there's a rider trying to get across the bridge. And Booth gives get across the bridge. And Booth gives his name. Amy says, "My name is Booth. I his name. Amy says, "My name is Booth. I live in Charles County, Maryland, and I live in Charles County, Maryland, and I want to go across the bridge home." And want to go across the bridge home." And Cobb says, "Um, what about the curfew? Cobb says, "Um, what about the curfew? Do you know about the curfew?" And by Do you know about the curfew?" And by this point, there isn't a kind of this point, there isn't a kind of telegraph or anything, so they haven't telegraph or anything, so they haven't been notified. been notified. been notified. &gt;&gt; No, they haven't been notified. Exactly. &gt;&gt; No, they haven't been notified. Exactly. And Booth says, "Oh, I didn't know about And Booth says, "Oh, I didn't know about the curfew. I haven't been into town for the curfew. I haven't been into town for ages, so I didn't know about it." Now, ages, so I didn't know about it." Now, Sergeant Cobb hesitates. He finds it Sergeant Cobb hesitates. He finds it weird that the horse has been ridden weird that the horse has been ridden very hard. So you were asking could very hard. So you were asking could Booth run with his fractured leg? Not Booth run with his fractured leg? Not only can he run, he can gallop. He has only can he run, he can gallop. He has ridden the horse hard, but he's struck ridden the horse hard, but he's struck by the fact that Booth is very well by the fact that Booth is very well turned out. He actually comments on his turned out. He actually comments on his nicely sort of quafted hair and his nicely sort of quafted hair and his manicured nails, his paded mustache. manicured nails, his paded mustache. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And so Cobb says, "Well, this &gt;&gt; Exactly. And so Cobb says, "Well, this guy's obviously, you know, he wouldn't guy's obviously, you know, he wouldn't lie." And he says, "All right, fine. Go lie." And he says, "All right, fine. Go across, but you have to walk your horse across, but you have to walk your horse across the bridge." Which Booth does. across the bridge." Which Booth does. Few moments later, a second horseman Few moments later, a second horseman arrives. This is Booth's co-conspirator, arrives. This is Booth's co-conspirator, the pharmacist bloke, David Herald. And the pharmacist bloke, David Herald. And he says, "I'm going home to Charles he says, "I'm going home to Charles County," funnily enough, as well, and County," funnily enough, as well, and Cobb at this point thinks, "This is kind Cobb at this point thinks, "This is kind of peculiar." And he says to this bloke, of peculiar." And he says to this bloke, "Well, why didn't you leave earlier?" "Well, why didn't you leave earlier?" And Herold says, "You know, there's been And Herold says, "You know, there's been a lot of parties in the city. I stopped a lot of parties in the city. I stopped to see a woman on Capitol Hill, and I to see a woman on Capitol Hill, and I couldn't get off before." couldn't get off before." And the sergeant thinks, "Actually, do And the sergeant thinks, "Actually, do you know what that is quite plausible? you know what that is quite plausible? You know, everyone's having a party. He You know, everyone's having a party. He might have shacked up with some woman might have shacked up with some woman and you're not going to make it up and and you're not going to make it up and also the war's kind of over. Like who also the war's kind of over. Like who cares? Leah's been beaten so it doesn't cares? Leah's been beaten so it doesn't really matter. And so he lets them go. really matter. And so he lets them go. And so by midnight both of them are And so by midnight both of them are cross the Anacostia River and they're cross the Anacostia River and they're heading into southern Maryland. Now the heading into southern Maryland. Now the first place they head for is the tavern first place they head for is the tavern owned by this Confederate agent or owned by this Confederate agent or suspected Confederate agent Mary Serat. suspected Confederate agent Mary Serat. And it's in the village of Saratzville, And it's in the village of Saratzville, which has, I believe, since been renamed which has, I believe, since been renamed Clinton because they didn't want to name Clinton because they didn't want to name it after Confederate traitors. Now, it after Confederate traitors. Now, remember, Booth had given her a package remember, Booth had given her a package earlier that day. And now he picks it up earlier that day. And now he picks it up from the tavern and it contains some from the tavern and it contains some binoculars and two carbines, rifles. binoculars and two carbines, rifles. This is very Lee Harvey old, isn't it? This is very Lee Harvey old, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. People always carrying &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.

They love it. ridiculous names and like brown paper ridiculous names and like brown paper packages that could be rifles. packages that could be rifles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, the thing about Booth's leg, his &gt;&gt; Now, the thing about Booth's leg, his leg is now causing him in great pain. leg is now causing him in great pain. And about 4:00 in the morning, he goes And about 4:00 in the morning, he goes to corn on a local doctor called Samuel to corn on a local doctor called Samuel Mud. Of course, he is. Who's a a keen Mud. Of course, he is. Who's a a keen Confederate supporter and was part of Confederate supporter and was part of his kidnapping scheme. And Mud says, "Oh his kidnapping scheme. And Mud says, "Oh my goodness, you fractured your calf my goodness, you fractured your calf bone." and he makes a splint and he gets bone." and he makes a splint and he gets him some crutches and he says, "You two him some crutches and he says, "You two like Booth and Herald can sleep in my like Booth and Herald can sleep in my house." Then on the next day, a house." Then on the next day, a Saturday, Mud gets up and he goes and Saturday, Mud gets up and he goes and does some errands and he hears in the does some errands and he hears in the town or the village Abraham Lincoln has town or the village Abraham Lincoln has been murdered and he obviously puts two been murdered and he obviously puts two and two together. He comes back to the and two together. He comes back to the house and he says, "You guys have got to house and he says, "You guys have got to go. Like, I can't have you here any go. Like, I can't have you here any longer." They set off through the longer." They set off through the countryside. Remember that Booth is kind countryside. Remember that Booth is kind of limping. is on crutches part of the of limping. is on crutches part of the time time time &gt;&gt; and he's still got his opera cloak on &gt;&gt; and he's still got his opera cloak on and and and &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. still dressed as the Phantom &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. still dressed as the Phantom of the Opera. They get they get lost in a swamp and They get they get lost in a swamp and they end up having to beg, ironically, a they end up having to beg, ironically, a freed black man called Oswald Swan to freed black man called Oswald Swan to help them and guide them through this help them and guide them through this swamp. And they pay him $12 to guide swamp. And they pay him $12 to guide them to a plantation house owned by them to a plantation house owned by another Confederate bloke that they another Confederate bloke that they know. And there, this bloke who owns the know. And there, this bloke who owns the plantation gets his overseer to take plantation gets his overseer to take them to a pine thicket in the swamp. Has them to a pine thicket in the swamp. Has there been a film about this? Surely. I there been a film about this? Surely. I think there's been a series, a Netflix think there's been a series, a Netflix series or something of that kind. I must series or something of that kind. I must watch it. I bet there should clearly be watch it. I bet there should clearly be another one, a better one, because this another one, a better one, because this is a great story. So, um, they hide in is a great story. So, um, they hide in this pine thicket and basically their this pine thicket and basically their friends and Confederate agents are friends and Confederate agents are trying to figure out how to get them trying to figure out how to get them across the Ptoic River into Virginia. across the Ptoic River into Virginia. So, they wait in this thicket for about So, they wait in this thicket for about four days and nights, I think. four days and nights, I think. and a local Confederate agent called and a local Confederate agent called Thomas Jones pitches up every now and Thomas Jones pitches up every now and again with food and in particular with again with food and in particular with newspapers. So Booth has not been able newspapers. So Booth has not been able to, you know, like any good actor, he's to, you know, like any good actor, he's obsessed with his reviews. He wants to obsessed with his reviews. He wants to read what people have written about him read what people have written about him in the papers and he had written a in the papers and he had written a letter to the newspapers explaining his letter to the newspapers explaining his reasons that he was the American Brutus reasons that he was the American Brutus and he's absolutely furious that they and he's absolutely furious that they haven't printed it. They haven't given haven't printed it. They haven't given him the the airtime as it were. And it's him the the airtime as it were. And it's at this point that he writes his first at this point that he writes his first journal entry. So this is not the one journal entry. So this is not the one that you read. It's an earlier one. And that you read. It's an earlier one. And he explains, you know, why he did what he explains, you know, why he did what he did. He said, "Our cause being lost, he did. He said, "Our cause being lost, something decisive and great must be something decisive and great must be done. But its failure was owing to done. But its failure was owing to others who did not strike for their others who did not strike for their country with a heart. I struck boldly country with a heart. I struck boldly and not as the papers say." So he's and not as the papers say." So he's already defending himself against the already defending himself against the critics. I walked with a firm step critics. I walked with a firm step through a thousand of his friends. Now, through a thousand of his friends. Now, here's an interesting thing. I shouted here's an interesting thing. I shouted six seer before I fired, six seer before I fired, not afterwards. Every other account says not afterwards. Every other account says he shouted six seers. I ran after he he shouted six seers. I ran after he fired. fired. fired. &gt;&gt; So, do you think his memor is playing &gt;&gt; So, do you think his memor is playing tricks on him or tricks on him or &gt;&gt; possibly his memory is playing tricks on &gt;&gt; possibly his memory is playing tricks on him? Yeah, exactly. In jumping, I broke him? Yeah, exactly. In jumping, I broke my leg. I passed all his pickets. I rode my leg. I passed all his pickets. I rode 60 mi that night with the bone of my leg 60 mi that night with the bone of my leg tearing the flesh at every jump. I can tearing the flesh at every jump. I can never repent it. Our country owed all never repent it. Our country owed all her trouble to him, and God simply made her trouble to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment. me the instrument of his punishment. There is a definite air of sort of There is a definite air of sort of hysteria, I think, about this entry. You hysteria, I think, about this entry. You know, he's not he's not thinking know, he's not he's not thinking terribly clearly. I think it's fair to terribly clearly. I think it's fair to say. Thursday the 20th, Thomas Jones, say. Thursday the 20th, Thomas Jones, the Confederate agent, his reports that the Confederate agent, his reports that Union troops are now scouring the woods Union troops are now scouring the woods in a nearby county. And he tells them in a nearby county. And he tells them they have to move. They have to go they have to move. They have to go across the river. He's got a fishing across the river. He's got a fishing boat down on the PTOAC. And he pushes boat down on the PTOAC. And he pushes them off into the night on this fishing them off into the night on this fishing boat. It's very foggy. The PTOIC at this boat. It's very foggy. The PTOIC at this point is very wide and they get point is very wide and they get completely lost. They row all night and completely lost. They row all night and then they land and then when day comes then they land and then when day comes they realize they're basically back they realize they're basically back where they started but further away and where they started but further away and they're still on the wrong side of the they're still on the wrong side of the river. So the next night, Friday the river. So the next night, Friday the 21st, Saturday the 22nd, they have 21st, Saturday the 22nd, they have another go and they manage to row across another go and they manage to row across this time and they land, of course they this time and they land, of course they land somewhere called Gambo Creek in land somewhere called Gambo Creek in Virginia. Virginia. Virginia. In the meantime, this is when Booth has In the meantime, this is when Booth has written that second journal entry that written that second journal entry that you read so splendidly. So the tone you read so splendidly. So the tone here, I think you you did it in a very here, I think you you did it in a very brilliant uh style, brilliant uh style, &gt;&gt; right? Blessed style. &gt;&gt; right? Blessed style. &gt;&gt; I think it's fair to say, but actually I &gt;&gt; I think it's fair to say, but actually I think he's very berraggled and miserable think he's very berraggled and miserable at this point. at this point. &gt;&gt; Oh, all this stuff about being hunted by &gt;&gt; Oh, all this stuff about being hunted by like a dog and all this. like a dog and all this. &gt;&gt; So I didn't think through what his &gt;&gt; So I didn't think through what his motivation was. motivation was. motivation was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it wasn't method acting. &gt;&gt; Oh, it wasn't method acting. &gt;&gt; No, Daniel D.

I'm abandoned with a curse of himself. I'm abandoned with a curse of Cain upon me when if the world knew my Cain upon me when if the world knew my heart, that one blow would have made me heart, that one blow would have made me great, though I did desire no greatness. great, though I did desire no greatness. And then he says, "I have too great a And then he says, "I have too great a soul to die like a criminal." He thinks soul to die like a criminal." He thinks a lot of himself. I think it's fair to a lot of himself. I think it's fair to say he does. So for two days they say he does. So for two days they continue south and on the Sunday night, continue south and on the Sunday night, the 23rd, he lets himself down. Behaves the 23rd, he lets himself down. Behaves very poorly. What do you mean he lets very poorly. What do you mean he lets himself down? He's just shot Abraham himself down? He's just shot Abraham Lincoln. Of course he's let himself Lincoln. Of course he's let himself down. down. down. &gt;&gt; I think worse of him for this, actually. &gt;&gt; I think worse of him for this, actually. I think worse of him for this because he I think worse of him for this because he he arrives at the cabin of a freed black he arrives at the cabin of a freed black family called the Lucas'es and he and family called the Lucas'es and he and Herold threaten the father William Lucas Herold threaten the father William Lucas at knife point and drive the whole at knife point and drive the whole family into the woods so they can sleep family into the woods so they can sleep in their cabin. in their cabin. &gt;&gt; That is poor. &gt;&gt; That is poor. &gt;&gt; It is poor. &gt;&gt; It is poor. &gt;&gt; But I mean at least he doesn't kill &gt;&gt; But I mean at least he doesn't kill William Lucas. I agree he's not coming William Lucas. I agree he's not coming across well from this. across well from this. &gt;&gt; It reflects really badly on him. &gt;&gt; It reflects really badly on him. Reflects really bad. Reflects really bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I said that. The next day, Monday &gt;&gt; Yeah, I said that. The next day, Monday the 24th, he and Herald meet three the 24th, he and Herald meet three Confederate soldiers who lead them to a Confederate soldiers who lead them to a tobacco farm, inevitably called Locust tobacco farm, inevitably called Locust Hill. &gt;&gt; This is the world's most American story. &gt;&gt; This is the world's most American story. &gt;&gt; It is Locust Hill. And it's owned by a &gt;&gt; It is Locust Hill. And it's owned by a man who actually has a reasonable name, man who actually has a reasonable name, Richard Garrett. Richard Garrett. Richard Garrett. &gt;&gt; That's disappointing. &gt;&gt; That's disappointing. &gt;&gt; Booth says, "I'm a wounded Confederate &gt;&gt; Booth says, "I'm a wounded Confederate soldier." And Garrett says, "Fine, you soldier." And Garrett says, "Fine, you can stay." Herald actually goes off with can stay." Herald actually goes off with these other Confederate soldiers into these other Confederate soldiers into the nearby town, which is called Bowling the nearby town, which is called Bowling Green. So Garrett doesn't say, "If Green. So Garrett doesn't say, "If you're a Confederate soldier, why are you're a Confederate soldier, why are you wearing evening dress?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why are you dressed like the &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why are you dressed like the Phantom of the Opera? No, he doesn't. Phantom of the Opera? No, he doesn't. Actually, at first it's lovely sweetness Actually, at first it's lovely sweetness and light. So Booth has a nice rest. He and light. So Booth has a nice rest. He has a nice breakfast and then he plays has a nice breakfast and then he plays with Garrett's children on the lawn. So with Garrett's children on the lawn. So maybe his leg is a bit better. But then maybe his leg is a bit better. But then things start to unravel. Herald and the things start to unravel. Herald and the soldiers come back to the Garrett farm soldiers come back to the Garrett farm to Locust Hill and they say there's to Locust Hill and they say there's Union cavalry in the area. And Booth Union cavalry in the area. And Booth panics and he rushes off to hide in the panics and he rushes off to hide in the woods. And at this point, the Garrett woods. And at this point, the Garrett family become very suspicious. If he's family become very suspicious. If he's just an ordinary Confederate soldier, just an ordinary Confederate soldier, you know, why would he have panicked and you know, why would he have panicked and run away to the woods? The war's kind of run away to the woods? The war's kind of over. You know, there it's very lowrisk over. You know, there it's very lowrisk strange behavior. When he finally strange behavior. When he finally emerges, they say, "Are you really in emerges, they say, "Are you really in the Confederate army?" He says, "Oh, the Confederate army?" He says, "Oh, yeah. I was in," this is where his yeah. I was in," this is where his acting skills come in. He says, "I was acting skills come in. He says, "I was in Captain Robinson's company of the in Captain Robinson's company of the 30th Virginia." But as luck would have 30th Virginia." But as luck would have it, Richard Garrett's son Jack is a it, Richard Garrett's son Jack is a Confederate soldier and he knows that Confederate soldier and he knows that unit and he knows there is no such unit and he knows there is no such captain. So they have a massive argument captain. So they have a massive argument and the Garretts eventually say, "Right, and the Garretts eventually say, "Right, okay, you guys can stay one more night. okay, you guys can stay one more night. We're not going to have you in the We're not going to have you in the house. You can stay in the tobacco house. You can stay in the tobacco barn." barn." barn." But the Garretts now think that these BS But the Garretts now think that these BS are probably horse thieves. So, they are probably horse thieves. So, they lock the barn door once Booth and Herald lock the barn door once Booth and Herald are inside. Now, meanwhile, in the are inside. Now, meanwhile, in the nearby town, nearby town, nearby town, &gt;&gt; what's the nearby town called, Dominic? &gt;&gt; what's the nearby town called, Dominic? &gt;&gt; Bowling Green. &gt;&gt; Bowling Green. &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Officers of the National Detective &gt;&gt; Officers of the National Detective Police and a detachment of the 16th New Police and a detachment of the 16th New York Cavalry have arrived to hunt for York Cavalry have arrived to hunt for the fugitives and they talk to these the fugitives and they talk to these three Confederate soldiers who had three Confederate soldiers who had helped Booth and Herald and basically helped Booth and Herald and basically get the truth out of them. It takes them get the truth out of them. It takes them two hours to ride to Locust Hill Farm two hours to ride to Locust Hill Farm and they arrive at about 2:00 in the and they arrive at about 2:00 in the morning. They surround the house. They morning. They surround the house. They drag the Garretts out of bed and they drag the Garretts out of bed and they basically say to Richard Garrett, "If basically say to Richard Garrett, "If you don't tell us where these guys are, you don't tell us where these guys are, we will hang you right here." Jack we will hang you right here." Jack Garrett, this Confederate soldier who's Garrett, this Confederate soldier who's still wearing his Confederate uniform, still wearing his Confederate uniform, comes out and he says, "Father, just comes out and he says, "Father, just tell them." So, they go to the barn and tell them." So, they go to the barn and the detectives send Jack Garrett to the detectives send Jack Garrett to speak to the fugitives. Say, "Come out. speak to the fugitives. Say, "Come out. They won't come out." Then the chief of They won't come out." Then the chief of the detectives, who's called Luther the detectives, who's called Luther Byron Baker, he shouts into the barn. He Byron Baker, he shouts into the barn. He says, "Surrender. Come out. If you don't says, "Surrender. Come out. If you don't come out, I'll burn this barn down. You come out, I'll burn this barn down. You got 15 minutes." Herold wants to give got 15 minutes." Herold wants to give up. Booth says, "No, no, don't give up. up. Booth says, "No, no, don't give up. Don't give up." Whispering to him. Don't give up." Whispering to him. Luther Byron Baker says, "I'm going to Luther Byron Baker says, "I'm going to start burning this barn down." And Booth start burning this barn down." And Booth shouts back. He says, "Captain, that's shouts back. He says, "Captain, that's rather rough. I'm nothing but a rather rough. I'm nothing but a I have but one leg. You ought to give me I have but one leg. You ought to give me a chance for a fair fight." a chance for a fair fight." And Baker says, "Listen, you got 5 And Baker says, "Listen, you got 5 minutes and I'm going to burn this minutes and I'm going to burn this bloody barn down." Booth is playing for bloody barn down." Booth is playing for time, making all sort of complaints and time, making all sort of complaints and stuff, and eventually they pile stuff, and eventually they pile brushwood against the barn, and one of brushwood against the barn, and one of them sets it a light. At this point, them sets it a light. At this point, Herold panics. He runs to the door. Let Herold panics. He runs to the door. Let me out. He manages to get me out. Let me out. He manages to get out, and the troopers grab him and tie out, and the troopers grab him and tie him up. So now there's just Booth. And him up. So now there's just Booth. And Booth, remember, has a rifle. He has one Booth, remember, has a rifle. He has one of his rifles from the tavern. The fire of his rifles from the tavern. The fire is spreading now across the barn. is spreading now across the barn. Spreads to the rafters. The barn is lit Spreads to the rafters. The barn is lit up with this weird glow and through the up with this weird glow and through the cracks in the timbers, the soldiers can cracks in the timbers, the soldiers can see Booth, as Michael Calfman says in see Booth, as Michael Calfman says in his book, he's trapped like a wild his book, he's trapped like a wild animal, kind of darting around looking animal, kind of darting around looking for a place to escape. And Dominic, it for a place to escape. And Dominic, it is at this point. is at this point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That the moment long-term fans &gt;&gt; That the moment long-term fans &gt;&gt; of the rest of history have been looking &gt;&gt; of the rest of history have been looking forward to. forward to. forward to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it is now that one of history's &gt;&gt; Because it is now that one of history's top 10 Unuks top 10 Unuks &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; makes his appearance in this series. &gt;&gt; makes his appearance in this series.

So, I mean, it's a whole &gt;&gt; He did. So, I mean, it's a whole scissors theme actually in that show scissors theme actually in that show because you remember Charles the 12th of because you remember Charles the 12th of Sweden cut his own foot open with some Sweden cut his own foot open with some scissors. scissors. scissors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But this is much more extreme.

Then he enlisted in the Union Army, Then he enlisted in the Union Army, became a prisoner of war at became a prisoner of war at Andersonville Prison, great sort of Andersonville Prison, great sort of notorious Confederate prison camp. And notorious Confederate prison camp. And then he was exchanged just in time to then he was exchanged just in time to serve in the detachment sent to capture serve in the detachment sent to capture Booth. Booth. Booth. So Boston Corbett is looking through the So Boston Corbett is looking through the cracks in the timbers and he sees Booth cracks in the timbers and he sees Booth raise his rifle and move towards the raise his rifle and move towards the door. Now, almost certainly Booth was door. Now, almost certainly Booth was surrendering, was planning to surrender. surrendering, was planning to surrender. I think the barn is on fire. Boston I think the barn is on fire. Boston Corbett just fired. He fired through the Corbett just fired. He fired through the gaps in the timbers, his revolver, gaps in the timbers, his revolver, and Booth is down. And Dominic, there's and Booth is down.

I mean, write in if there is a &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, write in if there is a conspiracy theory along that line. This conspiracy theory along that line. This is American history. Therefore, there is American history. Therefore, there are almost certainly some mad theories are almost certainly some mad theories out there, I would imagine. Anyway, out there, I would imagine. Anyway, maybe that bloke they carry out is not maybe that bloke they carry out is not John Wils Booth. Maybe the real John John Wils Booth. Maybe the real John Wils is somewhere else. Who knows? Wils is somewhere else. Who knows? Anyway, they carry him out. Boston Anyway, they carry him out. Boston Corbett shot him in the neck. The bullet Corbett shot him in the neck. The bullet went through his neck and through his went through his neck and through his spinal column. So, he's dying. One of spinal column. So, he's dying. One of the detectives who has the excellent the detectives who has the excellent name Everton Conger. Everton. Oh, what is it with these names? Oh, what is it with these names? &gt;&gt; There's a unicorn with the name of &gt;&gt; There's a unicorn with the name of Conger. Boston Corb and Everton Conger. There's Boston Corb and Everton Conger. There's far too many surnames in those names. far too many surnames in those names. That's four people. They could be a That's four people. They could be a crime fighting duo. crime fighting duo. The Uniconga solving crimes in reconstruction solving crimes in reconstruction America. America. America. &gt;&gt; Okay. Everton Conger kneels over him. &gt;&gt; Okay. Everton Conger kneels over him. And the booth whispers, "Tell my mother And the booth whispers, "Tell my mother that I did it for my country. Tell my that I did it for my country. Tell my mother that I die for my country." So mother that I die for my country." So he's a mummies boy right to the end. And he's a mummies boy right to the end. And it took hours for him to die. it took hours for him to die. He kept repeating that line about his He kept repeating that line about his mother in his country. But then as dawn mother in his country. But then as dawn breaks again, perfect for a Hollywood breaks again, perfect for a Hollywood cinematographer. As dawn breaks, he cinematographer. As dawn breaks, he whispers, "Useless, useless." And then whispers, "Useless, useless." And then he dies. That's the end of John Wilks. he dies. That's the end of John Wilks. Now the thing is his story is so rich. Now the thing is his story is so rich. Actually this book that I mentioned by Actually this book that I mentioned by Michael Calfman American Brutus is Michael Calfman American Brutus is brilliant. He thinks the key to Booth is brilliant. He thinks the key to Booth is that he was an actor that basically he that he was an actor that basically he lived in a world of makebelieve that his lived in a world of makebelieve that his identity as a southern gentleman was a identity as a southern gentleman was a complete fiction. He'd never lived in complete fiction. He'd never lived in the south proper that he came from a the south proper that he came from a border state. He'd never had a great border state. He'd never had a great success in the south. All his success success in the south. All his success was in the north. So he's basically a was in the north. So he's basically a Yankee. Yankee. Yankee. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he's invented this fantasy &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he's invented this fantasy life for himself. And as Calfman says, life for himself. And as Calfman says, he constructed a dramatic persona for he constructed a dramatic persona for himself rather than accept the truth himself rather than accept the truth that he was a hot-headed loser who only that he was a hot-headed loser who only talked while others gave their lives. talked while others gave their lives. His title is American Brutus. And of His title is American Brutus. And of course, the great irony is that John course, the great irony is that John Wils Booth dreamt of being Brutus. But Wils Booth dreamt of being Brutus. But it never occurred to him that Brutus was it never occurred to him that Brutus was a failure. a failure. a failure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That Brutus turned Caesar into a martyr &gt;&gt; That Brutus turned Caesar into a martyr and that actually his actions hastened and that actually his actions hastened the end of the Roman Republic. That he the end of the Roman Republic. That he destroyed his own cause. And of course, destroyed his own cause. And of course, that's what John Wils Booth does to some that's what John Wils Booth does to some degree. Now the real question that hangs degree. Now the real question that hangs over all this is which is a shame to be over all this is which is a shame to be asking this question after we've wait asking this question after we've wait spent a lot of time on this show did it spent a lot of time on this show did it matter is it of any importance and of matter is it of any importance and of course a lot of American listeners will course a lot of American listeners will say that it mattered enormously because say that it mattered enormously because as with John F. Kennedy you know with as with John F. Kennedy you know with John F. Kennedy, there is this sort of John F. Kennedy, there is this sort of fantasy if Kennedy lives, you don't get fantasy if Kennedy lives, you don't get Vietnam. You don't get the Vietnam War Vietnam. You don't get the Vietnam War and the sort of darker turn of the and the sort of darker turn of the late60s and Nixon and everything that late60s and Nixon and everything that follows. And the fantasy that's so follows. And the fantasy that's so common with Lincoln's death is Lincoln common with Lincoln's death is Lincoln lives and the South is beaten, but lives and the South is beaten, but Lincoln controls reconstruction. Black Lincoln controls reconstruction. Black Americans are given the vote. The Americans are given the vote. The Confederates never regain control of the Confederates never regain control of the southern states. There is no southern states. There is no segregation. The Jim Crow laws of the segregation. The Jim Crow laws of the 20th century that actually all is 20th century that actually all is sweetness and light. And personally, I sweetness and light. And personally, I find this unbelievably unconvincing and find this unbelievably unconvincing and implausible. I think first of all, implausible. I think first of all, because like the Kennedy sort of because like the Kennedy sort of fantasies, it massively exaggerates the fantasies, it massively exaggerates the power of the presidency. What actually power of the presidency. What actually happens is reconstruction ends up being happens is reconstruction ends up being a huge power struggle between the White a huge power struggle between the White House and Congress, which Congress House and Congress, which Congress actually wins, and Lincoln's successor, actually wins, and Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, ends up being impeached. Andrew Johnson, ends up being impeached. So, there's a real irony there that So, there's a real irony there that Lincoln is murdered for being a tyrant, Lincoln is murdered for being a tyrant, for being a Caesar. for being a Caesar. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's actually the problem &gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's actually the problem that he would have faced is that he's that he would have faced is that he's not nearly autocratic enough. not nearly autocratic enough. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And that actually as soon as &gt;&gt; Exactly. And that actually as soon as the war was over, Congress sort of the war was over, Congress sort of sought to roll back a lot of his what sought to roll back a lot of his what they saw as his more imperial powers. they saw as his more imperial powers. The second thing I think the sort of The second thing I think the sort of fantasy tributes Lincoln with superhuman fantasy tributes Lincoln with superhuman political skills that no human being political skills that no human being ever possessed because Lincoln is a lame ever possessed because Lincoln is a lame duck president and he's already facing duck president and he's already facing massive opposition in Congress. Now, massive opposition in Congress. Now, lots of people expect that from the lots of people expect that from the Democrats who think he's a dictator. But Democrats who think he's a dictator. But the really interesting thing that I the really interesting thing that I think would surprise a lot of listeners think would surprise a lot of listeners is the opposition from radicals in his is the opposition from radicals in his own party. So, this is an extraordinary own party. So, this is an extraordinary thing that when he dies, a lot of the thing that when he dies, a lot of the keenest abolitionists in the Republican keenest abolitionists in the Republican party are actually delighted. party are actually delighted. They held a meeting after his death and They held a meeting after his death and the Indiana congressman George Julian the Indiana congressman George Julian recorded quote the universal feeling recorded quote the universal feeling that his death is a godsend because many that his death is a godsend because many of them think quite wrongly that his of them think quite wrongly that his vice president will do a better job. But vice president will do a better job. But I mean imagine if you'd had um I don't I mean imagine if you'd had um I don't know members of the FBI or the CIA know members of the FBI or the CIA meeting up and saying that Kennedy's meeting up and saying that Kennedy's death was a godsend. Yeah. death was a godsend. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You would suspect a conspiracy. &gt;&gt; You would suspect a conspiracy. &gt;&gt; You think the radical Republicans killed &gt;&gt; You think the radical Republicans killed Abraham Lincoln? Abraham Lincoln? Abraham Lincoln? &gt;&gt; The whole thing is just spiraling out of &gt;&gt; The whole thing is just spiraling out of control here. I mean, actually, if you control here. I mean, actually, if you want evidence, Tom, so Zachariah want evidence, Tom, so Zachariah Chandler, senator from Michigan, God Chandler, senator from Michigan, God continued Mr. Lincoln in office as long continued Mr. Lincoln in office as long as he was useful and then substituted a as he was useful and then substituted a better man to finish the work. Benjamin better man to finish the work. Benjamin Wade, senator from Ohio. By the gods, Wade, senator from Ohio. By the gods, there will be no trouble now in running there will be no trouble now in running the government. Mr. Lincoln had too much the government. Mr. Lincoln had too much of human kindness in him deal with these of human kindness in him deal with these infamous traitors. In other words, the infamous traitors. In other words, the radical Republicans are much less on radical Republicans are much less on Lincoln's team than we often think and Lincoln's team than we often think and they would probably have fallen out with they would probably have fallen out with him in the next few months or years over him in the next few months or years over reconstruction. But the biggest thing reconstruction. But the biggest thing actually the issue of the south and you actually the issue of the south and you know racism, white supremacy, it can't know racism, white supremacy, it can't be fixed by one man because it would be fixed by one man because it would have taken I think a long-term military have taken I think a long-term military regime in the southern states committed regime in the southern states committed to black equality to change things and to black equality to change things and the north was never ever going to accept the north was never ever going to accept such a political and financial such a political and financial commitment. The white south would always commitment. The white south would always have resisted. There would always have have resisted. There would always have been paramilitary groups like the Kuk been paramilitary groups like the Kuk clam and we actually know from Lincoln's clam and we actually know from Lincoln's public statements that's the reason I public statements that's the reason I mentioned them in the first episode. mentioned them in the first episode. He's desperate to get the white south He's desperate to get the white south integrated as quickly as possible to integrated as quickly as possible to return to what he sees as harmony and return to what he sees as harmony and reconciliation. reconciliation. reconciliation. &gt;&gt; So the destiny of the United States as a &gt;&gt; So the destiny of the United States as a continental power even to Lincoln is continental power even to Lincoln is more significant than establishing more significant than establishing racial equality. racial equality. racial equality. &gt;&gt; Yes, I would say so actually. Now I &gt;&gt; Yes, I would say so actually. Now I don't say that to diminish him. He's a don't say that to diminish him. He's a practical politician. He's choosing from practical politician. He's choosing from different priorities. I think he is different priorities. I think he is committed to racial equality but committed to racial equality but gradually and I think he would have gradually and I think he would have found the challenge just as complex and found the challenge just as complex and demanding as his successors did as demanding as his successors did as Ulyses Srant did actually when he became Ulyses Srant did actually when he became president. So in a way you can argue president. So in a way you can argue that as with Kennedy his killer actually that as with Kennedy his killer actually does him a real favor. You know John does him a real favor. You know John Wils Booth turns him into a martyr Wils Booth turns him into a martyr because there's nothing the world likes because there's nothing the world likes more than a kind of slain hero. Right. more than a kind of slain hero. Right. As you implied in the first episode, As you implied in the first episode, there's nothing you enjoy more than an there's nothing you enjoy more than an idol with feet of clay. idol with feet of clay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what we've just been talking about &gt;&gt; But what we've just been talking about in the relation to Lincoln, do you think in the relation to Lincoln, do you think that diminishes him? Does that diminish that diminishes him? Does that diminish his reputation or not? Do you think his reputation or not? Do you think Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln deserves the kind of the reputation that deserves the kind of the reputation that he has not just in America but really he has not just in America but really across the world? Yeah, I think he does across the world? Yeah, I think he does actually. Michael Berlingame in this actually. Michael Berlingame in this book that I've mentioned a few times book that I've mentioned a few times brilliant biography he says Lincoln you brilliant biography he says Lincoln you know had a personality that you very know had a personality that you very rarely find in politics of somebody who rarely find in politics of somebody who is firmly committed to a vision who has is firmly committed to a vision who has the practical pragmatic skills in order the practical pragmatic skills in order to achieve it but is a fully kind of to achieve it but is a fully kind of realized realized realized human being reflective humble human being reflective humble thoughtful with a kind of rise sense of thoughtful with a kind of rise sense of his own place in the grand scheme of his own place in the grand scheme of things you know not without ego of things you know not without ego of course none of us are but He's able to course none of us are but He's able to hold his ego in check. A really hold his ego in check. A really impressive person. I would say impressive person. I would say &gt;&gt; I don't know huge amounts about his life &gt;&gt; I don't know huge amounts about his life but everything that I read about him two but everything that I read about him two things strike me. One is that he has things strike me. One is that he has this incredible ability that all the this incredible ability that all the really great morally profound American really great morally profound American politicians have had. So we did series politicians have had. So we did series on Martin Luther King. Lincoln has this on Martin Luther King. Lincoln has this ability to kind of channel a spirit of ability to kind of channel a spirit of biblical prophecy and associate it with biblical prophecy and associate it with a brighter future for America. a brighter future for America. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But also seems to be fun. &gt;&gt; But also seems to be fun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's an engaging, amusing person. And &gt;&gt; He's an engaging, amusing person. And that combination of biblical prophet and that combination of biblical prophet and somebody who would be fun to be with. somebody who would be fun to be with. You know, they don't always gel. Let's You know, they don't always gel. Let's put it like that. put it like that. &gt;&gt; No, you're absolutely right. And &gt;&gt; No, you're absolutely right. And actually, you mentioned Daniel J.
