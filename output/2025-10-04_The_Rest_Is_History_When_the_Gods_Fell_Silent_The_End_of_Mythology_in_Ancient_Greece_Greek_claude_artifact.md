**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Argonautica and Its Hollywood Parallels

***"Apollonius is basically taking elements from the comic books that people have grown up with and they know and love and reworking them and throwing new things in"***

The Argonautica, written around 250 BC by Apollonius of Rhodes, represents a fundamental shift in how Greek myths were presented and consumed. This epic poem served as the primary source for the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts, featuring special effects by Ray Harryhausen that Tom Hanks once compared favorably to Casablanca and Citizen Kane. The epic includes all the famous elements: Talos the bronze giant, the harpies stealing food from the blind seer Phineas, the clashing rocks, and the skeleton warriors that sprout from dragon's teeth.

Apollonius's work functions as a **prequel to Homer's epics**, featuring baby Achilles and encounters with characters who would later meet Odysseus. The Argonauts sail past the sirens, where Orpheus out-sings them with his lyre rather than having the crew tie themselves to the mast. They meet Circe, who turns out to be Medea's aunt - a genealogical connection that existed in Homer but is exploited for dramatic effect. This approach mirrors modern franchise filmmaking, where familiar elements are recombined and expanded upon to create new narratives while maintaining connection to beloved source material.

## 2. The Literary Feud: High Art Versus Popular Entertainment

***"The ibis was a foul feeder of gluttonous and indiscriminate voracity, scavenging any kind of filth or carrion"***

The rivalry between Apollonius and Callimachus represents an eternal cultural debate about the value of popular versus elite art. **Callimachus**, the most celebrated poet of his age, wrote delicate, recondite poems and believed that attempting Homeric epic in the Hellenistic age was futile - the circumstances that made such epics meaningful had vanished. His nickname for Apollonius was "the ibis," a bird known for its indiscriminate consumption of garbage and its supposed habit of giving itself colonic irrigation with its own beak.

Callimachus argued that **epic poetry could only be pastiche in the modern age**, bombastic and meretricious trash that poisoned the pure springs of ancient myth. His position resembles modern highbrow critics dismissing Marvel films in favor of art house cinema. Apollonius responded with characteristic directness, writing a one-line poem structured like an encyclopedia entry that dismissed Callimachus as "trash, a cheap joke, a blockhead."

## 3. Greek Exploration and the Historical Basis of Myth

***"Greeks are venturing out into seas where you could well believe that you'd come across clashing rocks or monsters or sirens"***

The Jason myth likely preserves memories of **Greek colonization efforts in the 8th-7th centuries BC**, when Greeks established settlements across the Black Sea, including in Crimea and the Caucasus region. These voyages into unknown waters, where genuine dangers awaited, provided the experiential foundation for tales of monsters and magical obstacles. The stories function similarly to Viking sagas of Atlantic exploration or tales of Russian river navigation.

By Apollonius's time in 250 BC, however, the Mediterranean and Black Sea were thoroughly mapped and civilized. This geographical knowledge created a problem for epic writers - no educated person could believe in monsters inhabiting familiar waters. Apollonius solved this by **routing the Argonauts' return journey through central Europe**, along the Danube and Rh√¥ne rivers, territories still mysterious enough to accommodate fantastic elements.

## 4. Medea: From Helper to Child-Killer

***"She chops her brother up into little pieces and throws it out into the sea"***

Medea's character underwent dramatic evolution across different tellings. In **Pindar's version**, she appears as a heroic figure whose magical aid proves crucial to Jason's success. She provides the fire-resistant ointment that protects him from the fire-breathing bulls, advises him on defeating the skeleton warriors, and drugs the dragon guarding the fleece. Aphrodite's arrow causes her to fall in love, making her betray her father for Jason.

**Euripides transformed Medea into a figure of terrifying vengeance**. His version includes her dismembering her brother during the escape, tricking Pelias's daughters into murdering their father by demonstrating rejuvenation magic on a ram, and ultimately killing her own children after Jason abandons her for a Corinthian princess. She sends the princess a poisoned dress that causes her to vanish in flames, then escapes in a dragon-drawn chariot after the infanticide. This darker portrayal became canonical, forcing later writers like Apollonius to navigate around or soften these elements.

## 5. Alexander's Divine Pretensions and Religious Transformation

***"The other gods are far distant or have no ears or do not exist or ignore us but you we can see before us"***

Alexander the Great traveled with an elaborate edition of the Iliad under his pillow and **genuinely believed himself to be the son of Zeus** after visiting the oracle of Siwa. He built altars to the twelve Olympians when crossing the Hellespont and saw traces of Dionysus's passage in Afghanistan, identifying ivy-covered burial mounds as boundary stones left by the god. His ambition to surpass even divine achievements ultimately failed when his troops mutinied at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC.

The Hellenistic rulers who followed Alexander increasingly claimed divine status. **Demetrius the Besieger** was welcomed to Athens in 295 BC as a living god, with dancers carrying giant phalluses as if celebrating Dionysus's arrival. The Athenians, who had mocked Alexander's divine pretensions, now proclaimed that traditional gods were distant or non-existent while Demetrius was present and real. He lived with his mistress in the Parthenon and referred to Athena as his sister, marking a complete transformation in religious sensibility.

## 6. Euhemerus and the Rationalization of Myth

***"Zeus hadn't been a god at all - he'd been a mortal king of Crete who after his death had come to be worshiped as a god"***

The philosopher **Euhemerus** wrote a bestselling work called the Sacred Register, claiming to have discovered hieroglyphic inscriptions on an Indian Ocean island revealing that all Olympian gods were originally mortal rulers later deified. This theory's popularity indicates a substantial market for philosophical works challenging traditional religious narratives by the 3rd century BC.

This rationalization reflected broader intellectual skepticism about Olympian mythology among educated elites in places like Alexandria's Mouseion. **Self-respecting intellectuals increasingly viewed traditional myths as obvious fabrications**, comparable to modern academic embarrassment about literal belief in virgin births or divine incarnations. Yet this rejection of "superstition" merely created space for new forms of belief.

## 7. Epicurus: The Cult of Enlightened Detachment

***"Always act as though Epicurus is watching"***

**Epicurus** taught an atomistic universe where gods existed but didn't intervene in human affairs. His interest in natural philosophy aimed not at proto-scientific understanding but at demonstrating the pointlessness of traditional beliefs, leading to ataraxia (tranquility) as life's ultimate goal. His philosophy represented radical rejection of classical Athenian values, advocating withdrawal from civic engagement.

Despite rejecting interventionist deities, **Epicurus operated remarkably like a cult leader**. He established a commune funded by wealthy admirers, demanded first fruits traditionally offered to gods, and referred to his body as holy. His followers called him "the leader" during life and "soter" (savior) after death, holding commemorative feasts that prefigured Christian practices. The movement demonstrated how rejection of traditional gods created space for new forms of devotion rather than pure rationalism.

## 8. Planetary Deities and Astrological Determinism

***"The doom that's written in the stars if you believe in astrology is something that you can't escape"***

The Hellenistic period saw **planets identified with Greek gods**, influenced by Egyptian and Babylonian astronomical traditions. Mercury became Hermes (the swift messenger), Venus became Aphrodite (the brightest and most beautiful), Mars became Ares (blood-colored war god), and Jupiter became Zeus (the largest, king of gods). These celestial deities proved more tyrannical than traditional Olympians, being completely indifferent to human prayers or sacrifices.

**Astrological determinism offered a bleaker worldview** than traditional religion - fate was locked in stellar movements, unchangeable by ritual or devotion. An even darker possibility emerged in the worship of Tyche (Fortune), suggesting no cosmic order existed at all. An Athenian poet expressed this despair: "It's not logos which guides the affairs of mortals but Tyche." These competing systems reflected profound uncertainty about divine nature and human agency.

## 9. The Persistence of Traditional Practice

***"For lots of people they do continue to feel that the gods are imminent and that by practicing these rituals and these festivals they are in communion with the gods"***

While intellectuals debated and philosophers theorized, **ordinary people continued traditional religious practices**. Ancient festivals and rituals persisted even under foreign rule, though for some they became merely ceremonial, equivalent to modern military parades or national holidays. For many others, however, these practices maintained genuine spiritual significance, providing continued communion with divine forces.

The success of works like the Argonautica suggests **widespread popular appetite for mythological narratives**. Apollonius himself, despite being a sophisticated scholar who catalogued the Library of Alexandria and established canonical Homeric texts, clearly missed and loved the gods. His epic represents not naive belief but deliberate mythological reconstruction by someone fully aware of what he was creating.

## 10. From Living Myth to Literary Mythology

***"What is happening in Alexandria with people like Apollonius is that myth is becoming mythology"***

The crucial transformation of the Hellenistic period was **myth becoming mythology** - stories told with conscious awareness of their literary history rather than lived religious experience. Mythology involves studying myths, understanding their backstories, and combining them in scholarly or literary ways. Children's books of Greek myths, Virgil's Aeneid, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and modern adaptations from Shakespeare to Percy Jackson all represent mythology rather than myth.

This transformation explains both the **endurance and limitation of Greek myths** in Western culture. They survive because they began as literary creations - poems rather than purely ritual practices - making them more portable and adaptable than Babylonian or Egyptian religious traditions. Yet being mediated through centuries of non-believers makes it extremely difficult for modern readers to recapture the original mindset where gods were primary actors in human and cosmic affairs. The challenge remains to escape mythology and re-enter the world of living myth.
