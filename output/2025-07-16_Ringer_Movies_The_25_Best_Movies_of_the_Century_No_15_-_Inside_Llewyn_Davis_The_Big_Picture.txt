I I do think if I remember correctly I I do think if I remember correctly that the original list was No Country that the original list was No Country for Old Men which is the accepted um for Old Men which is the accepted um both you know publicly and at the both you know publicly and at the academy academy academy masterpiece of this century of the masterpiece of this century of the Cohens Fargo not eligible as my dad was Cohens Fargo not eligible as my dad was sad to learn. Raising Arizona, not sad to learn. Raising Arizona, not eligible. You know, Miller's Crossing eligible. You know, Miller's Crossing not eligible. Bartonfink there, not eligible. Bartonfink there, Labowski, there's a there's a million, Labowski, there's a there's a million, you know, the A tier of the Coins is you know, the A tier of the Coins is very crowded, very crowded, very crowded, &gt;&gt; but no country is often considered the A &gt;&gt; but no country is often considered the A tier. tier. tier. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it won best picture. And so is &gt;&gt; Yes. And it won best picture. And so is probably the most widely seen of their probably the most widely seen of their films. And films. And films. And &gt;&gt; I think that's probably true. &gt;&gt; I think that's probably true. &gt;&gt; It also came in 2007, which was like one &gt;&gt; It also came in 2007, which was like one of the like the great years of American of the like the great years of American cinema in our lifetimes. And so it being cinema in our lifetimes. And so it being like the cream of the cream of the crop like the cream of the crop makes it pretty significant. Um, but I I makes it pretty significant. Um, but I I think I put No Country on and you pretty think I put No Country on and you pretty instantly were like inside Lou and Davis instantly were like inside Lou and Davis and I just said like yes. And we didn't and I just said like yes. And we didn't even have to talk it out. even we didn't even have to talk it out. Um, so maybe we can actually decide why Um, so maybe we can actually decide why we can talk about why we are both we can talk about why we are both &gt;&gt; for me. Um, you know, I did rewatch No &gt;&gt; for me. Um, you know, I did rewatch No Country also this week in order to like Country also this week in order to like be able to justify it. I didn't want to be able to justify it. I didn't want to be able to talk a little bit why. And be able to talk a little bit why. And &gt;&gt; I I felt even better. I like I felt I I &gt;&gt; I I felt even better. I like I felt I I rewatched Inside Lu and Davis once, was rewatched Inside Lu and Davis once, was like, "Yeah, we smashed this." Then like, "Yeah, we smashed this." Then rewatched No Country again and was like, rewatched No Country again and was like, "Oh, wow. We like really smashed it." "Oh, wow. We like really smashed it." And then uh rewatched Inside Luen Davis And then uh rewatched Inside Luen Davis the second time cuz I hadn't seen it the second time cuz I hadn't seen it probably in like five maybe. probably in like five maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, five five or seven years. Um, and &gt;&gt; Yeah, five five or seven years. Um, and I think for me, in addition to, you I think for me, in addition to, you know, the the basic genre distinctions, know, the the basic genre distinctions, obviously, like no country is a a obviously, like no country is a a western and, you know, I have limited western and, you know, I have limited patience for dust. And this is about a patience for dust. And this is about a like a struggling artist and like and a like a struggling artist and like and a and a very classic Cohen's just like and a very classic Cohen's just like loser guy, a guy who it's just it's not loser guy, a guy who it's just it's not coming together and how much of it is coming together and how much of it is his fault and how much of it is the his fault and how much of it is the world's fault. Actually, it's both. But world's fault. Actually, it's both. But there is an emotion here and and most of there is an emotion here and and most of it is like anger and regret and and it is like anger and regret and and stymied but there are deeply felled stymied but there are deeply felled moments um compared with no country's moments um compared with no country's like total nihilism which it's a feat of like total nihilism which it's a feat of as well but I just find that inside Luen as well but I just find that inside Luen Davis and the Luen Davis character stays Davis and the Luen Davis character stays with me more with me more &gt;&gt; I haven't revisited no country I of &gt;&gt; I haven't revisited no country I of course think it is also a masterpiece so course think it is also a masterpiece so to me I'm not I'm not trying to be like, to me I'm not I'm not trying to be like, yeah, you know, it's not that it's bad. yeah, you know, it's not that it's bad. Um, I think there it could be perceived Um, I think there it could be perceived as like trolling by not picking No as like trolling by not picking No Country. No Country is a movie that I Country. No Country is a movie that I love. I loved it when it came out. Um, I love. I loved it when it came out. Um, I still love it. I haven't revisited in a still love it. I haven't revisited in a little while. little while. little while. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up in a good &gt;&gt; I mean, it's pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up in a good way. way. way. &gt;&gt; And I think it is thematically &gt;&gt; And I think it is thematically consistent with what the Coins are consistent with what the Coins are interested in, which is sort of like interested in, which is sort of like &gt;&gt; everything's bad and there's nothing &gt;&gt; everything's bad and there's nothing waiting for you at the end. You know, waiting for you at the end. You know, that's sort of where a lot of especially that's sort of where a lot of especially this era of their films, you know, a this era of their films, you know, a serious man, which is really my favorite serious man, which is really my favorite movie of theirs of the century, but I movie of theirs of the century, but I know not yours. So, I was I was making know not yours. So, I was I was making that choice to pivot from No Country to that choice to pivot from No Country to another Cohen. I thought Inside Land another Cohen. I thought Inside Land Davis would be kind of a perfect meeting Davis would be kind of a perfect meeting point because point because point because &gt;&gt; it is, as you said, &gt;&gt; it is, as you said, &gt;&gt; a sign like a typical framework. &gt;&gt; a sign like a typical framework. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For them, the the lead character, what &gt;&gt; For them, the the lead character, what he is doing, how he fits in the world, he is doing, how he fits in the world, how the world accepts or rejects him. how the world accepts or rejects him. And it also is like most of the best And it also is like most of the best Cohen's Cohen's Cohen's funnier than No Country for Old Men. funnier than No Country for Old Men. &gt;&gt; Um I think certainly more emotional as &gt;&gt; Um I think certainly more emotional as you said and you said and the music element is pretty profound the music element is pretty profound &gt;&gt; and it's really interesting to revisit &gt;&gt; and it's really interesting to revisit this movie in the aftermath of a this movie in the aftermath of a complete unknown. complete unknown. complete unknown. &gt;&gt; Yes. which, you know, &gt;&gt; Yes. which, you know, &gt;&gt; quite literally puts that story onto the &gt;&gt; quite literally puts that story onto the screen as opposed to this, which is sort screen as opposed to this, which is sort of a draws inspiration from it and is of a draws inspiration from it and is clearly using figures very closely who clearly using figures very closely who are in the world, but isn't as concerned are in the world, but isn't as concerned with biographical detail as it is with with biographical detail as it is with using this moment in time as a portal to using this moment in time as a portal to talk about what it's like to be alive talk about what it's like to be alive then and now. So, I think this is an then and now. So, I think this is an incredibly special movie. I will say incredibly special movie. I will say when I first saw it, I remember vividly when I first saw it, I remember vividly that I did like it, but that I didn't that I did like it, but that I didn't totally I shouldn't say I didn't get it, totally I shouldn't say I didn't get it, but that because it is a quite a but that because it is a quite a meandering movie meandering movie meandering movie &gt;&gt; and it does not have the kind of like &gt;&gt; and it does not have the kind of like &gt;&gt; rocket ship quality of No Country or &gt;&gt; rocket ship quality of No Country or even of True Grit, which is just like a even of True Grit, which is just like a True Grit's like a crowd-pleaser, you True Grit's like a crowd-pleaser, you know, and True Grit was a big hit know, and True Grit was a big hit &gt;&gt; and this movie comes after that movie. &gt;&gt; and this movie comes after that movie. Those two movies are adaptations. This Those two movies are adaptations. This is an original. is an original. I I've probably watched this movie six I I've probably watched this movie six or seven times in my life and I it or seven times in my life and I it really deepens every time I revisit it really deepens every time I revisit it because of the themes, because of Oscar because of the themes, because of Oscar Isaac's performance, Isaac's performance, Isaac's performance, &gt;&gt; because of what I think it means to them &gt;&gt; because of what I think it means to them and how I think their best characters and how I think their best characters are often guys like this. Usually guys, are often guys like this. Usually guys, sometimes women, but usually guys and sometimes women, but usually guys and &gt;&gt; so it's just a very deep and fascinating &gt;&gt; so it's just a very deep and fascinating portrait of portrait of portrait of the American spirit, like the broken the American spirit, like the broken American spirit. American spirit. American spirit. &gt;&gt; Totally. um that also features beautiful &gt;&gt; Totally. um that also features beautiful folk music. So, folk music. So, &gt;&gt; I feel pretty good about there's there's &gt;&gt; I feel pretty good about there's there's a variety of other things that we can a variety of other things that we can talk through. Uh any do you do you want talk through. Uh any do you do you want to talk through the other Coins that to talk through the other Coins that like could have been contenders during like could have been contenders during this 25-y year period? Like O Brother is this 25-y year period? Like O Brother is 2000. We could have talked about that 2000. We could have talked about that that pick that pick that pick &gt;&gt; and and when my dad uh was trying to &gt;&gt; and and when my dad uh was trying to guess the movies on the list and first guess the movies on the list and first guessed Fargo, sorry.

And &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a spoiler, I guess. And also, maybe we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a little bit. also, maybe we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a little bit. Um Um Um &gt;&gt; I'll pull up his filmography while &gt;&gt; I'll pull up his filmography while you're speaking. you're speaking. you're speaking. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I, you know, I I do love Burn &gt;&gt; Okay. But I, you know, I I do love Burn After Reading. That is pure black After Reading. That is pure black comedy. Um, so we are tending with the comedy. Um, so we are tending with the exception of the anchor mans towards exception of the anchor mans towards like the, you know, the dark knights of like the, you know, the dark knights of the soul on this list in one way or the soul on this list in one way or another. another. another. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think what else. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think what else. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we do.

Um, &gt;&gt; Appreciate it. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah, there's something really dark and &gt;&gt; yeah, there's something really dark and something really light about this movie. something really light about this movie. I think every time it runs the risk of I think every time it runs the risk of becoming too morose and self-pitying, he becoming too morose and self-pitying, he shows us they show us shows us they show us &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; the slapstick that they're really gifted &gt;&gt; the slapstick that they're really gifted at. You know, there's a lot of physical at. You know, there's a lot of physical comedy in this movie. There's a lot of comedy in this movie. There's a lot of physical expression in this movie, but physical expression in this movie, but there's also a lot of time just looking there's also a lot of time just looking at Oscar Isaac's sad face. at Oscar Isaac's sad face. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And his kind of mournful like, how did I &gt;&gt; And his kind of mournful like, how did I why am I getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this? You why am I getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this? You know, that sense of doom. And I think know, that sense of doom. And I think every single really every single really dark or down moment in the in the movie dark or down moment in the in the movie also has humor in it because also has humor in it because &gt;&gt; and I this is one of the ways that I &gt;&gt; and I this is one of the ways that I relate to the Cohens is like they can relate to the Cohens is like they can they can only really deal with the bad they can only really deal with the bad stuff through um you know a twisted stuff through um you know a twisted cynical sense of humor. So you have cynical sense of humor. So you have Oscar Isaac Oscar Isaac Oscar Isaac like absolutely pouring his like h like like absolutely pouring his like h like heart on the line for F Marie Abraham heart on the line for F Marie Abraham and you know and that's like the like and you know and that's like the like his big moment. It's shot like he's his big moment. It's shot like he's outside the pearly gates, you know? It's outside the pearly gates, you know? It's like literally like is he going to make like literally like is he going to make it or is it not? Is he not? And then I it or is it not? Is he not? And then I don't see a lot of money here, which is don't see a lot of money here, which is an absolutely cutting essential thematic an absolutely cutting essential thematic line. And also just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny. like line. And also just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny. like really really and and they just hold on really really and and they just hold on Fury Abraham and he's just like it's Fury Abraham and he's just like it's devastating and still a little bit of devastating and still a little bit of wit or when he plays for his father and wit or when he plays for his father and there's like are they connecting like there's like are they connecting like what's what's going on without words what's what's going on without words here and through this music and and then here and through this music and and then um there is some scatological humor. So, um there is some scatological humor. So, it's it's it's there is they're all they're they're there is they're all they're they're working through it and you can feel them working through it and you can feel them like working through it in these moments like working through it in these moments where sometimes in some of the other where sometimes in some of the other movies it's like a little closed off. movies it's like a little closed off. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; I think that's partially because they've &gt;&gt; I think that's partially because they've talked in the past about how they don't talked in the past about how they don't map out their movies. Like they just map out their movies. Like they just start writing and then they just write start writing and then they just write through to where they think it should through to where they think it should go. And a lot of the times they end up go. And a lot of the times they end up with something that is very tight with something that is very tight &gt;&gt; and very um you know, it can be a little &gt;&gt; and very um you know, it can be a little suffocating their world. If you can't suffocating their world. If you can't get onto their register, if you can't get onto their register, if you can't get oxygenated with the Coins, then they get oxygenated with the Coins, then they can be limiting for some people. I can be limiting for some people. I obviously they're in a very rare air for obviously they're in a very rare air for me. I love me. I love &gt;&gt; pretty much all their movies, give or &gt;&gt; pretty much all their movies, give or take one or two, take one or two, &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; this movie is a little bit warmer and a &gt;&gt; this movie is a little bit warmer and a little bit colder at the same time. little bit colder at the same time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that balance of those temperatures, &gt;&gt; And that balance of those temperatures, I think, is really special here. And the I think, is really special here. And the I don't see a lot of money here thing is I don't see a lot of money here thing is definitely one of the reasons why I definitely one of the reasons why I think this movie is so profound cuz it's think this movie is so profound cuz it's like these are two guys who it's it's a like these are two guys who it's it's a I'm not sure if it's a bit rude as a I'm not sure if it's a bit rude as a point of view for the film because these point of view for the film because these are two guys who basically never are two guys who basically never compromised who always made what they compromised who always made what they wanted to make firmly came out of wanted to make firmly came out of independent cinema and firmly believed independent cinema and firmly believed in their point of view and somehow in their point of view and somehow turned themselves into not just turned themselves into not just artistically but commercially successful artistically but commercially successful artists. I mean, they've made movies artists. I mean, they've made movies that have made hund00 million. that have made hund00 million. &gt;&gt; And, &gt;&gt; And, &gt;&gt; And, &gt;&gt; you know, you point out the the &gt;&gt; you know, you point out the the conversation between Carrie Mulligan's conversation between Carrie Mulligan's character and Oscar Isaac's character character and Oscar Isaac's character where he says, "You were calling me a where he says, "You were calling me a careerist." She says, "You were calling careerist." She says, "You were calling me a careerist and I was calling you a me a careerist and I was calling you a loser." loser." loser." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's a really fascinating &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's a really fascinating exchange because he is attacking her for exchange because he is attacking her for wanting a suburban life, children, wanting a suburban life, children, comfort. comfort. comfort. &gt;&gt; And she is mocking him for having this &gt;&gt; And she is mocking him for having this kind of overmanaged sacred idea about kind of overmanaged sacred idea about artistry, which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know artistry, which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know that like there is a certainly a that like there is a certainly a universe where you can have both of universe where you can have both of those things. But because he's a person those things. But because he's a person who is both unwilling to compromise and who is both unwilling to compromise and not shrewd, which is a very devastating not shrewd, which is a very devastating place to be if you're an artist, you got place to be if you're an artist, you got to get really lucky. Now, whether the to get really lucky. Now, whether the Cohens are actually very shrewd business Cohens are actually very shrewd business people or creatives, they might be. people or creatives, they might be. &gt;&gt; You know, they've consistently been able &gt;&gt; You know, they've consistently been able to get movies made to get movies made &gt;&gt; for 40 years. &gt;&gt; for 40 years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um but coming from it's like this is &gt;&gt; Um but coming from it's like this is come rich coming from you is how I feel come rich coming from you is how I feel watching the movies sometimes. watching the movies sometimes. &gt;&gt; Not in a bad way. Um, and then there's &gt;&gt; Not in a bad way. Um, and then there's another thing too which is about sort of another thing too which is about sort of like the fractious and bickering nature like the fractious and bickering nature of artists where you've got inside the of artists where you've got inside the folk scene a lot of different folk scene a lot of different philosophies around what is and is not philosophies around what is and is not folk music. You've got a jazz musician folk music. You've got a jazz musician who really looks down on the folky. who really looks down on the folky. You've got a beat poet who sort of like You've got a beat poet who sort of like doesn't relate to anybody and feels doesn't relate to anybody and feels completely alienated completely alienated completely alienated &gt;&gt; and doesn't say anything. &gt;&gt; and doesn't say anything. &gt;&gt; Barely speaks &gt;&gt; Barely speaks &gt;&gt; except for his terrible beat poetry. &gt;&gt; except for his terrible beat poetry. Yes. And even I mean the Yes. And even I mean the the rivalries and the disrespect among the rivalries and the disrespect among the folk community and you know Oscar the folk community and you know Oscar Isaac or Luen Davis is is like the pure Isaac or Luen Davis is is like the pure folk singer quote unquote but that has folk singer quote unquote but that has diminishing returns. Um and then he is diminishing returns. Um and then he is surrounded by people who are performing surrounded by people who are performing and portrayed in this film as just and portrayed in this film as just completely insufferable like very funny. completely insufferable like very funny. It's it's mean, but also great and and It's it's mean, but also great and and and typified, and typified, and typified, &gt;&gt; you know, most thoroughly by Justin &gt;&gt; you know, most thoroughly by Justin Timberlake in in one of the great Timberlake in in one of the great casting uh uh coups of of anyone's casting uh uh coups of of anyone's career. career. career. &gt;&gt; I would love to know how aware Justin &gt;&gt; I would love to know how aware Justin Timberlake is of how he was used in this Timberlake is of how he was used in this movie because he is the classical movie because he is the classical &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; pop tool. I don't mean like Tulle like &gt;&gt; pop tool. I don't mean like Tulle like in a derogatory sense, but I kind of do. in a derogatory sense, but I kind of do. &gt;&gt; I thought you actually did. &gt;&gt; I thought you actually did. &gt;&gt; I kind of do. I I do think he eventually &gt;&gt; I kind of do. I I do think he eventually became a kind of interesting pop star became a kind of interesting pop star and I definitely enjoy his solo albums. and I definitely enjoy his solo albums. But But But &gt;&gt; he was a boy band machine and he is &gt;&gt; he was a boy band machine and he is identified in this movie as a guy who is identified in this movie as a guy who is basically willing to compromise his folk basically willing to compromise his folk ethics ethics ethics &gt;&gt; to write novelty tunes for record labels &gt;&gt; to write novelty tunes for record labels about going to space. about going to space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And at this time, Justin Timberlake was &gt;&gt; And at this time, Justin Timberlake was the voice of McDonald's. And the voice of McDonald's. And That's an ingenious stroke by the That's an ingenious stroke by the &gt;&gt; Cohens. This is three years after he is &gt;&gt; Cohens. This is three years after he is the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] billionaire in Sean Parker the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] billionaire in Sean Parker in the social network. in the social network. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; So he must have some awareness, but also he must have some awareness, but also like all evidence of the 10 years after like all evidence of the 10 years after this or 12 years and this is going to this or 12 years and this is going to ruin the tour suggests that perhaps ruin the tour suggests that perhaps &gt;&gt; not. &gt;&gt; not. &gt;&gt; not. &gt;&gt; Maybe he doesn't maybe he didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Maybe he doesn't maybe he didn't get it. Maybe he didn't know that he was being Maybe he didn't know that he was being identified by frankly very cold-hearted identified by frankly very cold-hearted filmmakers like David Fincher and the filmmakers like David Fincher and the Cohen brothers. Uh anyhow, they took Cohen brothers. Uh anyhow, they took advantage of his fame and advantage of his fame and &gt;&gt; you think Timberlake's really into &gt;&gt; you think Timberlake's really into Zodiac and so he's like, "Yeah, I'm Zodiac and so he's like, "Yeah, I'm going to that's what I'm going to going to that's what I'm going to &gt;&gt; I think it's possible that he thinks he &gt;&gt; I think it's possible that he thinks he is." is." is." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um, &gt;&gt; Sure. Um, so the other thing about this movie too so the other thing about this movie too is that he is be his character is being is that he is be his character is being cucked so hard by Lou and Davis because cucked so hard by Lou and Davis because he is a member of Gan and Jim, this he is a member of Gan and Jim, this couple with Carrie Mulligan. Do we even couple with Carrie Mulligan. Do we even I guess we see them perform together one I guess we see them perform together one time, but we very rarely see them time, but we very rarely see them interacting with each other. interacting with each other. &gt;&gt; See um with the other guy. &gt;&gt; See um with the other guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The third. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The third. &gt;&gt; Yes. But otherwise, yes, they basically &gt;&gt; Yes. But otherwise, yes, they basically they're seated at the table in the club they're seated at the table in the club for one moment, but she goes away very for one moment, but she goes away very quickly cuz she doesn't want to be quickly cuz she doesn't want to be involved. It's a it's a very clever semi involved. It's a it's a very clever semi self-referential joke. Adam Driver also self-referential joke. Adam Driver also hilarious in this movie as Al Cody Space hilarious in this movie as Al Cody Space &gt;&gt; the cowboy counterpart to Jim &gt;&gt; the cowboy counterpart to Jim &gt;&gt; and this is early girls era like this is &gt;&gt; and this is early girls era like this is this is pretty early Adam Driver um and this is pretty early Adam Driver um and also very very exciting but early on the also very very exciting but early on the scene scene scene &gt;&gt; it's right on the precipice of the Force &gt;&gt; it's right on the precipice of the Force Awakens when he is set to become a Awakens when he is set to become a bigger movie star. I sure wish I could bigger movie star. I sure wish I could have had at least one more one movie have had at least one more one movie where Adam Driver was the star of a Cone where Adam Driver was the star of a Cone Brothers movie. I I He's maybe like a Brothers movie. I I He's maybe like a little too big and strong. That's not little too big and strong. That's not really what they do. He would need to be really what they do. He would need to be a little lankier. a little lankier. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; They don't He could broad chested men. &gt;&gt; They don't He could broad chested men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, in this era, he was &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, in this era, he was lankier. lankier. lankier. &gt;&gt; You know, he's lanky in this movie &gt;&gt; You know, he's lanky in this movie there. There not a lot of swole guys, there. There not a lot of swole guys, but so, you know, maybe he could cut but so, you know, maybe he could cut back on the macros. back on the macros. To me, the thing the the number one To me, the thing the the number one reason why this movie is going in is reason why this movie is going in is because it I think it's the best movie because it I think it's the best movie about a very specific idea, which is about a very specific idea, which is being the other guy. And we we learn being the other guy. And we we learn this at the end of the movie because this at the end of the movie because there's a big reveal in terms of the there's a big reveal in terms of the circular structure of the movie. But circular structure of the movie. But it's clear if you know anything about it's clear if you know anything about the folk scene from the first moments the folk scene from the first moments based on the songs that Oscar Isaac's based on the songs that Oscar Isaac's character is singing that the movie is character is singing that the movie is modeled on Dave Vanrock. Dave Enron was modeled on Dave Vanrock. Dave Enron was a contemporary of Bob Dylan, one of the a contemporary of Bob Dylan, one of the signature folk artists of the Greenwich signature folk artists of the Greenwich Village scene. In real life, not an Village scene. In real life, not an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the way that Luen Davis is, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the way that Luen Davis is, but but but &gt;&gt; his Wikipedia page is just like he was &gt;&gt; his Wikipedia page is just like he was lovely and was interested in all like lovely and was interested in all like types of music and a founding member of types of music and a founding member of the Greenwich Village community. the Greenwich Village community. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you he is a big part of No &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you he is a big part of No Direction Home, the Martin Scorsese Bob Direction Home, the Martin Scorsese Bob Dylan documentary, which is really Dylan documentary, which is really really great. If people haven't seen really great. If people haven't seen that, I talked about it during the the that, I talked about it during the the complete unknown episode. And you can complete unknown episode. And you can see he's just he seems like a nice man. see he's just he seems like a nice man. Yeah. So, it's not ideal that this Yeah. So, it's not ideal that this happened to him. Although, I will say happened to him. Although, I will say Oscar Isaac is certainly a bit more Oscar Isaac is certainly a bit more handsome than Dave Van was. So, there's handsome than Dave Van was. So, there's a trade-off there. Uh but Van Rank is a a trade-off there. Uh but Van Rank is a guy who's like very loyal to the folk guy who's like very loyal to the folk cause, the artistic cause, understood um cause, the artistic cause, understood um a lot of historical American forms of a lot of historical American forms of music and sat deeply in the scene and music and sat deeply in the scene and also watched Bob Dylan hit the scene and also watched Bob Dylan hit the scene and Bob Dylan take off like a rocket and Bob Dylan take off like a rocket and then leave the scene and kind of leave then leave the scene and kind of leave behind a lot of these figures. behind a lot of these figures. &gt;&gt; And the fact that there's a movie that &gt;&gt; And the fact that there's a movie that is focusing on the guy who didn't win is is focusing on the guy who didn't win is tremendously unusual. There's just not a tremendously unusual. There's just not a lot of examples, especially in the world lot of examples, especially in the world of the arts of the arts &gt;&gt; but that's it. &gt;&gt; but that's it. &gt;&gt; It's featuring F. Marie Abraham. &gt;&gt; It's featuring F. Marie Abraham. &gt;&gt; Um, it is, but at least that movie has a &gt;&gt; Um, it is, but at least that movie has a lot of lot of lot of &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. And you like, yeah, you &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. And you like, yeah, you understand. understand. understand. &gt;&gt; You see him conducting and you're like, &gt;&gt; You see him conducting and you're like, he's Mozart. he's Mozart. he's Mozart. &gt;&gt; It's doing both. It's the idea, but not &gt;&gt; It's doing both. It's the idea, but not the execution. Um, this movie as a kind the execution. Um, this movie as a kind of counter, and that would make a good of counter, and that would make a good double feature actually, but this movie double feature actually, but this movie as a counter, as a counter, &gt;&gt; we only see Bob Dylan perform once. &gt;&gt; we only see Bob Dylan perform once. &gt;&gt; But when we see him perform in the final &gt;&gt; But when we see him perform in the final moments of the movie, moments of the movie, &gt;&gt; it also makes sense &gt;&gt; it also makes sense &gt;&gt; because even though his voice is not as &gt;&gt; because even though his voice is not as purely beautiful, as you know, in key as purely beautiful, as you know, in key as Oscar Isaac's voice, there's money Oscar Isaac's voice, there's money there. There's something there with there. There's something there with Dylan. And so the whole movie is this Dylan. And so the whole movie is this psychological portrait of a guy psychological portrait of a guy maybe deep down knowing but not being maybe deep down knowing but not being able to accept that he's the other guy, able to accept that he's the other guy, that he's not the winner, right? You that he's not the winner, right? You know, he keeps impregnating women who know, he keeps impregnating women who he's not dating. he's not dating. &gt;&gt; His musical partner has jumped off the &gt;&gt; His musical partner has jumped off the George Washington Bridge, George Washington Bridge, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's lost a cat. &gt;&gt; He's lost a cat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He signs away the royalties. &gt;&gt; He signs away the royalties. &gt;&gt; Well, he lost someone else's cat and &gt;&gt; Well, he lost someone else's cat and then he has a tango with his own cat, then he has a tango with his own cat, but he can't even commit to the cat. but he can't even commit to the cat. &gt;&gt; Some cat trouble in this movie. Um, and &gt;&gt; Some cat trouble in this movie. Um, and he signs away the royalties to the he signs away the royalties to the Please Mr. Kennedy song. Please Mr. Kennedy song. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is in the moment you're like &gt;&gt; Which is in the moment you're like &gt;&gt; the slowmoving car crash. What are you &gt;&gt; the slowmoving car crash. What are you doing? Don't sign away the royalties to doing? Don't sign away the royalties to your pop song. No, you fool. Just cuz your pop song. No, you fool. Just cuz you need 200 bucks. Um, so yeah, it's a you need 200 bucks. Um, so yeah, it's a it's a it's a miserableist doomed man. it's a it's a miserableist doomed man. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; In a Cohen brothers movie, but funny &gt;&gt; In a Cohen brothers movie, but funny with great songs. with great songs. &gt;&gt; So easy pick, I think. I don't know. &gt;&gt; So easy pick, I think. I don't know. What do you think the like standing What do you think the like standing reputation of this movie is right now? reputation of this movie is right now? &gt;&gt; I think that it's really admired, but I &gt;&gt; I think that it's really admired, but I don't think it's trollish to include don't think it's trollish to include this. I guess it's maybe like a little this. I guess it's maybe like a little counterfactual, but that's what we do counterfactual, but that's what we do here. Um, but I think also, here. Um, but I think also, &gt;&gt; you anecdotally, I told my husband I was &gt;&gt; you anecdotally, I told my husband I was like, "Oh yeah, we're doing Inside Lu like, "Oh yeah, we're doing Inside Lu and Davis." And he was like, "That's and Davis." And he was like, "That's sick." And then he was like, "I'll come sick." And then he was like, "I'll come watch it with you." And was like, "I watch it with you." And was like, "I love that you guys are doing this one." love that you guys are doing this one." Uh, so then I told him some other Uh, so then I told him some other feature picks and he's like, I don't feature picks and he's like, I don't agree. So, you know, to me that was a agree. So, you know, to me that was a goodiz. Okay. Like, look, we got it. Um, goodiz. Okay. Like, look, we got it. Um, I think admired but not celebrated in I think admired but not celebrated in the same way. And I don't know whether the same way. And I don't know whether that's because that's because that's because it it it mirrors like the other guy it it it mirrors like the other guy trajectory. trajectory. trajectory. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; can I can I suggest a theory about this? &gt;&gt; can I can I suggest a theory about this? &gt;&gt; Okay. At the time when the movie was &gt;&gt; Okay. At the time when the movie was coming out, we were at the very coming out, we were at the very beginning of the Oscar Isaac moment. beginning of the Oscar Isaac moment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he had appeared in Chris Ryan's &gt;&gt; So, he had appeared in Chris Ryan's Beloved Born Legacy. Beloved Born Legacy. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; As the third guy. &gt;&gt; As the third guy. &gt;&gt; Um, and then he has a run of inside Luen &gt;&gt; Um, and then he has a run of inside Luen Davis, uh, A Most Violent Year, Davis, uh, A Most Violent Year, &gt;&gt; XM Machina. &gt;&gt; XM Machina. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And culminating in Star Wars: The Force &gt;&gt; And culminating in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Awakens. Awakens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was being presented to us in the &gt;&gt; And he was being presented to us in the Force Awakens as the new Han Solo. Yeah. Force Awakens as the new Han Solo. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The dashing rebel. &gt;&gt; The dashing rebel. And before awakens made a billion And before awakens made a billion dollars and was a massive success dollars and was a massive success &gt;&gt; and he was very good in it. &gt;&gt; and he was very good in it. &gt;&gt; He's great in the movie. I think that &gt;&gt; He's great in the movie. I think that character is a little character is a little &gt;&gt; underwritten. &gt;&gt; underwritten. &gt;&gt; underwritten. &gt;&gt; The thing is that Han Solo was also in &gt;&gt; The thing is that Han Solo was also in that movie. So that movie. So &gt;&gt; not ideal. The other thing is that Adam &gt;&gt; not ideal. The other thing is that Adam Driver was in that movie and I think the Driver was in that movie and I think the takeaway from that movie which people takeaway from that movie which people liked was that you know Adam Driver and liked was that you know Adam Driver and then I think also Daisy Ridley were the then I think also Daisy Ridley were the real standouts right real standouts right &gt;&gt; and he was a slightly older guy trying &gt;&gt; and he was a slightly older guy trying to seem cool to seem cool &gt;&gt; and Oscar Isaac has not stopped working &gt;&gt; and Oscar Isaac has not stopped working since that movie. He's had a very since that movie. He's had a very successful career. He is a little bit successful career. He is a little bit closer to like an A+ character actor now closer to like an A+ character actor now than he is a leading man. And the than he is a leading man. And the leading man thing never fully leading man thing never fully &gt;&gt; concretized. &gt;&gt; concretized. &gt;&gt; concretized. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now maybe this movie is a &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now maybe this movie is a little bit more forgotten than it would little bit more forgotten than it would have been if he had been in hit after have been if he had been in hit after hit after hit in the last 10 years. Do hit after hit in the last 10 years. Do you what do you think? you what do you think? &gt;&gt; And also slightly more prophetic, you &gt;&gt; And also slightly more prophetic, you know, but it like it's it's all baked know, but it like it's it's all baked into the thing. It like into the thing. It like Yeah. But the sense that he is, Yeah. But the sense that he is, you know, he is playing the other guy, you know, he is playing the other guy, the person who doesn't quite have the person who doesn't quite have whatever it is and a and a movie that I whatever it is and a and a movie that I think is like artistically like sublime, think is like artistically like sublime, but doesn't but doesn't but doesn't &gt;&gt; didn't commercially break through in the &gt;&gt; didn't commercially break through in the in the same way that their previous in the same way that their previous films had.

Is it because it's the more more slapsticky mode of the the more more slapsticky mode of the Cohens? Cohens? Cohens? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's not that I don't like &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's not that I don't like they're very good at that and I I they're very good at that and I I appreciate it but appreciate it but I don't know honestly when Clooney is I don't know honestly when Clooney is trying that hard to be funny. trying that hard to be funny. &gt;&gt; It unless it's and it's I guess it's &gt;&gt; It unless it's and it's I guess it's sort of making fun of him and burn after sort of making fun of him and burn after reading it. He's making a lot of fun of reading it. He's making a lot of fun of himself. himself. himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But yeah, it doesn't quite land for me &gt;&gt; But yeah, it doesn't quite land for me comedically the way the others do. comedically the way the others do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like it quite a bit, but it does &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like it quite a bit, but it does feel kind of stacked in the middle. I feel kind of stacked in the middle. I know for some people like I know David know for some people like I know David Shoemaker, for example, that's his Shoemaker, for example, that's his favorite Cohen brothers movie and one of favorite Cohen brothers movie and one of his favorite movies of all time, which I his favorite movies of all time, which I was surprised to hear when he said that, was surprised to hear when he said that, but um I know it holds a special place but um I know it holds a special place and I think some people will look at the and I think some people will look at the list and be like, "Well, that is 21st list and be like, "Well, that is 21st Century and it's a music movie and it's Century and it's a music movie and it's the Odyssey and it's an arc about a the Odyssey and it's an arc about a loser." loser." loser." &gt;&gt; Well, guess what?

Does this movie look better after Does this movie look better after complete unknown? Are they just a complete unknown? Are they just a perfect match for two different film perfect match for two different film making sensibilities? making sensibilities? making sensibilities? Does it How do you feel? Does it How do you feel? &gt;&gt; It definitely looks better. Yeah. Come &gt;&gt; It definitely looks better. Yeah. Come on. because it and it is also on. because it and it is also I I think that that I mean it's a great I I think that that I mean it's a great double feature also because what a double feature also because what a complete unknown is doing and like sort complete unknown is doing and like sort of interrogating but also not of interrogating but also not interrogating like the lack of interrogating like the lack of interrogation in a complete unknown to interrogation in a complete unknown to me is a little bit interesting but it me is a little bit interesting but it does also have like the 4,000 shots of does also have like the 4,000 shots of everyone gazing adoringly. Well, that's everyone gazing adoringly. Well, that's the thing the thing the thing &gt;&gt; and and this is just like 4,000 shots of &gt;&gt; and and this is just like 4,000 shots of Oscar Isaac being like, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate Oscar Isaac being like, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate you. you. you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing that's was so &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing that's was so interesting is interesting is interesting is &gt;&gt; A complete unknown. I think this was a &gt;&gt; A complete unknown. I think this was a great choice. This is the best thing great choice. This is the best thing about the movie. But A Complete Unknown about the movie. But A Complete Unknown feels like James Mangold watched Inside feels like James Mangold watched Inside Lu Davis. Lu Davis. Lu Davis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watched the last 30 seconds of Bob Dylan &gt;&gt; Watched the last 30 seconds of Bob Dylan singing farewell. singing farewell. singing farewell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and then was like that I'm going &gt;&gt; Yeah. and then was like that I'm going to make a whole movie like that where to make a whole movie like that where we're at a distance, we're at a remove. we're at a distance, we're at a remove. &gt;&gt; We cannot deny the power and beauty of &gt;&gt; We cannot deny the power and beauty of what this person represents, but it is what this person represents, but it is still mysterious to us. still mysterious to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we will not really &gt;&gt; And we will not really &gt;&gt; process someone on the outside of that &gt;&gt; process someone on the outside of that experience as much. Those are the only experience as much. Those are the only people that we get to really feel their people that we get to really feel their feelings, but feelings, but feelings, but &gt;&gt; that I they're really neatly matched. &gt;&gt; that I they're really neatly matched. It's really cool that like 10 years It's really cool that like 10 years later you basically get a response later you basically get a response movie. The response the response movie movie. The response the response movie is like a little bit more wrote typical. is like a little bit more wrote typical. &gt;&gt; Sure. A little bit more commercial and &gt;&gt; Sure. A little bit more commercial and not as I think the performances in the not as I think the performances in the response movie are very good. I think response movie are very good. I think &gt;&gt; very good &gt;&gt; very good &gt;&gt; the the cinematography and the &gt;&gt; the the cinematography and the production design and just the production design and just the recreation of the village in inside Luen recreation of the village in inside Luen Davis is unsurprisingly like pitch Davis is unsurprisingly like pitch perfect. Yeah. Um, and so when you perfect. Yeah. Um, and so when you compare the two of them, A complete compare the two of them, A complete unknown just looks a little bit more unknown just looks a little bit more like they put Instagram filters on like they put Instagram filters on something, you know, something, you know, &gt;&gt; sometimes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; sometimes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what that movie the the A &gt;&gt; You know what that movie the the A complete unknown gets something right complete unknown gets something right though that a lot of the folks were though that a lot of the folks were really mad about with inside Luen Davis, really mad about with inside Luen Davis, which is that which is that &gt;&gt; it feels like a kind of more like &gt;&gt; it feels like a kind of more like rambunctious time of revalry in the folk rambunctious time of revalry in the folk scene where it's like everybody kind of scene where it's like everybody kind of knew each other. It was very knew each other. It was very competitive, but people were getting competitive, but people were getting drunk and they were having sex and it drunk and they were having sex and it was it felt more like a was it felt more like a &gt;&gt; getting drunk and having sex in this &gt;&gt; getting drunk and having sex in this movie. It's just that that that's movie. It's just that that that's experienced in in different experienced in in different &gt;&gt; a very mournful version of sex though, &gt;&gt; a very mournful version of sex though, you know, a very mournful version of you know, a very mournful version of drinking. It doesn't there's not a lot drinking. It doesn't there's not a lot of celebration. And so I think, of celebration. And so I think, &gt;&gt; you know, a lot of these boomers looked &gt;&gt; you know, a lot of these boomers looked back at this movie when they released back at this movie when they released it. it. it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they were like, ironically, &gt;&gt; Yeah.
