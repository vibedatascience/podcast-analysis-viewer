inflection points caused by technological change our weekly technological change our weekly conversation covers the obvious and not conversation covers the obvious and not so obvious ways in which markets and so obvious ways in which markets and businesses will adapt as a result let's businesses will adapt as a result let's Jump Right Jump Right Jump Right In hello everybody we're uh lucky to In hello everybody we're uh lucky to have a very special guest on this have a very special guest on this episode uh Tay Kim Tay welcome to the episode uh Tay Kim Tay welcome to the podcast thanks for having me Eric burn podcast thanks for having me Eric burn it's great to here burn do you want to it's great to here burn do you want to give some context on why we uh why we give some context on why we uh why we decided to have Tay on yeah yeah decided to have Tay on yeah yeah absolutely So So Tay wrote a book called absolutely So So Tay wrote a book called The Nvidia way it's really good um I The Nvidia way it's really good um I just read it I recommend that other just read it I recommend that other people read it and um it is uh just like people read it and um it is uh just like it's a look at at what is an incredibly it's a look at at what is an incredibly important company that um as as you important company that um as as you mentioned at the beginning of the book mentioned at the beginning of the book um it sounds like you were kind of um it sounds like you were kind of shocked that nobody had done an Nvidia shocked that nobody had done an Nvidia book and that's kind of weird like we we book and that's kind of weird like we we use products that are built on their use products that are built on their products all the time and even if we products all the time and even if we don't them directly like we are um we don't them directly like we are um we are all beneficiaries of the flops that are all beneficiaries of the flops that uh that Nvidia produces at at Great uh that Nvidia produces at at Great scale and surprisingly low cost and um scale and surprisingly low cost and um yeah it was I I I find it a really fun yeah it was I I I find it a really fun book because it feels like sometimes book because it feels like sometimes when you read a book about a company you when you read a book about a company you do find they had they had some secret do find they had they had some secret some some concept some big idea that some some concept some big idea that they were able to execute on and um you they were able to execute on and um you you look at a a company like Google and you look at a a company like Google and it's like at every step the question is it's like at every step the question is always where where is the world always where where is the world unorganized information how do we unorganized information how do we organize it how do we make it accessible organize it how do we make it accessible and then how do we put ads into it and and then how do we put ads into it and like that is that's a really powerful like that is that's a really powerful Insight that can show up just about Insight that can show up just about everywhere or you could look at like everywhere or you could look at like Microsoft's early Insight of hey Microsoft's early Insight of hey computer hardware is really expensive computer hardware is really expensive you know it was really expensive when you know it was really expensive when they started it's only going to get they started it's only going to get cheaper and therefore you want to own cheaper and therefore you want to own the software which is this complement to the software which is this complement to it where every time there's a new it where every time there's a new iteration not only is the hardware iteration not only is the hardware cheaper but now there are more users and cheaper but now there are more users and if your software has almost no marginal if your software has almost no marginal cost and the hardware does have a cost and the hardware does have a marginal cost like you want to be marginal cost like you want to be selling the the near zero marginal cost selling the the near zero marginal cost thing and let everyone else do the the thing and let everyone else do the the annoying Hardware stuff and then Nvidia annoying Hardware stuff and then Nvidia does the annoying Hardware stuff like does the annoying Hardware stuff like they they are the ones who are actually they they are the ones who are actually um connecting wires to things and um connecting wires to things and figuring out how many watts this thing figuring out how many watts this thing needs and how much heat it throws off needs and how much heat it throws off and all of that stuff and so it it felt and all of that stuff and so it it felt like like part of your thesis in the like like part of your thesis in the book seems to be like there there isn't book seems to be like there there isn't really a secret like Nvidia it you know really a secret like Nvidia it you know hired hired great people has an amazing hired hired great people has an amazing founder and they just work really really founder and they just work really really really hard and set incredibly high really hard and set incredibly high standards and it seems like they're just standards and it seems like they're just always on like you have this anecdote always on like you have this anecdote about how Jensen his uh the way he about how Jensen his uh the way he unwinds on the weekends is that he pours unwinds on the weekends is that he pours himself a glass of a nice Scotch and himself a glass of a nice Scotch and then just answer work emails for hours then just answer work emails for hours yeah so so tell me tell me a little bit yeah so so tell me tell me a little bit about just you know the like I guess about just you know the like I guess this somewhat rehashes some of the early this somewhat rehashes some of the early parts of the book what was the Genesis parts of the book what was the Genesis of this and you know how did you how did of this and you know how did you think about the process you were as you think about the process you were as you were writing this book like were you you were writing this book like were you were you looking for the secret and and were you looking for the secret and and you know didn't find it or was it like you know didn't find it or was it like like you pretty much had this impression like you pretty much had this impression that no they they just work really hard that no they they just work really hard and um they're they're smart and so that and um they're they're smart and so that that hard work is a lot of Leverage so that hard work is a lot of Leverage so so the Genesis was I got a cold email so the Genesis was I got a cold email from a publisher of May of last year and from a publisher of May of last year and a friend of mine Matthew ball who wrote a friend of mine Matthew ball who wrote the metaverse book uh suggested to his the metaverse book uh suggested to his publish that tay could write the book on publish that tay could write the book on Nvidia my first my first thought was Nvidia my first my first thought was there's no way no one has written it there's no way no one has written it book on Nvidia I mean this is a little book on Nvidia I mean this is a little bit before the AI stuff really took off bit before the AI stuff really took off but you know it the largest chip maker but you know it the largest chip maker by market cap uh as a PC Gamer um by market cap uh as a PC Gamer um they've pretty much dominated the the they've pretty much dominated the the graphics card market for for video games graphics card market for for video games for decades so I went to Amazon and took for decades so I went to Amazon and took a look and I couldn't believe it no one a look and I couldn't believe it no one has written the book on Nvidia and you has written the book on Nvidia and you know there's four or five books on know there's four or five books on Facebook there's multiple books on Facebook there's multiple books on Amazon apple and I just thought for a Amazon apple and I just thought for a sec I could do this like I know the sec I could do this like I know the technology you know being a PC gaming technology you know being a PC gaming nerd and addict for the last 30 years uh nerd and addict for the last 30 years uh I've been for the last 10 years so you I've been for the last 10 years so you know I've been you figure out how to know I've been you figure out how to become a better writer and I know the become a better writer and I know the business cuz I been on Wall Street for a business cuz I been on Wall Street for a bunch of years as a technology analyst bunch of years as a technology analyst uh business strategy so I thought I had uh business strategy so I thought I had the three components to really do a good the three components to really do a good job so I you know quickly within a few job so I you know quickly within a few weeks I met the publisher got a book weeks I met the publisher got a book agent and we're off and running and the agent and we're off and running and the first thing I did was call um LinkedIn first thing I did was call um LinkedIn is an amazing resource for for an author is an amazing resource for for an author uh and you know just reaching out to uh and you know just reaching out to Nvidia employees and within six to seven Nvidia employees and within six to seven calls I realized the big thing that calls I realized the big thing that differentiates Nvidia like you said was differentiates Nvidia like you said was the culture uh it's completely different the culture uh it's completely different from other companies uh the large from other companies uh the large technology companies every former Nidia technology companies every former Nidia employee that goes to a large tech employee that goes to a large tech company like Google and Microsoft says company like Google and Microsoft says it's extremely difficult to adjust to it's extremely difficult to adjust to the culture uh Nvidia is faster the work the culture uh Nvidia is faster the work ethic is is uh on a different level um ethic is is uh on a different level um bur you men something about the the the bur you men something about the the the secret sauce there there's one other secret sauce there there's one other anecdote about when they um acquired the anecdote about when they um acquired the assets and hired 100 Engineers from 3dfx assets and hired 100 Engineers from 3dfx and the 3dfx was the number one Graphics and the 3dfx was the number one Graphics player in the mid to late 90s and they player in the mid to late 90s and they got beat up by Nvidia and pretty much got beat up by Nvidia and pretty much destroyed and the 3d effect Engineers destroyed and the 3d effect Engineers came to Nvidia and were looking for the came to Nvidia and were looking for the secret what what's the secret what's the secret what what's the secret what's the magic trick and then they realized the magic trick and then they realized the only secret is you just have to work only secret is you just have to work crazy and the Relentless execution and crazy and the Relentless execution and work uh the work hours uh it was just work uh the work hours uh it was just working harder so that I think when you working harder so that I think when you look at the nid way I think the work look at the nid way I think the work ethic um you know from the beginning and ethic um you know from the beginning and even today you mentioned Jensen working even today you mentioned Jensen working on Sunday night he loves to work like on Sunday night he loves to work like this is he literally says it's relaxing this is he literally says it's relaxing to him when he goes to movies he doesn't to him when he goes to movies he doesn't remember the movie because he's remember the movie because he's constantly thinking about work so that constantly thinking about work so that Relentless kind of hard work ethic is a Relentless kind of hard work ethic is a key component uh the second component is key component uh the second component is cultivating talent and we could go into cultivating talent and we could go into this later but he's constantly um paying this later but he's constantly um paying his superar his superar his superar Engineers they're if if they're doing a Engineers they're if if they're doing a great job he is going to cultivate and great job he is going to cultivate and retain that Talent by doubling tripling retain that Talent by doubling tripling their stock comp um and and he's their stock comp um and and he's constantly looking uh to hire the best constantly looking uh to hire the best people so when he interviews people he's people so when he interviews people he's finding out who the best person is at finding out who the best person is at their their former jobs um and the last their their former jobs um and the last thing is just speed and velocity into thing is just speed and velocity into everything I I think large companies um everything I I think large companies um when you go to large organizations uh when you go to large organizations uh the internal politics just take over and the internal politics just take over and everyone's looking out for their own you everyone's looking out for their own you know power um backstabbing taking credit know power um backstabbing taking credit uh so when there's new projects new uh so when there's new projects new disruptive projects they just just get disruptive projects they just just get stuck in the quicksand where you have to stuck in the quicksand where you have to get approvals from five different get approvals from five different leaders for it to go forward Nvidia is leaders for it to go forward Nvidia is the exact opposite Nvidia uh Jensen just the exact opposite Nvidia uh Jensen just gets the top 10 people in a room gets the top 10 people in a room including you know the lower level including you know the lower level employees and they figure out what's the employees and they figure out what's the main problem what's the main thing to main problem what's the main thing to discuss has it out in an intellectually discuss has it out in an intellectually honest way and then they move and honest way and then they move and execute that Vision so so that speed and execute that Vision so so that speed and velocity I think they call it speed of velocity I think they call it speed of light uh and viia is a huge uh component light uh and viia is a huge uh component of why why they've been able to succeed of why why they've been able to succeed yeah yeah we um I do want to get to the yeah yeah we um I do want to get to the the world's weirdest org chart um in a the world's weirdest org chart um in a bit but I'm I'm also like one of the bit but I'm I'm also like one of the things you you pointed out that was things you you pointed out that was really striking me because it just really striking me because it just hadn't occurred to me but is of course hadn't occurred to me but is of course true is Jensen's actually one of the true is Jensen's actually one of the longest 10e CEOs of any publicly traded longest 10e CEOs of any publicly traded company like you have Buffett at company like you have Buffett at Berkshire and then I think you mentioned Berkshire and then I think you mentioned one other person um but it's like pretty one other person um but it's like pretty much he's it and um you know was has much he's it and um you know was has been running Nvidia longer than Gates been running Nvidia longer than Gates ran Microsoft and um longer than Larry ran Microsoft and um longer than Larry and was CEO of Oracle um still calls a and was CEO of Oracle um still calls a lot of the shots um and so yeah and and lot of the shots um and so yeah and and you know there's there's obviously going you know there's there's obviously going to be a selection effect where um yeah to be a selection effect where um yeah he has he has great performance because he has he has great performance because you know great performance and a really you know great performance and a really long tenure because if it's performance long tenure because if it's performance really bad at some point the board or an really bad at some point the board or an activist investor would have told them activist investor would have told them to to find someone else but yeah what do to to find someone else but yeah what do you make of that like how you what do you make of that like how how does someone have that kind of how does someone have that kind of endurance and I guess the follow-up endurance and I guess the follow-up question is um if you you have someone question is um if you you have someone like that who has been he was there day like that who has been he was there day one you know naming the company and you one you know naming the company and you know they're like in the Denny's Booth know they're like in the Denny's Booth um figuring out what the initial um figuring out what the initial business plan would be is still there business plan would be is still there today you know on stage and doing all today you know on stage and doing all these events and things these events and things um who who comes next and does Nvidia um who who comes next and does Nvidia does Nvidia have to have a different does Nvidia have to have a different kind of structure and approach once kind of structure and approach once there's someone else in charge I I I there's someone else in charge I I I think part of it like you said is he's think part of it like you said is he's just he's been so successful across the just he's been so successful across the decades so he build up a level of decades so he build up a level of credibility that no one can take away credibility that no one can take away from I mean right now they're on top of from I mean right now they're on top of the world uh it's like unprecedented the the world uh it's like unprecedented the the level of Revenue I think six the level of Revenue I think six quarters ago they're doing 7 billion in quarters ago they're doing 7 billion in revenue and now they're doing 35 billion revenue and now they're doing 35 billion Revenue quarter uh this is hardware and Revenue quarter uh this is hardware and chips this is not software it could just chips this is not software it could just copy the bits over and over again so you copy the bits over and over again so you have this level of success I think he have this level of success I think he just love like like like I said he loves just love like like like I said he loves to work this is his passion nvidia's to work this is his passion nvidia's life he says I love Nvidia over and over life he says I love Nvidia over and over again so if you have that combination again so if you have that combination where he loves his job he works harder where he loves his job he works harder than anyone else he he talks about how I than anyone else he he talks about how I might not be the smartest person in the might not be the smartest person in the world but no one's ever going to outwork world but no one's ever going to outwork me like he just he just had that engine me like he just he just had that engine inside him that is unbeatable so you inside him that is unbeatable so you combine those two two things and the combine those two two things and the level of success he had no one's going level of success he had no one's going to question and no one's going to tell to question and no one's going to tell Jensen what to do uh there was an Jensen what to do uh there was an activist fund uh starboard which is activist fund uh starboard which is pretty famous uh that almost did pretty famous uh that almost did something uh you know my my rational something uh you know my my rational kind of speculation uh talking about uh kind of speculation uh talking about uh covering that in the book but lucky for covering that in the book but lucky for Jensen and Nvidia they they they just Jensen and Nvidia they they they just did big stock buyback the stock popped did big stock buyback the stock popped 20% and Jeff decided to move on um maybe 20% and Jeff decided to move on um maybe history is a little different if they history is a little different if they you know the stock didn't go up and you you know the stock didn't go up and you know he took the gain uh so there were know he took the gain uh so there were times when Wall Street was all over him times when Wall Street was all over him um when the gross margins were coming um when the gross margins were coming down for I this is not just one or two down for I this is not just one or two quarters this is like four or five years quarters this is like four or five years of weak gross margins because he was of weak gross margins because he was investing in the the Cuda cor on the investing in the the Cuda cor on the gpus so I mean a lot of it is kind of gpus so I mean a lot of it is kind of maybe happy accidents but over time like maybe happy accidents but over time like you know he's proven to be able to see you know he's proven to be able to see beyond Corners uh of all these big techn beyond Corners uh of all these big techn technology shifts um all along the way technology shifts um all along the way so yeah that's where you have in terms so yeah that's where you have in terms of um future what happens after Jensen of um future what happens after Jensen the first thing I answer to that is he's the first thing I answer to that is he's in his early 60s he loves his job more in his early 60s he loves his job more than anything he's working harder and than anything he's working harder and just is doing better than ever in the just is doing better than ever in the last 30 years I just don't see him last 30 years I just don't see him leaving anytime soon I mean someone leaving anytime soon I mean someone mentioned Mor hang like worked till he mentioned Mor hang like worked till he was in his 80s so there's still many was in his 80s so there's still many many years ahead uh when he does many years ahead uh when he does eventually leave uh the big question is eventually leave uh the big question is who the next CEO the competence of the who the next CEO the competence of the next CEO and think history has shown next CEO and think history has shown that it could be good or bad I mean you that it could be good or bad I mean you had John Scully was a disaster almost had John Scully was a disaster almost drove Appleton bankruptcy um Steve drove Appleton bankruptcy um Steve balber you know wasn't that great even balber you know wasn't that great even though the financials are better I think though the financials are better I think you know he made a lot of you know he made a lot of mistakes I do I do think balmer's mistakes I do I do think balmer's balmer's underrated but it is it is balmer's underrated but it is it is definitely true that um Gates was just definitely true that um Gates was just uh was a very special CEO I think yeah uh was a very special CEO I think yeah when if you compare gates to bomber I when if you compare gates to bomber I mean Gates is on a different level um in mean Gates is on a different level um in terms of knowledge of technology I mean terms of knowledge of technology I mean you could arree you know B bomber did a you could arree you know B bomber did a good job sort of like Tim Cook like in good job sort of like Tim Cook like in managing the financial aspects in the managing the financial aspects in the business um but yeah that's the big business um but yeah that's the big questions are you going to get like a questions are you going to get like a triple qu quadruple a CEO again or are triple qu quadruple a CEO again or are you going to get someone that's you know you going to get someone that's you know not so good and and Corporate America is not so good and and Corporate America is full of CEOs that are full of CEOs that are pretty I'll just say it they're they're pretty I'll just say it they're they're pretty incompetent um and as like like I pretty incompetent um and as like like I said as of now I don't see Jensen said as of now I don't see Jensen leaving anytime soon is there an obvious leaving anytime soon is there an obvious successor at Nvidia no I mean I I don't successor at Nvidia no I mean I I don't see anyone that's obviously uh up to his see anyone that's obviously uh up to his level um but yeah but but we'll see you level um but yeah but but we'll see you know you never know and you know I think know you never know and you know I think one of the other things that that makes one of the other things that that makes that long tenure really impressive is that long tenure really impressive is that Nvidia is in a cyclical business that Nvidia is in a cyclical business and I it's a it feels like a lot of and I it's a it feels like a lot of maybe the the marginal buyer of Nvidia maybe the the marginal buyer of Nvidia stock right now is maybe less aware of stock right now is maybe less aware of that some been following the company for that some been following the company for a long time but like it it is the case a long time but like it it is the case that sometimes there are a lot of gpus that sometimes there are a lot of gpus just Gathering dust somewhere and not just Gathering dust somewhere and not selling as fast as expected in fact it selling as fast as expected in fact it hasn't been that long since Nidia had to hasn't been that long since Nidia had to take a big write down so um you know how take a big write down so um you know how how do you think about how they how do you think about how they navigated that cycle especially because navigated that cycle especially because it does feel like the vibe in the book it does feel like the vibe in the book is that Jensen is always saying you know is that Jensen is always saying you know we won last time so let's bet everything we won last time so let's bet everything on this next thing and that seems like a on this next thing and that seems like a tough you know definitely if you if you tough you know definitely if you if you get that kind of call right a couple get that kind of call right a couple Cycles in a row it does really well but Cycles in a row it does really well but if there is a long an extended difficult if there is a long an extended difficult cycle um not so good so yeah how how do cycle um not so good so yeah how how do you think about them how they navigated you think about them how they navigated that cyclical like the combination of that cyclical like the combination of like it's a secular growth story that like it's a secular growth story that yeah we will need more gpus over time yeah we will need more gpus over time but in any given year you don't know if but in any given year you don't know if we need you know uh you know 50% more or we need you know uh you know 50% more or like 20% less than than the year before like 20% less than than the year before so so this is a nuanced um situation and so so this is a nuanced um situation and answer I mean I agree with you in the answer I mean I agree with you in the past they've been very cyclical uh past they've been very cyclical uh sometimes uh the Cur the product I think sometimes uh the Cur the product I think Turing and uh mv330 they have a couple Turing and uh mv330 they have a couple really disastrous uh not so great really disastrous uh not so great products uh where a competitor does products uh where a competitor does designs a bear chip than them so there's designs a bear chip than them so there's always that risk and you know the there always that risk and you know the there maybe once every 3 four gpus they just maybe once every 3 four gpus they just don't make a great product um there was don't make a great product um there was this the crypto stuff uh which I this the crypto stuff uh which I actually didn't have time to cover in actually didn't have time to cover in the book and I actually uh in my day job the book and I actually uh in my day job of Barons I was very out in front uh of Barons I was very out in front uh kind of predicting that the problems of kind of predicting that the problems of crypto and ethereum when they when they crypto and ethereum when they when they Chang the the way ethereum worked um I I Chang the the way ethereum worked um I I do think the AI stuff is a little do think the AI stuff is a little different because this is the early different because this is the early stages of a massive computing shift when stages of a massive computing shift when you have the interm CEO of you have the interm CEO of Intel saying uh this is one of the Intel saying uh this is one of the biggest Computing shifts in decades from biggest Computing shifts in decades from CPUs to gpus I mean Intel is the CPUs to gpus I mean Intel is the dominant player in CPUs and the the dominant player in CPUs and the the interm co CEO of Intel is saying oh this interm co CEO of Intel is saying oh this is a really big shift the biggest in is a really big shift the biggest in decades that to me tells me like this is decades that to me tells me like this is going to be a as big as mobile when going to be a as big as mobile when Apple did the iPhone um as big as winel Apple did the iPhone um as big as winel when Microsoft and Intel you know just when Microsoft and Intel you know just rode the PC Revolution for decades so I rode the PC Revolution for decades so I do think the cycle here is less of an do think the cycle here is less of an issue it's it's it's really a massive issue it's it's it's really a massive Computing shift where um we're going Computing shift where um we're going from the CPU stuff which you know is from the CPU stuff which you know is very static retrieval based on on on very static retrieval based on on on files right Windows Server you try to files right Windows Server you try to look for one file to this GPU Computing look for one file to this GPU Computing Paradigm where it it's a completely Paradigm where it it's a completely different time you're basically different time you're basically ingesting all the information you have ingesting all the information you have distilling it into a a model and be be distilling it into a a model and be be able for that AML to to generate a able for that AML to to generate a business intelligence Insight or business intelligence Insight or generate a new piece of content um it's generate a new piece of content um it's completely different so I I do think completely different so I I do think we're still in the early Innings that we're still in the early Innings that this uh this wave Computing shift wave this uh this wave Computing shift wave that is going to last for several years that is going to last for several years but but that I mean if you look at the but but that I mean if you look at the chart of Nvidia did the data center chart of Nvidia did the data center Revenue didn't really take off to like Revenue didn't really take off to like early early last year like the vast early early last year like the vast majority of its Revenue was um gaming uh majority of its Revenue was um gaming uh gpus like 50 to 80% from the vast gpus like 50 to 80% from the vast majority of its life so it's only in the majority of its life so it's only in the last um six seven quarters that that the last um six seven quarters that that the data center part of their business has data center part of their business has really uh taken off hey everybody Eric really uh taken off hey everybody Eric here with a

core Market is Gamers who want to play the latest games maximum resolution full the latest games maximum resolution full detail you know they want the fog detail you know they want the fog effects and the lighting and the effects and the lighting and the explosions needs to look good Etc like explosions needs to look good Etc like somehow there's a transition from that somehow there's a transition from that to like we're not we're not modeling to like we're not we're not modeling this fog in order to make the you know this fog in order to make the you know make Silent Hill look even creepier make Silent Hill look even creepier we're modeling fog because we work at a we're modeling fog because we work at a major lab and we're doing some kind of major lab and we're doing some kind of really elaborate weather modeling thing really elaborate weather modeling thing and I I like that the very very early on and I I like that the very very early on it was basically people tricking the GPU it was basically people tricking the GPU into thinking of something as like like into thinking of something as like like pretend you're drawing a triangle and pretend you're drawing a triangle and then solve this scientific Computing then solve this scientific Computing problem for us and um like that that problem for us and um like that that almost felt a lot like just the way that almost felt a lot like just the way that sometimes human cognition Works where um sometimes human cognition Works where um you look at a string a series of numbers you look at a string a series of numbers and you don't see a pattern and then you and you don't see a pattern and then you make a graph and realize of it's make a graph and realize of it's trending up or trending down or you know trending up or trending down or you know it's getting more or less volatile or it's getting more or less volatile or why is there this weird flip here um why is there this weird flip here um yeah so talk to us a little bit about yeah so talk to us a little bit about how that transition worked and I'm how that transition worked and I'm especially and this kind of Shades into especially and this kind of Shades into the other question of this like how how the other question of this like how how aggressive Nvidia is as a business um aggressive Nvidia is as a business um how how did Nvidia navigate this how how did Nvidia navigate this especially when they they had products especially when they they had products that were meant for these data center that were meant for these data center type scientific Computing workloads and type scientific Computing workloads and then they also have just off-the-shelf then they also have just off-the-shelf much cheaper gpus that were designed for much cheaper gpus that were designed for graphics but could be used for other graphics but could be used for other things that uh a lot of researchers just things that uh a lot of researchers just prefer buy they deeper so you touch up prefer buy they deeper so you touch up on a great point that um a lot of the AI on a great point that um a lot of the AI stuff all the high performance stuff all the high performance scientific research uh it's makes just scientific research uh it's makes just multiplications the same kind of math multiplications the same kind of math and all that calculations and and math and all that calculations and and math is the same math that was in video games is the same math that was in video games like I think I mentioned in the book how like I think I mentioned in the book how for video games you have to simulate the for video games you have to simulate the physics of a bullet like how it comes physics of a bullet like how it comes out of the gun where it lands and all out of the gun where it lands and all that kind of high performance intense that kind of high performance intense Computing simulation is the same stuff Computing simulation is the same stuff you do with science uh you know figuring you do with science uh you know figuring out how a water moves inside of fluid out how a water moves inside of fluid dynamics of a cloud um you know trying dynamics of a cloud um you know trying to predict how uh biological molecules to predict how uh biological molecules would work for uh potential drugs so all would work for uh potential drugs so all all this is kind of uh simulating real all this is kind of uh simulating real life uh physics and life uh physics and that's how Nvidia was able to move from that's how Nvidia was able to move from video games video games video games to Cuda and all the AI stuff uh later on to Cuda and all the AI stuff uh later on it's basically the same kind of math it's basically the same kind of math it's the same kind of physics so so that it's the same kind of physics so so that really helped Nvidia the the funny thing really helped Nvidia the the funny thing is is is um everything Nvidia has learned in the um everything Nvidia has learned in the past in terms of past in terms of business uh it's the same Playbook that business uh it's the same Playbook that they won with video games they're doing they won with video games they're doing to win in data center AI uh I touch upon to win in data center AI uh I touch upon how in in the late 1990s uh Jensen how in in the late 1990s uh Jensen figured out how all these Graphics C figured out how all these Graphics C companies would would dominate for one companies would would dominate for one cycle and then lose their perch and and cycle and then lose their perch and and he he he learned that the the problem he he he learned that the the problem was the a typical chip took 18 months to was the a typical chip took 18 months to develop and ship and then a different develop and ship and then a different Graphics Company would come out with a Graphics Company would come out with a with a better uh chip uh because their with a better uh chip uh because their 18th month cycle was up how about I just 18th month cycle was up how about I just change that to six months yeah I I change that to six months yeah I I always like that like the because it always like that like the because it feels like maybe you know what if feels like maybe you know what if someone at 3dfx has the same observation someone at 3dfx has the same observation of hey our product cycle is 18 months PC of hey our product cycle is 18 months PC Product cycle is six months and you know Product cycle is six months and you know I think for a lot of people they would I think for a lot of people they would say therefore our business is Lumpy and say therefore our business is Lumpy and we're not going to be number one in two we're not going to be number one in two consecutive years and then the Nvidia consecutive years and then the Nvidia answer is hey all we have to do is work answer is hey all we have to do is work three times as hard and then we'll um three times as hard and then we'll um we'll always have something new whenever we'll always have something new whenever there's a new um PC cycle and um it it there's a new um PC cycle and um it it seems like that that worked out well seems like that that worked out well like do you think that was that was like do you think that was that was literally it was that the the chip comp literally it was that the the chip comp the competing companies just didn't the competing companies just didn't either didn't have the the capital to do either didn't have the the capital to do that or just did not have the the will that or just did not have the the will to to work that hard I I think there to to work that hard I I think there there are two components I mean I'm there are two components I mean I'm being a little simplistic when I say oh being a little simplistic when I say oh just go from 18 months to six months I just go from 18 months to six months I mean it was a 18th month architecture mean it was a 18th month architecture but they they created two derivatives but they they created two derivatives that were faster uh it wasn't like a that were faster uh it wasn't like a completely different architecture every completely different architecture every six months but I I think there two two six months but I I think there two two components of why Nvidia was able to do components of why Nvidia was able to do it one is just technical expertise uh it one is just technical expertise uh one of the co-founders Kur Prem was able one of the co-founders Kur Prem was able to uh do this mini kind of virtualized to uh do this mini kind of virtualized operating system that allow them to if operating system that allow them to if they couldn't make a a new great feature they couldn't make a a new great feature uh in Hardware fast enough you could uh in Hardware fast enough you could virtualize that into software and vice virtualize that into software and vice versa so that gave them a lot more versa so that gave them a lot more flexibility than the competitors that flexibility than the competitors that didn't have this virtualized operating didn't have this virtualized operating system where you could put features in system where you could put features in software or Hardware um so and then as software or Hardware um so and then as just the Relentless Drive of Jensen like just the Relentless Drive of Jensen like he like as we as as I mentioned in the he like as we as as I mentioned in the book he is very very tough on his book he is very very tough on his employees especially if they're if they employees especially if they're if they don't come through on the schedules that don't come through on the schedules that he wants so he will dress that person he wants so he will dress that person down um the one anecdote one best down um the one anecdote one best anecdote I have is uh during one company anecdote I have is uh during one company meeting in front of the entire company meeting in front of the entire company he dressed down this uh this manager of he dressed down this uh this manager of the tiger 3 uh Chip he was late and he the tiger 3 uh Chip he was late and he just kept on getting the camera in his just kept on getting the camera in his face like Rayfield you need to finish face like Rayfield you need to finish this chip you're not doing a good job this chip you're not doing a good job and just humiliate him in front of the and just humiliate him in front of the entire company um that might not be entire company um that might not be great that might not feel great but it great that might not feel great but it definitely gets people to work really definitely gets people to work really hard like like you don't want to be that hard like like you don't want to be that guy in front of the whole company being guy in front of the whole company being dressed down so I it's a combination of dressed down so I it's a combination of techn technical expertise and just that techn technical expertise and just that hard driving culture that's driven by hard driving culture that's driven by Jensen so that's why they're able to do Jensen so that's why they're able to do that six months instead of 18 months and that six months instead of 18 months and that same Playbook is being done today that same Playbook is being done today with AI in last October um over a year with AI in last October um over a year ago he said um the data center AI gpus ago he said um the data center AI gpus we're going to accelerate the product we're going to accelerate the product Cadence from two years to every year so Cadence from two years to every year so if you're AMD that's really hard you're if you're AMD that's really hard you're you're behind already but now you have you're behind already but now you have to match um uh nvidia's new product to match um uh nvidia's new product gents and the other part not just the gents and the other part not just the hardware is Nvidia from the beginning hardware is Nvidia from the beginning has invested tremendous amounts money on has invested tremendous amounts money on software they're software drivers and software they're software drivers and from the beginning they sent their from the beginning they sent their Engineers to all the video game Engineers to all the video game Publishers to make sure you know their Publishers to make sure you know their software is working correctly um it's a software is working correctly um it's a strategy they call devs before revs strategy they call devs before revs developers before Revenue so Jensen developers before Revenue so Jensen always knew from the beginning it it's always knew from the beginning it it's really important to make sure your really important to make sure your software is the most reliable the best software is the most reliable the best the most feature and he's willing to the most feature and he's willing to invest tons of money even though it invest tons of money even though it directly hurt their their p&amp;l statement directly hurt their their p&amp;l statement but he knew the secret sauce for their but he knew the secret sauce for their competitive Advantage was going to be competitive Advantage was going to be this was going to be the software that's this was going to be the software that's exactly the same thing that's happening exactly the same thing that's happening with AI right now yeah like I I that was with AI right now yeah like I I that was actually that was going to be my Xbox I actually that was going to be my Xbox I noticed there is this thread throughout noticed there is this thread throughout um throughout the book I guess starting um throughout the book I guess starting maybe a third of the way in with that maybe a third of the way in with that point about how they started just point about how they started just releasing their own uh releasing drivers releasing their own uh releasing drivers directly to end users on a monthly directly to end users on a monthly Cadence rather than just hoping that Cadence rather than just hoping that nobody would ever ship any software that nobody would ever ship any software that would break something um and so you have would break something um and so you have that and then you have the that and then you have the virtualization thing where if there's a virtualization thing where if there's a function that the GPU can't handle in function that the GPU can't handle in Hardware you can emulate the hardware Hardware you can emulate the hardware and then it's it's you know slower but and then it's it's you know slower but it's still doing it's still full it's still doing it's still full featured and then U there's of course featured and then U there's of course Cuda so um it does feel like Nvidia has Cuda so um it does feel like Nvidia has just made this gradual transition just made this gradual transition towards being more of um they're still towards being more of um they're still selling Hardware but more of their selling Hardware but more of their advantage more their lock in comes from advantage more their lock in comes from software software software and um the the fact that people have and um the the fact that people have have learned these software libraries have learned these software libraries and um are used to being able to trust and um are used to being able to trust Nvidia software so which it kind of Nvidia software so which it kind of feels like that has to be a tough feels like that has to be a tough transition for a hardware company it has transition for a hardware company it has because they they feel like their because they they feel like their competitive Advantage is hardware and competitive Advantage is hardware and then they're not really monetizing the then they're not really monetizing the software directly and they are making software directly and they are making this investment that pays off over a this investment that pays off over a really long period so um yeah did you really long period so um yeah did you get the sense that that was actually a get the sense that that was actually a difficult transition for them to make or difficult transition for them to make or was it just like if you have high enough was it just like if you have high enough standards for your product then you'll standards for your product then you'll solve all of these adjacent problems solve all of these adjacent problems because that's the only way to ship is because that's the only way to ship is something that's actually satisfactory something that's actually satisfactory it wasn't really a transition it it was it wasn't really a transition it it was from the beginning uh Jensen and the from the beginning uh Jensen and the co-founders knew the importance of co-founders knew the importance of software from from the PRI prior software from from the PRI prior experiences uh at some Microsystems uh experiences uh at some Microsystems uh for the two other co-founders so it was for the two other co-founders so it was there from the beginning they they knew there from the beginning they they knew over time that was that was so important over time that was that was so important for customers uh one of the coolest for customers uh one of the coolest things after this um during this book things after this um during this book process was having John karmac tweet process was having John karmac tweet about my book uh he he's the creator of about my book uh he he's the creator of uh the two major uh PC gaming um kind of uh the two major uh PC gaming um kind of Revolutions in the early 90s everyone Revolutions in the early 90s everyone that that age knows of Doom and Quake I that that age knows of Doom and Quake I mean those are the two most important PC mean those are the two most important PC games in history and he he said uh he games in history and he he said uh he gave a historical context as he was gave a historical context as he was reading my book saying that uh the reading my book saying that uh the importance of UniFi drivers by Nvidia importance of UniFi drivers by Nvidia like you said was so important like you said was so important because typically before that you had to because typically before that you had to download the drivers from the the PC download the drivers from the the PC graphics card website and then you would graphics card website and then you would have to download one driver for your have to download one driver for your your graphics card model it was a your graphics card model it was a convoluted complicated process and convoluted complicated process and CarMax said uh most of these Graphics CarMax said uh most of these Graphics drivers were terrible like they were drivers were terrible like they were buggy had performance problems so when buggy had performance problems so when Nvidia went with the unified Graphics Nvidia went with the unified Graphics model where you just downloaded one file model where you just downloaded one file it worked with all the Nvidia graphics it worked with all the Nvidia graphics cards and Nvidia wrote wrote the cards and Nvidia wrote wrote the reliable cards instead of you know five reliable cards instead of you know five different PC makers and five you know 40 different PC makers and five you know 40 different graphics card makers uh different graphics card makers uh writing one one creating one file for writing one one creating one file for one particular GPU model it just made one particular GPU model it just made things work like it was a huge uh things work like it was a huge uh revolution in how it all worked and John revolution in how it all worked and John said John Kack said this was a huge deal said John Kack said this was a huge deal uh for the development of the PC gaming uh for the development of the PC gaming industry it was a huge Advantage for industry it was a huge Advantage for NVIDIA for making these drivers and the NVIDIA for making these drivers and the same thing like I said the same thing is same thing like I said the same thing is with Cuda the reason why with Cuda the reason why AI startups and companies go with AI startups and companies go with nvidia's AI Cuda platform is that the nvidia's AI Cuda platform is that the software works it's reliable you you software works it's reliable you you don't want to save you know 30% on the don't want to save you know 30% on the chips but then you put your your the the chips but then you put your your the the fate of your business on on a platform fate of your business on on a platform that has tons of bugs that has that has tons of bugs that has reliability issues you don't want to do reliability issues you don't want to do that um Samy analysis just literally that um Samy analysis just literally wrote a piece talking about how they had wrote a piece talking about how they had no problems uh trying to build their AI no problems uh trying to build their AI stuff and and and test on Nvidia Cuda stuff and and and test on Nvidia Cuda and then they try to do the same thing and then they try to do the same thing on AMD software and it was there was on AMD software and it was there was nothing but problems so if you're a nothing but problems so if you're a company that the fate of your business company that the fate of your business depends on you keeping up with AI when depends on you keeping up with AI when your competitor is working on a an AI your competitor is working on a an AI model or a feature that's using Nvidia model or a feature that's using Nvidia you're going to use Nidia too because you're going to use Nidia too because you can't risk the the future of your you can't risk the the future of your business on something not working yeah business on something not working yeah one of the interesting things that you one of the interesting things that you mention in this is uh in the book is mention in this is uh in the book is nvidia's strategy of um selling into nvidia's strategy of um selling into academic environments where they would academic environments where they would do a grant and it would take the form do a grant and it would take the form you know partly cash partly just you know partly cash partly just hardware and then um people would learn hardware and then um people would learn to build their they learn to do their to build their they learn to do their simulations on Nvidia hardware and I um simulations on Nvidia hardware and I um through the newsletter I do some through the newsletter I do some recruiting and I talk to people who are recruiting and I talk to people who are getting phds in stem topics and it feels getting phds in stem topics and it feels like half of the phds it's basically like half of the phds it's basically it's mostly ml Ops like it's mostly how it's mostly ml Ops like it's mostly how do you get enough time on on a limited do you get enough time on on a limited set of gpus and how do you negotiate set of gpus and how do you negotiate that and how do you optimize to to that and how do you optimize to to minimize the the training cost of minimize the the training cost of whatever you're training um so yeah tell whatever you're training um so yeah tell tell us a little bit about how that tell us a little bit about how that strategy worked and where you think the strategy worked and where you think the payoff showed up so so they did this for payoff showed up so so they did this for for a long time um they want I mean I for a long time um they want I mean I talked to David Kirk who's one of the talked to David Kirk who's one of the the chief early Chief scientists Nvidia the chief early Chief scientists Nvidia and they said they donated graphics and they said they donated graphics cards they donated uh GPU systems to all cards they donated uh GPU systems to all the top universities that did had the top universities that did had Graphics programming um Pro uh courses Graphics programming um Pro uh courses and programs and degrees and they just and programs and degrees and they just wanted the students to build their wanted the students to build their expertise on Nvidia gpus and eventually expertise on Nvidia gpus and eventually all the students will become engineers all the students will become engineers at different technology companies and at different technology companies and they're going to use what what they're they're going to use what what they're used to which is India same thing used to which is India same thing happened with Cuda um David the the happened with Cuda um David the the funny story is David Kirk wanted to get funny story is David Kirk wanted to get Cuda uh incorporated into all the top Cuda uh incorporated into all the top PHD programs and all the computer PHD programs and all the computer science programs and he he traveled the science programs and he he traveled the world and did over a hundred talks and world and did over a hundred talks and speeches to the top people at speeches to the top people at universities and he had no success universities and he had no success whatsoever until the University of whatsoever until the University of Illinois finally told him why don't you Illinois finally told him why don't you teach the class why don't you do it he's teach the class why don't you do it he's like no way you know I live in like no way you know I live in Colorado I have a good life now and then Colorado I have a good life now and then he said no no no no we'll match you up he said no no no no we'll match you up with one of our top professors and you with one of our top professors and you should do it if you really believe this should do it if you really believe this is the future and you really want to do is the future and you really want to do it so he did it he he literally flew it so he did it he he literally flew every other week from from Colorado to every other week from from Colorado to University of Illinois uh they created University of Illinois uh they created Auda textbook and that was the Genesis Auda textbook and that was the Genesis of this Compu uh Cuda program that got of this Compu uh Cuda program that got copied by hundreds of colleges and copied by hundreds of colleges and universities and universities and universities and other other companies don't do this you other other companies don't do this you know we're going to put one of our top know we're going to put one of our top resources have them teach a class at at resources have them teach a class at at at at University uh because it's going at at University uh because it's going to be really important and now you know to be really important and now you know Cuda is the standard that's being taught Cuda is the standard that's being taught everywhere uh so that that kind of everywhere uh so that that kind of long-term thinking is just you know long-term thinking is just you know other companies don't do it does it does other companies don't do it does it does kind of remind me of the the Apple kind of remind me of the the Apple strategy of also selling into elementary strategy of also selling into elementary schools but I I'm I'm of the generation schools but I I'm I'm of the generation where when they were doing that it was where when they were doing that it was preos 10 so I sort of my my impression preos 10 so I sort of my my impression of The Branding of Apple was Apple of The Branding of Apple was Apple Computers are good for goofing off when Computers are good for goofing off when you should be doing your homework or you should be doing your homework or should be studying and you know they are should be studying and you know they are like weird and are missing a lot of like weird and are missing a lot of things that your Windows computer at things that your Windows computer at home has and you know don't see like in home has and you know don't see like in my case my my parents had PCS so you my case my my parents had PCS so you know I could see work happening on the know I could see work happening on the PC I knew that I could play games on the PC I knew that I could play games on the PC and then Apple was this other other PC and then Apple was this other other thing and you know came in bright colors thing and you know came in bright colors and stuff like that this was like late and stuff like that this was like late 90s so um but it did work I mean I grew 90s so um but it did work I mean I grew up with apple twos in the up I grew up with apple twos in the schools and a lot of people bought Apple schools and a lot of people bought Apple because of that uh they yeah like I because of that uh they yeah like I think it it definitely it definitely think it it definitely it definitely worked and then I I guess part of the worked and then I I guess part of the the unique factor for NVIDIA was that um the unique factor for NVIDIA was that um people were doing pretty serious work people were doing pretty serious work and then when they got into industry and then when they got into industry they would suddenly have a much larger they would suddenly have a much larger budget and they'd be making more money budget and they'd be making more money and um it was a you know you you and um it was a you know you you basically get someone wi it is actually basically get someone wi it is actually pretty cost effective to really build pretty cost effective to really build the brand for them and then um then that the brand for them and then um then that brand value is retained later on um I brand value is retained later on um I also want to talk about it seems like also want to talk about it seems like you know a lot of this a lot of the you know a lot of this a lot of the story is a story of technology and of story is a story of technology and of people doing intensive research and um people doing intensive research and um you have some great stories about how you have some great stories about how that process worked and some of the the that process worked and some of the the close calls and you know insights and close calls and you know insights and things like that um but there's also the things like that um but there's also the story of Nvidia as just a a business story of Nvidia as just a a business that um definitely plays hard ball when that um definitely plays hard ball when they can and um you talked about this they can and um you talked about this with scientific Computing where um there with scientific Computing where um there were researchers who said that the the were researchers who said that the the consumer grade graphics cards are consumer grade graphics cards are perfectly fine and then Nvidia would try perfectly fine and then Nvidia would try to say no they don't have the error to say no they don't have the error correction that the Enterprise card is correction that the Enterprise card is you know same thing just much more you know same thing just much more expensive has and then um of course you expensive has and then um of course you say this to someone who spends all of say this to someone who spends all of their time playing around with hardware their time playing around with hardware and is trying to prove true things for a and is trying to prove true things for a living and they will just go out and living and they will just go out and test it and find that no that's actually test it and find that no that's actually not true um and then more recently it not true um and then more recently it seems like Nvidia has maybe not not seems like Nvidia has maybe not not played games with but has um they've played games with but has um they've been very aware of the power that they been very aware of the power that they have to allocate GP have to allocate GP to particular customers and um you know to particular customers and um you know I kind of wonder what percentage of gpus I kind of wonder what percentage of gpus would go to the open Ai and Microsoft would go to the open Ai and Microsoft complex if it was just if Nvidia were complex if it was just if Nvidia were just selling to the high bidder and then just selling to the high bidder and then how much does Nvidia benefit from having how much does Nvidia benefit from having lots of gpus in uh you know core wave lots of gpus in uh you know core wave and Lambda data centers that anyone who and Lambda data centers that anyone who use and anyone can train their models on use and anyone can train their models on I I think those are two two different I I think those are two two different issues um so let me just touch on the issues um so let me just touch on the core weave stuff I I actually think it's core weave stuff I I actually think it's smart of Nvidia to kind of spread the smart of Nvidia to kind of spread the gpus around um I mean there there's more gpus around um I mean there there's more demand than Supply right now and if you demand than Supply right now and if you just give all your gpus to the Amazon just give all your gpus to the Amazon meta um microsofts of the world you're meta um microsofts of the world you're kind of con concentrating that power so kind of con concentrating that power so it's actually creating a more it's actually creating a more competitive market by making sure the competitive market by making sure the the new startups the new companies like the new startups the new companies like cor weave are and Oracle is actually a cor weave are and Oracle is actually a new entrance into the cloud uh market so new entrance into the cloud uh market so but Nvidia kind of spreading the gpus but Nvidia kind of spreading the gpus around is creating a more competitive around is creating a more competitive market and obviously all these big tech market and obviously all these big tech companies like Microsoft Amazon and companies like Microsoft Amazon and Google also have their own AI custom Google also have their own AI custom chips that compete with Nvidia so it chips that compete with Nvidia so it makes sense for NVIDIA to make sure you makes sense for NVIDIA to make sure you know all the power isn't concentrated in know all the power isn't concentrated in the top three largest companies of world the top three largest companies of world so so I think that's one aspect the the so so I think that's one aspect the the second aspect is uh I talk about how second aspect is uh I talk about how Nvidia is the one chip company that Nvidia is the one chip company that always wants to raise prices because always wants to raise prices because they're they're adding value and the one they're they're adding value and the one one executive told me um they're they're one executive told me um they're they're a profit making business their point is a profit making business their point is to make more money but be with that by to make more money but be with that by making more money they can do more making more money they can do more research and development they can research and development they can innovate more and push the envelope push innovate more and push the envelope push the technology envelope more so yes it's the technology envelope more so yes it's a capitalist company their aim is to a capitalist company their aim is to make more money create shareholder value make more money create shareholder value make the employees uh well off make the employees uh well off financially but there there's a positive financially but there there's a positive outflow of that is that they could do outflow of that is that they could do more research involvement research and more research involvement research and development they could do more things development they could do more things that help Society um and there are a that help Society um and there are a couple things that they're really couple things that they're really excited about uh in terms of digital excited about uh in terms of digital biology potentially finding fer cancer biology potentially finding fer cancer and and Robotics and and Robotics so yes Nvidia wants to make more money so yes Nvidia wants to make more money and they'll do what it t takes within and they'll do what it t takes within the bounds of law to to do that um the the bounds of law to to do that um the the other thing is they do have this uh the other thing is they do have this uh really I think different business really I think different business strategy uh which which comes up called strategy uh which which comes up called rough Justice which is a Jensen business rough Justice which is a Jensen business philosophy um which the the philosophy um which the the the the executive Rick Sai who was the the executive Rick Sai who was nvidia's representative at tsmc um told nvidia's representative at tsmc um told me and he he eventually later he became me and he he eventually later he became the CEO of tsmc and now runs mediat the CEO of tsmc and now runs mediat techs he's actually a really big figure techs he's actually a really big figure in in Computing history he told me when in in Computing history he told me when he first met Jensen like within a year he first met Jensen like within a year or two they were having problems um he or two they were having problems um he traveled to California went to some traveled to California went to some restaurant um that wasn't a great restaurant um that wasn't a great restaurant he pointedly told me um and restaurant he pointedly told me um and he said Jensen told him his philosophy he said Jensen told him his philosophy philosophy of business was is was rough philosophy of business was is was rough Justice which meant Justice which meant um in any particular deal or interaction um in any particular deal or interaction they have with a partner or supplier they have with a partner or supplier maybe tsmc would get 60% of the benefit maybe tsmc would get 60% of the benefit and Nvidia would get 40% benefit and and Nvidia would get 40% benefit and maybe another time Nvidia would get 60% maybe another time Nvidia would get 60% the benefit of this interaction because the benefit of this interaction because they needed it we we need this we need they needed it we we need this we need some help and tsmc will get TS um some help and tsmc will get TS um 40% it's just rough Justice over time if 40% it's just rough Justice over time if it's 50/50 over 3 four years that'll be it's 50/50 over 3 four years that'll be great but we have to build this trusted great but we have to build this trusted relationship where it's like a friend relationship where it's like a friend what when I need you at this at this what when I need you at this at this point you're going to help me out and point you're going to help me out and then later you're it's going to be vice then later you're it's going to be vice versa and that's the way he saw um versa and that's the way he saw um business Partnerships and relationships business Partnerships and relationships and that's uh that Rick's I thought that and that's uh that Rick's I thought that was so profound like no other business was so profound like no other business that he interacted with thought of it that he interacted with thought of it that way and then that as you build that that way and then that as you build that trust relationship where you're there trust relationship where you're there for each other at different times um for each other at different times um that's how you build a strong that's how you build a strong partnership and that that's and he partnership and that that's and he called tsnc Nvidia like one of the best called tsnc Nvidia like one of the best Partnerships ever in in business history Partnerships ever in in business history over 30 years so so it's not about just over 30 years so so it's not about just getting every dollar and Penny out of getting every dollar and Penny out of your of your um partner or supplier at your of your um partner or supplier at all points it's it's about being able all points it's it's about being able that to build trusted partnership and that to build trusted partnership and relationship over decades um so I relationship over decades um so I think the Hallmark value of Nvidia is think the Hallmark value of Nvidia is long-term thinking so if you just are long-term thinking so if you just are always about you know getting that last always about you know getting that last dollar out of people you know people dollar out of people you know people won't want to deal with you over time won't want to deal with you over time and Nvidia and Jensen have always and Nvidia and Jensen have always thought about long-term uh what's the thought about long-term uh what's the long-term benefit uh for the company the long-term benefit uh for the company the customer and Nvidia so so that's why customer and Nvidia so so that's why they've been able to just invest long they've been able to just invest long term uh figure things out that other term uh figure things out that other companies haven't been able to do and companies haven't been able to do and think five 10 15 year increments instead think five 10 15 year increments instead of the next quarter or the next year of the next quarter or the next year that the most of um the technology that the most of um the technology industry and Wall Street wants yeah I industry and Wall Street wants yeah I think I think that makes a lot of sense think I think that makes a lot of sense and um yeah definitely the the Nvidia and um yeah definitely the the Nvidia TSM partnership is just really really TSM partnership is just really really interesting and unique because like interesting and unique because like there are a lot of companies where they there are a lot of companies where they they will partner together and it is they will partner together and it is mutually beneficial but each company mutually beneficial but each company kind of makes sense on its own and then kind of makes sense on its own and then with Nvidia and tsmc it does feel like with Nvidia and tsmc it does feel like the the incremental Fab probably didn't the the incremental Fab probably didn't make sense without Nvidia as an anchor make sense without Nvidia as an anchor customer and then the incremental GPU customer and then the incremental GPU doesn't make sense unless you're doesn't make sense unless you're actually pretty sure that someone out actually pretty sure that someone out there can manufacture it and that there can manufacture it and that someone is almost certainly tsmc so um someone is almost certainly tsmc so um yeah it becomes this this really yeah it becomes this this really interesting Mutual dependency and uh it interesting Mutual dependency and uh it is like it's it's fun to look at the the is like it's it's fun to look at the the conference called like Ernie's called conference called like Ernie's called transcripts for for both companies transcripts for for both companies because um Nvidia C like Nvidia because um Nvidia C like Nvidia investors are generally very very happy investors are generally very very happy with the margin picture and then um at with the margin picture and then um at tsmc one of the big questions is always tsmc one of the big questions is always why why can't you just charge them more why why can't you just charge them more why why is it that you are making this why why is it that you are making this uh this little markup like you you have uh this little markup like you you have manufacturing business and you know for manufacturing business and you know for a manufacturing business incredible a manufacturing business incredible gross margins and yet as soon as that uh gross margins and yet as soon as that uh as soon as that product leaves the Fab as soon as that product leaves the Fab and gets an Nvidia logo slapped on it and gets an Nvidia logo slapped on it gets packaged up and put in a box that gets packaged up and put in a box that says Nvidia on it it's suddenly worth a says Nvidia on it it's suddenly worth a whole lot more and um yeah do seem like whole lot more and um yeah do seem like maybe you know a big part of that has to maybe you know a big part of that has to be that Nvidia was there as a customer be that Nvidia was there as a customer and was willing to willing to take a and was willing to willing to take a risk on on tsmc when they just didn't risk on on tsmc when they just didn't have the the brand name and franchise have the the brand name and franchise that they have today so it is it is a that they have today so it is it is a nice story that the conference calls are nice story that the conference calls are really funny because the tsmc executives really funny because the tsmc executives always kind of joke without naming always kind of joke without naming Nvidia they they joke about nvidia's and Nvidia they they joke about nvidia's and margins uh on the calls um but I mean margins uh on the calls um but I mean tsmc is doing great on the margin side tsmc is doing great on the margin side too I mean compared to everyone else so too I mean compared to everyone else so um both are both have it's been a um both are both have it's been a win-win partnership um especially these win-win partnership um especially these days yeah yeah so like a lot of the days yeah yeah so like a lot of the story it is this story of a company story it is this story of a company where they they have a vision for what where they they have a vision for what the product will be they bring together the product will be they bring together the team that can actually realize that the team that can actually realize that Vision they sell that product and then Vision they sell that product and then you also talk about the um their their you also talk about the um their their m&amp;a and that they um you know they they m&amp;a and that they um you know they they do the occasional strategic acquisition do the occasional strategic acquisition like 3dfx had plenty of good good like 3dfx had plenty of good good designers and you know good good designers and you know good good engineers and um VI was able to pick engineers and um VI was able to pick them off um after of X failed and then them off um after of X failed and then um there's the the melanox deal which I um there's the the melanox deal which I thought was a really interesting one thought was a really interesting one because it just it feels like there's because it just it feels like there's this cohort of companies where they are this cohort of companies where they are very relentlessly product focused very relentlessly product focused companies with a really serious companies with a really serious engineering culture and then there's a engineering culture and then there's a cohort of companies where they like cohort of companies where they like strategic Acquisitions and they they're strategic Acquisitions and they they're happy to get mixed up in bidding wars happy to get mixed up in bidding wars and um and then sometimes when those and um and then sometimes when those Collide it's like someone who is really Collide it's like someone who is really good on the technology side just kind of good on the technology side just kind of loses their head on the financial side loses their head on the financial side and overpays for something and then in and overpays for something and then in this case it turns out that they uh they this case it turns out that they uh they seem to have dramatically underpaid so seem to have dramatically underpaid so um yeah tell us a little bit about about um yeah tell us a little bit about about that that transaction and some of the that that transaction and some of the corporate drama there and the the corporate drama there and the the outcome and I guess maybe the outcome and I guess maybe the interesting counterfactual is um if if interesting counterfactual is um if if melanox had stayed independent would it melanox had stayed independent would it be as big would Nvidia have tried to be as big would Nvidia have tried to replace some of that internally or would replace some of that internally or would it just uh would things have just not it just uh would things have just not worked out as well as they have so far worked out as well as they have so far so so melanox is is a very important so so melanox is is a very important event in nvidia's um timeline um they event in nvidia's um timeline um they weren't seeking melanox melanox kind of weren't seeking melanox melanox kind of fell in their lap which like as I fell in their lap which like as I mentioned with starboard before mentioned with starboard before starboard kind of forced the CEO if you starboard kind of forced the CEO if you don't hit these markting targets we're don't hit these markting targets we're going to kick you out so the CEO decided going to kick you out so the CEO decided okay forget this I'm just going to sell okay forget this I'm just going to sell the company and melox went off for the company and melox went off for auction uh Jensen looked at it and and auction uh Jensen looked at it and and and after very short period realized I and after very short period realized I really want this company uh I I think really want this company uh I I think the world is going in a certain the world is going in a certain direction and melanox is going to be direction and melanox is going to be critical to that future so when they critical to that future so when they they actually beat out Intel to buy they actually beat out Intel to buy melanox if you look at the press release melanox if you look at the press release in 2019 when they announced the in 2019 when they announced the acquisition you see Jensen kind of acquisition you see Jensen kind of laying out this Vision I need melanox laying out this Vision I need melanox Andia needs melanox because someday AI Andia needs melanox because someday AI is going to work in these data centers is going to work in these data centers it's going to be spread out between tens it's going to be spread out between tens of thousands of servers with gpus and of thousands of servers with gpus and melanox is going to be a critical Factor melanox is going to be a critical Factor on how that happens that's exactly what on how that happens that's exactly what happened 3 four I mean it's incredible happened 3 four I mean it's incredible like 3 four years later you know that's like 3 four years later you know that's exactly why um that's exactly what's exactly why um that's exactly what's happening with these AI happening with these AI superclusters um and then you look at superclusters um and then you look at the amount of Revenue they're they're the amount of Revenue they're they're generating U they spent like six or generating U they spent like six or seven billion dollars uh for melanox and seven billion dollars uh for melanox and now the Run rate on a revenue basis is now the Run rate on a revenue basis is like 13 billion a year growing at some like 13 billion a year growing at some ridiculous number um so it it l was one ridiculous number um so it it l was one of the best Acquisitions in history uh of the best Acquisitions in history uh because because it it really enabled because because it it really enabled Nvidia to create that whole data center Nvidia to create that whole data center kind of full stack solution with kind of full stack solution with software Hardware um the networking um software Hardware um the networking um just pulling that all together like just pulling that all together like apple does with the iPhone and offering apple does with the iPhone and offering that uh complete solution to to their that uh complete solution to to their customers um but I I do think you customers um but I I do think you touched on a good point is these aren't touched on a good point is these aren't Acquisitions where you're trying to win Acquisitions where you're trying to win you know um business uh a part of the you know um business uh a part of the supply chain like 3D effects did supply chain like 3D effects did disastrously with SCB was a critical uh disastrously with SCB was a critical uh m&amp;a deal for them this is about m&amp;a deal for them this is about technical capability and talent and technical capability and talent and melanox were the best at the world in melanox were the best at the world in infin band and this low latency scalable infin band and this low latency scalable networking networking networking technology and Nvidia was able to get technology and Nvidia was able to get that incorporate it and sell a broader that incorporate it and sell a broader more full stack uh product in the end um more full stack uh product in the end um but they I mean throughout their history but they I mean throughout their history other than you know being very other than you know being very aggressive and high Engineers when they aggressive and high Engineers when they become available they haven't done any become available they haven't done any big m&amp;a um that much m&amp;a I mean they do big m&amp;a um that much m&amp;a I mean they do startups here and there I mean the one startups here and there I mean the one big one they went for which actually big one they went for which actually didn't cover in the book uh because I didn't cover in the book uh because I ran out of time uh was trying to buy arm ran out of time uh was trying to buy arm and I mean can you imagine if if they and I mean can you imagine if if they were able to buy arm uh for the price were able to buy arm uh for the price that they were trying to buy it I mean that they were trying to buy it I mean that's another 100 to 200 billion in in that's another 100 to 200 billion in in value Jensen would have been able to value Jensen would have been able to make um but I mean that that just fell make um but I mean that that just fell apart because uh he Jensen wasn't able apart because uh he Jensen wasn't able to do the political stuff uh with to do the political stuff uh with Regulators at the time and and Qualcomm Regulators at the time and and Qualcomm was actually very I have reporting where was actually very I have reporting where you know the Qualcomm CEO was out with you know the Qualcomm CEO was out with regulators and J some jokes about it regulators and J some jokes about it that you know by the time he got to that you know by the time he got to regulators and the all the Regulators regulators and the all the Regulators were talking through qualcomm's talking were talking through qualcomm's talking points so he he did lose out on that big points so he he did lose out on that big deal but oh deal but oh not not that much m&amp;a in in uh in not not that much m&amp;a in in uh in video's history yeah yeah it does it video's history yeah yeah it does it does feel like uh Jon you know he's he does feel like uh Jon you know he's he has has many many advantages and has has many many advantages and probably getting getting lots of probably getting getting lots of politicians on his side is not at the politicians on his side is not at the top of the list of things that he's he's top of the list of things that he's he's unusually good at relative to politics unusually good at relative to politics is very I mean it's the antithesis of is very I mean it's the antithesis of what he he likes inside his company like what he he likes inside his company like I talked about you know getting R of the I talked about you know getting R of the bureaucracy and currying backstabbing bureaucracy and currying backstabbing internal politics that's what politics internal politics that's what politics is when you talk to politicians that is when you talk to politicians that that's what you have to do and he hates that's what you have to do and he hates that stuff um he hates uh that's if that stuff um he hates uh that's if anyone he finds out anyone that's doing anyone he finds out anyone that's doing that internal political stuff um gaming that internal political stuff um gaming metrics and trying to steal credit from metrics and trying to steal credit from other employees He he'll dress that down other employees He he'll dress that down dress down that person in public dress down that person in public embarrass him because that that stuff is embarrass him because that that stuff is corrosive to him um and and I don't know corrosive to him um and and I don't know if you ever worked at large if you ever worked at large organizations um it's endemic like I've organizations um it's endemic like I've worked at large companies and I see worked at large companies and I see everywhere and where you know 30 to 50% everywhere and where you know 30 to 50% of employee time is spent on internal of employee time is spent on internal politics and and credits credit you know politics and and credits credit you know building Alliance it literally is like building Alliance it literally is like Game of Thrones where you're You're Game of Thrones where you're You're Building alliances and trying to help Building alliances and trying to help each other instead of doing uh the right each other instead of doing uh the right thing for the customer um which in video thing for the customer um which in video calls the mission is the boss the calls the mission is the boss not making your boss mission is the boss not making your boss look good to his boss look good to his boss but doing the right thing for the but doing the right thing for the company and the customer that's the company and the customer that's the mission and that's what you should focus mission and that's what you should focus your energy on instead of playing your energy on instead of playing political games uh to you know try to political games uh to you know try to get credit so your bonus is higher uh in get credit so your bonus is higher uh in the fiscal year I mean that that that's the fiscal year I mean that that that's just that stuff drives gents and nuts just that stuff drives gents and nuts yeah and I think that's a that's a good yeah and I think that's a that's a good jum jumping off point for just talking jum jumping off point for just talking about nvidia's internal organizational about nvidia's internal organizational structure and their their wild orb chart structure and their their wild orb chart where they have a CEO with 60 direct where they have a CEO with 60 direct reports so um yeah how did how dides reports so um yeah how did how dides that evolve and how does that actually that evolve and how does that actually work so he said that the first 10 15 work so he said that the first 10 15 years of nvidia's History they had the years of nvidia's History they had the same political problems um internal same political problems um internal politics that every other company had so politics that every other company had so he wanted to create something that you he wanted to create something that you impeded that and would be more agile impeded that and would be more agile agile he said and so he flattened the agile he said and so he flattened the Nvidia corporate structure most most Nvidia corporate structure most most companies are like a pyramid where there companies are like a pyramid where there there's someone on top of a business there's someone on top of a business unit and then there's layers of people unit and then there's layers of people below him he wanted to structure Nvidia below him he wanted to structure Nvidia that's more like a short cylinder where that's more like a short cylinder where there aren't that many levels and and there aren't that many levels and and that he could reach out to any employee that he could reach out to any employee at any time a key component of this is at any time a key component of this is this thing called top five emails which this thing called top five emails which which you mentioned before um most which you mentioned before um most companies have status reports where a companies have status reports where a low-level employee writes a report that low-level employee writes a report that goes to a mill manager who sanitized is goes to a mill manager who sanitized is that report sends it to his boss his that report sends it to his boss his boss's boss and by the time he gets to boss's boss and by the time he gets to the CEO there's like nothing actionable the CEO there's like nothing actionable in the report it's it completely devoid in the report it's it completely devoid of any bad news which which is what the of any bad news which which is what the CEO needs to steer the company so Nvidia CEO needs to steer the company so Nvidia there's no formal status there's no formal status reports everything is through this thing reports everything is through this thing called top five email where an employee called top five email where an employee and every executive either every week or and every executive either every week or every two weeks writes the top five most every two weeks writes the top five most important things that they're working on important things that they're working on they're seeing in the market what compar they're seeing in the market what compar are doing and what Jensen does is he are doing and what Jensen does is he samples a 100 of these top five emails samples a 100 of these top five emails every day so he he he gets a real time every day so he he he gets a real time view of what's going on in the market view of what's going on in the market what his employees are working on what what his employees are working on what competitors are doing so that helps him competitors are doing so that helps him make strategic decisions on where to make strategic decisions on where to steer allocate resources almost on a steer allocate resources almost on a real- Time basis and because he's real- Time basis and because he's constantly on email like I said he's constantly on email like I said he's emailing all weekend into Sunday night emailing all weekend into Sunday night um asking his employees what are you um asking his employees what are you doing here what did you mean by that doing here what did you mean by that he's constantly sending like probably he's constantly sending like probably hundreds of emails a day he has like hundreds of emails a day he has like almost like almost like almost like a a great sensor system that he sees a a great sensor system that he sees what everyone's doing and and that what everyone's doing and and that culture of employees being honest to culture of employees being honest to Jensen and their Executives they call Jensen and their Executives they call intellectual honesty is part of the intellectual honesty is part of the firm's culture firm's culture firm's culture so it's just faster compared to the slow so it's just faster compared to the slow status reports in a typical company status reports in a typical company Jensen has this real-time view with Jensen has this real-time view with hundreds of uh data points every day and hundreds of uh data points every day and it it just works in a faster better way it it just works in a faster better way for NVIDIA um that's something I don't for NVIDIA um that's something I don't see other companies doing I mean most see other companies doing I mean most companies love to have the CEO managing companies love to have the CEO managing six or seven direct direct reports where six or seven direct direct reports where the chief operating officers you know is the chief operating officers you know is another layer doing all that stuff no another layer doing all that stuff no Jensen wants his his fingers and his Jensen wants his his fingers and his pulse on everything uh all the way up pulse on everything uh all the way up and up and down through the company and and up and down through the company and I think actually the other key thing is I think actually the other key thing is he just has a technical competence that he just has a technical competence that most most CEOs don't have he's actually most most CEOs don't have he's actually trading papers AI papers the latest trading papers AI papers the latest academic AI papers with his Engineers academic AI papers with his Engineers he's on these discussion boards uh he's on these discussion boards uh Nvidia has all these email discussion Nvidia has all these email discussion boards so you know for AI or or automous boards so you know for AI or or automous driving where Engineers trade the latest driving where Engineers trade the latest articles and research and whatever he's articles and research and whatever he's inside these discussion boards and inside these discussion boards and sending the latest AI paper papers to sending the latest AI paper papers to his his Engineers so he had he's like his his Engineers so he had he's like passionate about this technical uh passionate about this technical uh specifications and all the latest specifications and all the latest technology so he's in the Weeds on this technology so he's in the Weeds on this stuff um one guy told me one manager stuff um one guy told me one manager told me like he he was prep preparing told me like he he was prep preparing and met Jensen to talk about Wireless and met Jensen to talk about Wireless specifications for this unimportant specifications for this unimportant product and he knew more about what's product and he knew more about what's happening in the W Wireless specs of um happening in the W Wireless specs of um than he did like he he like that it's than he did like he he like that it's not that important the CEO of Nvidia not that important the CEO of Nvidia should not be you know look looking at should not be you know look looking at you know 802 11b vers n vers G but he he you know 802 11b vers n vers G but he he loves this stuff so much that he knew loves this stuff so much that he knew more about what was happening in in the more about what was happening in in the wireless standards than the product wireless standards than the product manager did so that's that's a special C manager did so that's that's a special C that's a special unique CEO that has that's a special unique CEO that has that business genius and that technical that business genius and that technical acony that um that combination and and acony that um that combination and and just that passion to work 20 247 um on just that passion to work 20 247 um on all this stuff um that that's what makes all this stuff um that that's what makes Nvidia so special and different yeah so Nvidia so special and different yeah so um last one we're almost at time um so um last one we're almost at time um so you've you've been following tech you've you've been following tech companies as an analyst and as a companies as an analyst and as a journalist so like I'm sure you you've journalist so like I'm sure you you've seen a lot of companies come and go and seen a lot of companies come and go and you know looked at different companies you know looked at different companies at different points in their history um at different points in their history um was there is there any was there is there any historical company where it feels like historical company where it feels like like Nvidia is kind of recapturing a lot like Nvidia is kind of recapturing a lot of what made them special when they were of what made them special when they were at their their peak of growth and at their their peak of growth and influence and then are there any influence and then are there any companies that come to mind today where companies that come to mind today where you look at them and you say like they you look at them and you say like they they are pushing that same kind of set they are pushing that same kind of set of cultural norms that made Nvidia what of cultural norms that made Nvidia what it is now I mean two companies I I I it is now I mean two companies I I I would compare Nvidia to or Intel during would compare Nvidia to or Intel during their GL days Microsoft to with Bill their GL days Microsoft to with Bill Gates um and Andy Grove with Intel um Gates um and Andy Grove with Intel um this kind of engineering LED plus this kind of engineering LED plus business genius it is such a rare thing business genius it is such a rare thing um and then Apple with with the Steve um and then Apple with with the Steve Jobs obviously so those are the Jobs obviously so those are the companies I I think Nvidia Compares very companies I I think Nvidia Compares very closely to uh in terms of new companies closely to uh in terms of new companies that they're doing this is always that they're doing this is always harder you're kind of writing harder you're kind of writing reputational put option when when you reputational put option when when you say say say this I mean nothing really comes top of this I mean nothing really comes top of mind right now um yeah like I mean maybe epic um with yeah like I mean maybe epic um with fortnite and all that fortnite and all that stuff but yeah I I don't really have any stuff but yeah I I don't really have any large you know mediumsized that that are large you know mediumsized that that are innovating at the scale of Invidia well innovating at the scale of Invidia well Nvidia is very large now and they're Nvidia is very large now and they're still innovating and really pushing the still innovating and really pushing the envelope so there aren't any obvious uh envelope so there aren't any obvious uh startups or smaller companies that that startups or smaller companies that that have that that style about them it feels have that that style about them it feels I guess I guess that is kind of I guess I guess that is kind of consonant with your with some of the consonant with your with some of the things you said in the book because you things you said in the book because you have some some quotes from Jensen where have some some quotes from Jensen where he he basically says he was not a very he he basically says he was not a very good CEO early on and that Nvidia was good CEO early on and that Nvidia was not an unusually well-managed company it not an unusually well-managed company it was like a a company with average to was like a a company with average to below average management practices that below average management practices that happen to have a lot of good people who happen to have a lot of good people who basically bailed them out from avoidable basically bailed them out from avoidable mistakes so um so yeah maybe maybe that mistakes so um so yeah maybe maybe that is the next Nvidia is that it's a bunch is the next Nvidia is that it's a bunch of smart people and you're always asking of smart people and you're always asking yourself why do they keep making these yourself why do they keep making these mistakes and then you find out there's mistakes and then you find out there's just like a little bit too much internal just like a little bit too much internal politics they haven't quite figured out politics they haven't quite figured out what the right way to structure things what the right way to structure things is they don't know quite how to get the is they don't know quite how to get the right information to the people who are right information to the people who are going to act on it and then once it going to act on it and then once it clicks um once it clicks things really clicks um once it clicks things really start working so yeah but but I do think start working so yeah but but I do think he was being overly negative about the he was being overly negative about the early years in video I mean they they early years in video I mean they they grew faster than any chip company in grew faster than any chip company in history in uh 12 years in um so I think history in uh 12 years in um so I think that's just part of Jensen's he does that's just part of Jensen's he does these psychological tricks with where these psychological tricks with where he's so scared of becoming complacent he's so scared of becoming complacent and being that you know that tech and being that you know that tech company that becomes resting on their company that becomes resting on their Laurels and then some disrupt the Laurels and then some disrupt the startup comes up and you know destroys startup comes up and you know destroys them so he he does these psychological them so he he does these psychological things where the story I have in the things where the story I have in the book is uh they had a blowout quarter book is uh they had a blowout quarter where Nvidia just blew the estimates where Nvidia just blew the estimates away and then he comes into a meeting away and then he comes into a meeting and told his his executive team I looked and told his his executive team I looked at the mirror this morning and and at the mirror this morning and and stared at the mirror and said you suck stared at the mirror and said you suck you
