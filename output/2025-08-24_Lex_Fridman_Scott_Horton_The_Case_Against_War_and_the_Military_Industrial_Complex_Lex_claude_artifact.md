## 1. The Catastrophic Human and Financial Costs of Post-9/11 Wars

***"37 million people displaced from their homes. 30,000 American servicemen have blown their own brains out since then. The only thing we did get out of it was advancements in prosthetic limbs for amputees."***

The post-9/11 wars represent one of the darkest chapters in modern American history, with costs that extend far beyond what most Americans comprehend. According to the Cost of War Project from Brown University, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and Yemen led to an estimated 900,000 to 940,000 direct deaths and between 3.6 to 3.8 million indirect deaths. The financial burden reached $8 trillion, with $2.2 trillion spent on Afghanistan alone and $2.9 trillion on Iraq and Syria.

The human toll on Afghanistan was particularly devastating. Before the war, 62% of Afghans faced food insecurity; after the war, this number jumped to 92%. Children under five experiencing acute malnutrition increased from 9% to 50%. The percentage of Afghans living in poverty rose from 80% to 97%. These statistics reveal a complete failure to achieve stated humanitarian objectives.

For American service members, the consequences have been equally tragic. Beyond the approximately 7,000 killed in combat operations (4,500 in Iraq and 2,500 in Afghanistan, plus contractors), the psychological toll has been immense. Studies from years ago determined that 30,000 American servicemen had taken their own lives through various means—whether deliberately or through reckless behavior like motorcycle crashes. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal have reported on the extensive cocktails of psychoactive drugs prescribed to soldiers, with some taking 15 different medications simultaneously to manage depression and PTSD, many of which carry warnings about suicidal and homicidal ideation.

The displacement of 37 million people represents a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions. These are not abstract numbers but represent families torn apart, communities destroyed, and generations traumatized. The refugee crisis created by these wars has destabilized entire regions and created political upheaval in Europe and beyond.

## 2. The Military-Industrial Complex and the Economics of Perpetual War

***"The worse they do, the better off they are. This is why soldiers in Vietnam called the military itself the self-licking ice cream cone—they cause chaos, but chaos is their job to fix."***

The military-industrial complex operates on fundamentally different economic principles than private enterprise. In capitalism, failure leads to bankruptcy and forces change. In government monopolies on security services, failure becomes justification for expanded budgets and operations. This creates a perverse incentive structure where poor performance is rewarded rather than punished.

Public choice theory explains how the "national interest" becomes subsumed by the private interests of decision-makers. Bureaucrats prioritize career advancement and institutional preservation over mission success. As one example, military officers were quoted at the end of the Afghan war saying they were "looking for other things to do" and planning to "pivot to Africa" to find new Islamists to fight, explicitly stating they were seeking ways to "stay globally engaged."

The relationship between defense contractors and policy formation reveals the depth of this problem. Bruce Jackson from Lockheed Martin financed both the Project for a New American Century and the Weekly Standard magazine while also sponsoring the Committee on the Liberation of Iraq. Defense contractors deliberately spread manufacturing across as many congressional districts as possible—ensuring that every weapons system has components made in multiple states. This creates an army of lobbyists who can threaten representatives with job losses in their districts if they vote against military spending.

The revolving door between government and defense industry positions ensures that decision-makers have personal financial incentives to maintain high military spending. Officials who approve contracts often later take lucrative positions with the same companies they once regulated. This creates a system where the "defense industrial base" (as it's now called) becomes an end in itself rather than a means to actual security.

Lockheed, Raytheon, and other major contractors don't just respond to government demands—they actively shape policy to create demand for their products. As one analysis noted, if they control the think tanks that decide policy, they can determine what kind of weapons need to be developed. This allows them to make strategic investments in weapons systems they know will be needed because they helped create the policies requiring those systems.

## 3. The Afghanistan War: From Soviet Trap to American Quagmire

***"Brzezinski's policy was to support the mujahideen to provoke Soviet intervention. The point was to give the Soviets their own Vietnam—to bog them down, bleed them to bankruptcy, and force them out the hard way."***

The Afghanistan conflict's origins trace back to Jimmy Carter's July 3, 1979 finding authorizing covert support for Afghan insurgents. This was not a response to Soviet invasion—it was designed to provoke one. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's National Security Adviser, explicitly sought to bait the Soviets into invading Afghanistan as a way to inflict on them what America had suffered in Vietnam.

In a December 26, 1979 memo, Brzezinski wrote about how "this could become a Soviet Vietnam." The strategy was deliberate: create conditions that would force Soviet overexpansion, adding "straw to the camel's back" to eventually break the Soviet empire. The United States matched Saudi Arabia dollar-for-dollar in supporting not just local mujahideen fighters but international Islamic brigades, bringing Arabs and Muslims from around the world to fight the Soviets.

This support included bringing fighters to the United States for training by special forces in car bombs, sabotage, and assassinations. The CIA worked with Pakistani intelligence and Saudi intelligence services to build up groups that would later become America's enemies, including figures like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Islamist Group, controlled by Saudi intelligence, would eventually merge with Egyptian Islamic Jihad under Osama bin Laden's leadership to form al-Qaeda.

The consequences of this policy extended far beyond the Soviet withdrawal. Bin Laden's son later told Rolling Stone in 2010 that his father was "so happy" when George W. Bush was elected because he knew Bush would "attack and spend money and break the country." The strategy was explicitly to get America to "strap on the suicide vest"—to destroy itself through overextension just as the Soviets had done.

When the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, the Taliban actually tried to negotiate. Mullah Omar had told the Washington Times that bin Laden was "like a chicken bone stuck in my throat—I can neither swallow him nor spit him out." The Taliban had been negotiating with the U.S. over bin Laden since 1998, with Milton Bearden of the CIA reporting that Omar wanted to get rid of bin Laden and would hint at his location. But the Bush administration demanded unconditional surrender rather than negotiation, refusing even to provide evidence of bin Laden's involvement in 9/11.

The war could have ended by Christmas 2001. CIA officer Gary Bernsen and Delta Force commander Thomas Greer (Dalton Fury) both reported that they had bin Laden cornered in Tora Bora with only three sides blocked—the fourth side was the Pakistani border. They desperately requested reinforcements to seal the escape route. Tens of thousands of troops were available at Bagram Air Base and in Kandahar, including the 75th Airborne Rangers and 10,000 Marines under General Mattis. The reinforcements were denied. Bin Laden and his men escaped into Pakistan, and Delta Force was not allowed to pursue across the border despite pre-arranged deconfliction with Pakistani forces.

## 4. Iraq War I: Lies, Incubators, and the New World Order

***"They claimed Saddam had lined up massive armored tank divisions on the Saudi border preparing to roll on Riyadh. That was a lie. The St. Petersburg Florida Times hired a Soviet company to provide satellite photos showing nothing but empty desert."***

The first Iraq War was built on a foundation of deliberate deceptions that established patterns repeated in subsequent conflicts. The crisis began when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, but the context reveals American complicity in creating the conditions for war.

Throughout the 1980s, the United States had supported Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran, providing intelligence, weapons, and even the precursors for chemical and biological weapons programs. American taxpayers bought German chemical weapons for Iraq through agricultural loans in what became known as the Iraq-gate scandal. The U.S. sent Iraq precursors for anthrax and other biological agents. When Saddam used these weapons against Iranian forces and Kurdish civilians in the 1988 Halabja attack (killing 5,000 and injuring 20,000), American support continued.

In July 1990, as tensions rose between Iraq and Kuwait over oil production and war debts, U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told Saddam that "your border dispute with Kuwait is not associated with America" and that the U.S. had "no position on this." She explicitly stated that President Bush "does not want a war in the Gulf." State Department officials Margaret Tutweiler and John Kelly made similar statements downplaying American concerns. As Harvard's Stephen Walt noted, in diplomatic language, this amounted to at minimum a "flashing yellow light" if not a green light for invasion.

However, once Saddam invaded, the propaganda machine activated. The administration claimed Iraq had positioned massive armored divisions on the Saudi border preparing to invade. This was false—satellite imagery showed empty desert. The claim was used to justify deploying American forces to Saudi Arabia.

The most egregious propaganda was the "incubator hoax." A girl claiming to be a nurse testified that Iraqi soldiers had stolen incubators from a Kuwaiti hospital, throwing babies onto the cold floor to die. Amnesty International vouched for the story. President Bush cited it repeatedly as evidence of Iraqi atrocities. It was completely fabricated—the girl was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador, had not been in the country during the invasion, and the events never occurred. The same Kuwaiti ambassador later fabricated the story about Saddam's alleged assassination attempt on George H.W. Bush, which was debunked by Seymour Hersh but became accepted truth.

The administration also falsely claimed Iraq was developing nuclear weapons. While this was untrue at the time, the Israeli strike on the Osirak reactor in 1981 had actually driven Iraq's program underground, and a rudimentary program was discovered after the war. This became a talking point for future hawks: "If the CIA can't find it, that doesn't mean it's not there."

Margaret Thatcher's role was crucial. She came to Washington and, in her own words, gave Bush a "backbone transplant," telling him "Don't you go wobbly on me now, Bush." This personal challenge to his manhood, combined with his sensitivity about being called the "wimp president" by Newsweek, pushed him toward war.

Critically, Iraq offered to withdraw multiple times with face-saving concessions, but these offers were rejected. Noam Chomsky documented at least ten instances where the Bush administration refused to negotiate in good faith. Saddam's final demands were merely that America promise to eventually leave the Middle East and that Israel would someday leave the occupied territories—essentially nothing. But accepting would have prevented the war, which was the goal.

Brent Scowcroft explicitly stated that defeating "Vietnam syndrome"—American reluctance to engage in military adventures—was a key objective. As Bush himself said after the war: "By God, we've kicked Vietnam syndrome once and for all." The war was designed to make Americans comfortable with military intervention again, rebuilding what they called "Marshall spirit."

## 5. The Neoconservative Movement and the Israel Lobby

***"The neoconservatives are the cross between the Israel lobby and the military-industrial complex. They're the eggheads who write the studies about why defense contractors' products need to be purchased."***

The neoconservative movement represents a unique fusion of ideological commitment to Israeli security and institutional alliance with the American military-industrial complex. Understanding their origins and evolution is essential to comprehending post-Cold War American foreign policy.

Many founding neoconservatives came from Trotskyist backgrounds in groups like the Young People's Socialist League and Social Democrats USA. Figures like Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz moved from the anti-Stalinist left to become advocates for aggressive American military intervention. Jean Kirkpatrick, who served as Reagan's UN Ambassador, came from this tradition. Her 1979 essay argued for supporting authoritarian right-wing regimes as preferable to communist ones.

However, at the Cold War's end, Kirkpatrick broke with the emerging neoconservative consensus. In her Fall 1990 essay "A Normal Country in a Normal Time," she argued that with the Soviet threat gone, America should "eschew the burdens of superpower status" and return to being a normal republic focused on domestic concerns. This represented the traditional conservative position—the emergency was over, so the emergency measures should end.

The neoconservatives rejected this vision. The 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, written by Paul Wolfowitz with deputies Scooter Libby and Zalmay Khalilzad, argued that America should prevent the rise of any near-peer competitor and maintain total military dominance globally. This document caused controversy when leaked but essentially became official policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

The relationship with Israel is central to neoconservative thinking. The 1996 "Clean Break" strategy, written primarily by David Wurmser and Richard Perle for incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advocated abandoning the Oslo peace process and instead using military force to reshape the Middle East. The strategy called for removing Saddam Hussein to weaken the "Shiite crescent" and prevent Iran from supporting Hezbollah through Syria.

Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi exile, sold the neoconservatives on the fantasy that overthrowing Saddam would benefit Israel. He promised that a new Iraqi government would be friendly to Israel, would build an oil pipeline to Haifa, and that Iraqi Shiites would somehow turn against Iran. As one of Chalabi's associates told journalist John Dizard: "I said to Ahmed, 'What are you doing running around with all these Jews?' And he said, 'I just need them until I can get my war and then I'm going to stab them in the back.'"

The neoconservatives occupied key positions in the George W. Bush administration: Wolfowitz as Deputy Secretary of Defense, Douglas Feith as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Scooter Libby in Cheney's office, Elliott Abrams and Zalmay Khalilzad on the National Security Council, and Richard Perle as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. They created the Office of Special Plans under Abram Shulsky to launder false intelligence from Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress into the intelligence stream, bypassing CIA skepticism.

Colin Powell called them "the JINSA crowd" after the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. They operated as what Powell described as "a separate government inside the government" run like a cell by Dick Cheney. David Wurmser served as Cheney's agent at the State Department, working with John Bolton to obstruct Powell's efforts to prevent war.

The influence extended beyond government. Bruce Jackson from Lockheed Martin financed the Project for a New American Century, the Weekly Standard magazine, and the Committee on the Liberation of Iraq. This created an echo chamber where defense industry money funded think tanks that advocated for policies requiring defense industry products, with neoconservative intellectuals providing the ideological justification.

Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, himself a supporter of the Iraq War, told Haaretz that there were "nine guys" within a mile of the White House who were responsible for the war. Philip Zelikow, author of the 9/11 Commission Report, stated that the "real threat" motivating the war was Saddam's payments to families of Palestinian suicide bombers—an Israeli security concern, not an American one.

## 6. The Lies That Led to Iraq War II

***"George W. Bush is the commander-in-chief. It was on him. But the neoconservatives were the deputy secretary of defense, the staff in the vice president's office, the staff of the National Security Council. They operated as a separate government inside the government."***

Iraq War II represents perhaps the most thoroughly documented case of a government deliberately lying its people into war. The campaign began immediately after 9/11, despite Iraq having no connection to the attacks.

On September 11, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld told his staff to find ways to connect Iraq to the attacks. Richard Clarke, the counterterrorism coordinator, reported that Bush pulled him aside and said "See if Saddam did this. See if he's linked in any way." When Clarke reported back that there was no connection, Bush was disappointed.

The administration pursued multiple false narratives simultaneously:

**The Nuclear Threat**: Despite CIA assessments that Iraq had no active nuclear program, the administration promoted aluminum tubes as evidence of uranium enrichment (they were for conventional rockets). Condoleezza Rice warned of "mushroom clouds." The famous sixteen words in Bush's State of the Union—"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa"—were based on forged documents that the CIA had already determined were fake.

**Chemical and Biological Weapons**: Colin Powell's February 2003 UN presentation featured elaborate claims about mobile biological weapons labs and chemical weapons stockpiles. Every major claim was false. The "mobile labs" were hydrogen generators for weather balloons. The source "Curveball" was known to be unreliable—German intelligence had warned the CIA he was a fabricator, but this was ignored.

**The Al-Qaeda Connection**: The administration repeatedly implied connections between Iraq and al-Qaeda despite no evidence. They claimed Mohamed Atta met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague (he didn't). They claimed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi proved the connection (he was in Kurdish-controlled territory, not Saddam's Iraq, and wasn't affiliated with al-Qaeda until after the invasion). The Office of Special Plans, run by Abram Shulsky under Douglas Feith, was specifically created to find or manufacture these connections.

**The Imminent Threat**: Bush and Cheney repeatedly spoke of the threat as urgent and growing. Cheney claimed "we know" Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. When asked about evidence, he said the absence of evidence wasn't evidence of absence—a logical fallacy that became policy.

The propaganda campaign was sophisticated and coordinated. The White House would leak information to the New York Times (particularly Judith Miller, working with Michael Gordon), then cite those same articles as independent confirmation. This circular reporting created the appearance of multiple sources confirming the same claims.

Bush himself admitted the difficulty: he told Katie Couric that "one of the hardest parts of my job is connecting Iraq to the war on terrorism." This was a remarkable confession—the difficulty wasn't that the connection existed but was hard to explain; the difficulty was manufacturing a connection that didn't exist.

The human cost of these lies was staggering. Over one million Iraqis died. 4,500 American service members were killed. Hundreds of thousands were wounded. The war cost $2.9 trillion. It created the conditions for ISIS to emerge. It empowered Iran by removing their main regional rival. It destabilized the entire Middle East.

Perhaps most significantly, it destroyed American credibility. When the weapons of mass destruction weren't found, when the mobile labs turned out to be weather balloon equipment, when no al-Qaeda connection materialized, the world learned that American intelligence claims could not be trusted. This has had lasting consequences for American diplomacy and soft power.

## 7. The Creation and Empowerment of ISIS

***"We backed al-Qaeda in Syria. It's not because Obama was a secret Muslim terrorist—it's because he was a secret George W. Bush with allegiance to the American foreign policy establishment's goals, including the neoconservatives and the Israel lobby."***

The rise of ISIS represents one of the most catastrophic consequences of American intervention in the Middle East, and understanding its origins requires examining the full arc of U.S. policy from Iraq War II through the Syrian conflict.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi founded what became ISIS with a more apocalyptic and sectarian vision than bin Laden's al-Qaeda. Where bin Laden focused on fighting the "far enemy" (America) to eventually establish an Islamic state, Zarqawi wanted to create the caliphate immediately and specifically targeted Shiites. His group, initially called al-Qaeda in Iraq, became the vanguard of the Sunni insurgency during the U.S. occupation.

The crucial turning point came when local Iraqi Sunnis turned against al-Qaeda in Iraq. Beginning in early 2005—two years before David Petraeus's surge—Sunni tribal leaders started killing al-Qaeda fighters themselves. They rejected the extremists' brutal tactics and foreign ideology. This "Sunni Awakening" was the actual reason for the decline in violence, not American military strategy.

However, when the U.S. withdrew from Iraq in 2011, the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri al-Maliki systematically marginalized Sunnis. The U.S. had fought an eight-year civil war for the Shiite side, putting Iran's allies in power in Baghdad. The Sunni areas of western Iraq—Anbar province, Mosul, Ramadi, Fallujah—were left as open territory with no effective governance.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration was pursuing what Seymour Hersh called "the redirection"—a policy shift toward supporting Sunni extremists against the Shiite axis of Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. This policy had actually begun under Bush in 2006-2007 but accelerated under Obama.

In Syria, the U.S. worked with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Israel to support the uprising against Bashar al-Assad. The problem was that the most effective fighters weren't moderate democrats—they were jihadists. Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, who had fought for al-Qaeda in Iraq, was sent by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to Syria to establish Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaeda in Syria).

The Obama administration's position was that these were "moderate rebels" who needed support. In reality, as documented extensively, the "Free Syrian Army" primarily served as a conduit for weapons and money that ended up with jihadist groups. Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar was emptying Saudi jails and sending jihadists to Syria. Prince Turki stated that ISIS was "our answer" to U.S. support for the Dawa party in Iraq.

In June 2013, Baghdadi split from Jolani and declared the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). By January 2014, ISIS had raised its black flag over Fallujah. Obama dismissed this as "the junior varsity putting on a Kobe Bryant jersey." This revealed stunning ignorance—ISIS was composed of the same fighters who had killed 4,000 Americans in Iraq, the Zarqawite suicide bomber brigades, what Patrick Cockburn called "the Islamist Khmer Rouge."

In June 2014, ISIS captured Mosul. The Shiite Iraqi army, having little interest in defending Sunni cities, fled. ISIS then controlled territory the size of Great Britain with an army of 250,000-300,000 men at its peak. This was entirely predictable—analysts including Patrick Cockburn and others had been warning that western Iraq was wide open and vulnerable.

The U.S. response was to launch Iraq War III, fighting alongside Iranian Quds Force and Shiite militias with American air power. The irony was complete: America was now flying as Iran's air force against the jihadist caliphate that American policy had helped create.

The Syrian situation revealed the full cynicism of the policy. Israeli officials, including former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, stated publicly that they preferred ISIS and al-Qaeda to Assad and the Shiites. Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., told a conference that "the lesser evil is the Sunnis over the Shiites" even though "it's terribly evil." He was explicitly referring to ISIS, which had just massacred 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets.

The Brookings Institution published articles titled "The Good and Bad of Ahrar al-Sham" with the subheading "An al-Qaeda Linked Group Worth Defending." Foreign Affairs ran pieces arguing for "accepting al-Qaeda" as the enemy of America's enemy. This represented a complete inversion of the stated purpose of the War on Terror.

The human cost was catastrophic. The Syrian civil war killed over 500,000 people and displaced millions. The rise of ISIS led to genocidal campaigns against Yazidis and other minorities. The group inspired or directed terrorist attacks worldwide, including in Paris, Brussels, and the United States.

## 8. Israel-Palestine: The Ongoing Catastrophe in Gaza

***"They are attempting to destroy the Palestinian people as Palestinian people. They have bombed all of their universities and schools, all of their government offices with records of land ownership or family histories. They bombed every last hospital in the strip."***

The situation in Gaza represents what can only be described as an ongoing genocide, with the United States providing the weapons, diplomatic cover, and financial support that makes it possible. Understanding the current catastrophe requires examining both the immediate events and the longer historical context.

The Nakba of 1948 saw 750,000 Palestinians forcibly expelled from their homes through terror, murder, and ethnic cleansing. This created an 80/20 Jewish majority in what became Israel, allowing it to claim democratic legitimacy while denying rights to the indigenous population. In 1967, Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip, bringing another 250,000 Palestinians under occupation while cleansing an additional quarter million from expanded territories.

The key to understanding the current situation is recognizing that Israel has maintained de facto control over Gaza since 1967, despite the 2005 "disengagement." Ariel Sharon's advisor Arnon Soffer explained the demographic motivation: Palestinians were having too many babies, threatening to make Jews a minority in the territory Israel controlled. The solution was to "virtually" kick Gaza out of Israel while maintaining a siege.

Dov Weissglass, another Sharon advisor, told Haaretz that the disengagement's purpose was to "put the peace process in formaldehyde" and obtain a "no one to talk to certificate" from the U.S. Congress. By leaving Hamas ascendant in Gaza while supporting Fatah in the West Bank, Israel could claim it had no partner for peace.

The siege that followed was explicitly designed to keep Gazans "hungry but not starving"—the exact phrase used by both Israeli officials and Walter Duranty about the Holodomor. Israel controlled all entry and exit, all imports and exports, the water supply, the electricity, and even the population registry. This was not independence—it was an open-air prison.

Benjamin Netanyahu's role in empowering Hamas cannot be overstated. He repeatedly told Likud ministers that "anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state must support Hamas" to keep Palestinians divided. He pressured Qatar to give Hamas billions of dollars. In the BB Files documentary, Shin Bet interrogators ask Netanyahu on video why he supports Hamas, and he admits it's to keep Palestinians divided while claiming to "control the height of the flame."

The October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas killed approximately 1,000 Israelis, though Israel's own use of the Hannibal Directive—killing their own people to prevent capture—accounts for at least dozens and possibly over 100 of these deaths. Israeli helicopters destroyed cars at the music festival. A tank was used to kill at least nine civilians in a kibbutz. The Israeli press, including Haaretz and Yedioth Ahronoth, documented this extensively.

Israel's response has been genocidal in both scale and intent. As of the time of this analysis, over 100,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 20,000 children. Entire families have been wiped out. Israel has bombed all 36 hospitals in Gaza, including leaving premature babies to die in their incubators after promising to protect them if doctors evacuated. They have bombed all universities, schools, and government buildings containing records of land ownership and family histories.

The starvation campaign is systematic. Israel replaced UNRWA's 40 distribution sites with just four sites run by a new organization, three near the Egyptian border and only one in the middle of the strip. Northern Gaza receives no aid at all. The distribution system is designed to maximize casualties—Palestinians are forced to walk miles through active war zones, then face invisible boundaries enforced by machine gun fire, artillery, and tank rounds. As Army Special Forces veteran Anthony Aguilera documented, Israeli forces use live fire for "crowd control," shooting at civilians to direct foot traffic, resulting in massacres of starving people seeking food.

British doctors have reported that Palestinian children are being shot with similar wounds to the same body parts—one day all shot in the genitals, the next day all shot in the elbow or knee. This indicates Israeli soldiers are using children for target practice. The pattern is consistent with the Nazi guard in Schindler's List shooting prisoners for sport.

The legal definition of genocide includes "deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part." Israel's actions meet this definition. Netanyahu quoted the biblical story of Amalek—where God commanded the Israelites to kill every man, woman, child, and animal—in his orders to the officer corps. Defense officials have stated openly that they are destroying homes so Palestinians "have nowhere to go back to" and will be forced to leave.

The United States is fully complicit. America provides the weapons, the diplomatic cover through UN Security Council vetoes, and the financial support. This is not Israel acting alone—this is an American-Israeli genocide. The consequences include not just the immediate humanitarian catastrophe but the creation of conditions for future terrorism against Americans, as the occupation and violence in Gaza and Lebanon motivated the 9/11 hijackers.

## 9. NATO Expansion and the Origins of the Ukraine War

***"They promised not to expand NATO. This wasn't just a promise—this was an agreement. We promised not to expand NATO if you'll allow German reunification. Gorbachev said okay. That's a deal. And the Americans lied and broke it."***

The war in Ukraine did not begin with Russia's invasion in February 2022—it began with decades of American policy designed to expand NATO eastward despite explicit promises not to do so, culminating in the overthrow of Ukraine's government in 2014 and the subsequent civil war.

The documentary evidence of promises against NATO expansion is overwhelming. On February 9, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker told Mikhail Gorbachev six times that NATO would not expand "one inch eastward" if the Soviet Union allowed German reunification. On the same day, Robert Gates, then Deputy Director of the CIA, told the KGB director the same thing. German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher made the same promise repeatedly, including at public press conferences with Baker present.

The promise was not limited to East Germany. The initial phrasing about "one inch" was clarified to mean no NATO expansion into any former Warsaw Pact territory. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl personally assured Gorbachev of this, and it was based on Kohl's promise that Gorbachev agreed to reunification. Kohl immediately held a press conference announcing Gorbachev's agreement, making it a done deal.

The argument that these promises don't count because they weren't in a formal treaty is false. Many crucial Cold War arrangements were based on informal agreements, including the entire arrangement around West Berlin, Nixon's opening to China, and Kennedy's secret deal with Khrushchev to end the Cuban Missile Crisis (removing missiles from Turkey in exchange for removing missiles from Cuba). Warren Christopher, Clinton's Secretary of State, launched an internal investigation that confirmed the promises were made, but decided to break them anyway.

The expansion proceeded in waves: Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; North Macedonia in 2020. Each expansion moved NATO closer to Russia's borders, transforming what was supposed to be a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union into an explicitly anti-Russian military alliance encroaching on Russia's borders.

The expansion was opposed by leading American strategic thinkers. George Kennan, the architect of containment, called it "the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era." Defense Secretary William Perry almost resigned over it. CIA Director Robert Gates later admitted it was a mistake. Fifty prominent foreign policy experts, including Paul Nitze, signed a letter opposing expansion. Their warnings were ignored.

The situation in Ukraine was particularly sensitive. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, and other architects of NATO expansion all agreed that Ukraine required special status. Kissinger noted that Ukraine had been part of Russia for 300 years and that Russian civilization itself began in Kyiv. They advocated for Ukraine to have neutral status similar to Austria and Finland during the Cold War—not part of NATO, not part of any Russian alliance, but a bridge between East and West.

Instead, the U.S. pursued the opposite policy. The Orange Revolution of 2004-2005 was a U.S.-backed color revolution that brought pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko to power. When Viktor Yanukovych, who favored closer ties with Russia, won the 2010 election, the U.S. began planning another intervention.

The Maidan Revolution of 2014 was orchestrated by the United States. Victoria Nuland, Assistant Secretary of State, admitted the U.S. had spent $5 billion on "democracy promotion" in Ukraine. In an intercepted phone call, she discussed who should be in the new government, famously saying "Fuck the EU" when discussing European concerns. The revolution overthrew the democratically elected Yanukovych after he rejected an EU association agreement in favor of a Russian economic package.

The new government immediately moved to marginalize Russian speakers, who comprised roughly half the population. They attempted to repeal the law allowing Russian as a regional language. They appointed oligarchs as governors of eastern regions. Right Sector and other neo-Nazi groups, which had been the shock troops of the Maidan, were incorporated into the National Guard.

On April 12-13, 2014, CIA Director John Brennan visited Kyiv and met with acting President Turchynov. On April 14, Turchynov launched the "Anti-Terrorist Operation" against protesters in eastern Ukraine. This was the actual start of the war—not Russia's 2022 invasion, but Ukraine's 2014 attack on its own citizens with American backing.

The war in the Donbass from 2014-2022 killed approximately 14,000 people. The Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 were supposed to end the conflict by granting autonomy to Donetsk and Luhansk while keeping them in Ukraine. Ukraine never implemented these agreements. Angela Merkel and François Hollande later admitted the Minsk agreements were never intended to be implemented—they were designed to buy time for Ukraine to build up its military.

In the months before Russia's invasion, the situation escalated dramatically. The OSCE documented increased Ukrainian artillery attacks on Donbass. The U.S. refused to negotiate two proposed treaties Russia offered in December 2021—one for the U.S., one for NATO—addressing NATO expansion, missile deployments, and the Donbass war. These were reasonable treaties that should have been negotiated, as confirmed by former U.S. Ambassador Chas Freeman and even some Biden administration officials who told the press the treaties were "reasonable" but were not authorized to negotiate them.

Putin's invasion was not "unprovoked"—it was the culmination of 30 years of NATO expansion, two U.S.-backed coups in Ukraine, eight years of civil war, and the refusal to implement peace agreements or negotiate security concerns. This does not justify the invasion, but it explains it. The war was preventable through diplomacy, but the U.S. chose escalation.

## 10. The Military-Industrial Complex and Perpetual War

***"Terrorism is a small price to pay for being a superpower. That was the cliche in the Pentagon among the joint staff. What are they going to do? Set off a truck bomb here or there? Kill a few hundred people?"***

The military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned about in his farewell address has evolved into a self-perpetuating system that profits from endless war while bearing none of the costs. Understanding how this system operates is essential to understanding why American foreign policy consistently produces catastrophic results.

The economic incentives are straightforward: defense contractors make money from weapons sales, which require wars or the threat of wars to justify. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, and other major contractors don't simply respond to government requests—they actively shape policy to create demand for their products. They do this through several mechanisms:

**Think Tank Capture**: Defense contractors fund think tanks that produce policy papers advocating for military intervention. Bruce Jackson from Lockheed Martin financed the Project for a New American Century, the Weekly Standard, and the Committee on the Liberation of Iraq. These organizations then advocate for policies that require purchasing Lockheed's products. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) was created as a spinoff of AIPAC specifically to provide "objective" analysis that supports pro-Israel policies requiring military spending.

**Revolving Door**: Officials who approve defense contracts often take lucrative positions with defense contractors after leaving government. Dick Cheney went from Secretary of Defense to CEO of Halliburton, then back to government as Vice President. This creates obvious conflicts of interest and ensures that decision-makers have personal financial incentives to maintain high military spending.

**Congressional Capture**: Defense contractors deliberately spread manufacturing across as many congressional districts as possible. Every weapons system has components made in multiple states. This creates an army of lobbyists who can threaten representatives with job losses if they vote against military spending. As one analysis noted, if a congressman wants to cut a program, he'll face constituents saying "you're killing 600 jobs in our district."

**Media Influence**: Defense contractors advertise heavily on news networks, creating financial incentives for media companies to support pro-war coverage. Former military officers who appear as "analysts" on news networks often have financial ties to defense contractors, which are rarely disclosed.

The result is a system where failure is rewarded. The worse the military performs, the more money it receives. Afghanistan was a 20-year failure that cost $2.2 trillion. The response was not accountability but continued funding. Iraq was based on lies and cost $2.9 trillion while achieving none of its stated objectives. The response was to start new wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

The human cost is borne by others. American service members die or return with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. They're prescribed cocktails of psychoactive drugs—sometimes 15 different medications simultaneously—leading to epidemic rates of suicide. Civilians in target countries die by the hundreds of thousands. Refugees number in the tens of millions. But defense contractor executives receive bonuses and stock options.

The ideological justification is provided by neoconservatives and liberal interventionists who argue that American military power is a force for good in the world. They claim that without American intervention, worse things would happen. This ignores the reality that American intervention consistently makes situations worse—creating power vacuums, empowering extremists, and generating blowback in the form of terrorism.

The financial mechanism is inflation. Wars are funded through deficit spending and monetary expansion rather than direct taxation. This allows the costs to be hidden from the public. If Americans had to pay for wars through increased taxes, they would demand accountability. Instead, the costs are paid through inflation, which acts as a hidden tax that most people don't connect to military spending.

The propaganda is sophisticated. Each war is sold through emotional manipulation—babies thrown from incubators, weapons of mass destruction, humanitarian intervention, spreading democracy. The media amplifies these narratives without critical examination. By the time the lies are exposed, the war is already underway and criticism is framed as "not supporting the troops."

The system is designed to be self-perpetuating. As long as there are threats (real or manufactured), there's justification for military spending. If threats don't exist, they can be created through provocative policies that generate enemies. The War on Terror is the perfect example—policies that create terrorists are used to justify more military spending to fight terrorism.

Breaking this cycle requires recognizing that the military-industrial complex is not serving American security interests—it's serving its own institutional and financial interests. The solution is not better management or smarter interventions, but a fundamental reorientation toward non-intervention and defensive military posture.

## 11. The Path Forward: Non-Intervention and Peace

***"We could have abandoned the entire empire, been a normal country in a normal time, stayed out of all the world's conflicts, perfected our republic to the best of our ability, made political and individual liberty our highest political goal, and shown the world how it's done."***

The alternative to perpetual war is not isolationism or weakness—it is a return to the founding principles of the American republic. George Washington's Farewell Address warned against "entangling alliances with any portion of the foreign world" because such alliances would create "unnatural passionate attachments" to foreign interests that would divide Americans and ultimately lead to foreign powers controlling American policy.

The libertarian non-interventionist position is not based on pacifism or indifference to suffering in the world. It's based on several key principles:

**Sovereignty and Self-Determination**: Nations have the right to determine their own governments and policies without foreign interference. American intervention, even when well-intentioned, violates this principle and typically makes situations worse. The people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen did not ask for American intervention, and they have not benefited from it.

**Blowback**: Interventionist policies create enemies and generate terrorism. The 9/11 attacks were motivated by American military presence in Saudi Arabia, support for Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and sanctions on Iraq. Continuing these policies generates more terrorism, not less. Every drone strike that kills civilians creates new terrorists. Every occupation radicalizes populations.

**Constitutional Limits**: The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, not the President. The post-World War II era of presidential wars is unconstitutional. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after 9/11 has been used to justify military action in dozens of countries against groups that didn't exist in 2001. This is a complete abdication of Congressional responsibility.

**Economic Cost**: Military spending diverts resources from productive uses. As Eisenhower said in his "Cross of Iron" speech, every bomber built is theft from those who hunger and are not fed. The $8 trillion spent on post-9/11 wars could have rebuilt American infrastructure, funded education, or simply been left in the pockets of taxpayers to invest as they saw fit.

**Moral Responsibility**: Americans bear moral responsibility for the actions of their government. When the U.S. military kills civilians, Americans are complicit. When the U.S. supports Saudi Arabia's genocide in Yemen or Israel's genocide in Gaza, Americans are complicit. This is not abstract—these are real human beings being killed with American weapons and American money.

The practical application of non-interventionism would involve several steps:

**End All Offensive Wars**: Immediately cease military operations in Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and anywhere else American forces are engaged in combat operations not directly related to defending American territory.

**Close Overseas Bases**: The U.S. maintains approximately 800 military bases in over 70 countries. These bases exist to project power, not to defend America. They should be closed and the troops brought home.

**End Military Aid**: Stop providing weapons and funding to foreign governments, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ukraine. Let these countries defend themselves or negotiate peace with their neighbors.

**Restore Congressional War Powers**: Repeal the 2001 AUMF and require explicit Congressional declarations of war for any military action. Make it politically costly for politicians to support wars by forcing them to vote publicly and be held accountable.

**Dismantle the Military-Industrial Complex**: Break up defense contractors, ban the revolving door between government and defense industry, and redirect military spending to defensive capabilities only.

**Pursue Diplomacy**: Negotiate with adversaries rather than threatening them. Trump's instinct to meet with Kim Jong-un, Putin, and others was correct, even if the execution was flawed. Diplomacy requires recognizing that other nations have legitimate security interests that must be addressed.

**Nuclear Disarmament**: Work toward the elimination of nuclear weapons through verifiable treaties. The current arsenal of thousands of warheads serves no defensive purpose and creates existential risk.

The objection to non-interventionism is always the same: "But what about Hitler?" or "What about genocide?" The response is that American intervention has not prevented genocide—it has often caused it. The sanctions on Iraq killed hundreds of thousands. The invasion of Iraq killed over a million. The intervention in Libya created a failed state and slave markets. The intervention in Syria empowered ISIS. The support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen has created famine.

The world does not need an American empire to maintain order. Most nations have no interest in conquering their neighbors. Trade and economic interdependence create incentives for peace. Regional powers can balance each other without American involvement. The idea that without American intervention, the world would descend into chaos is propaganda designed to justify the empire.

The American people have been lied to repeatedly about the necessity and benefits of intervention. They were told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction—a lie. They were told Afghanistan was about fighting terrorism—it became a 20-year nation-building disaster. They were told Libya was about preventing genocide—it created a failed state. They were told Syria was about chemical weapons—it became a proxy war empowering jihadists.

The pattern is clear: the government lies to start wars, the wars fail to achieve their stated objectives, the costs are enormous in blood and treasure, and the military-industrial complex profits. The solution is not better lies or smarter wars—it's ending the wars and returning to a foreign policy based on peace, trade, and non-intervention.

This is not idealism—it's realism. The current policy is unsustainable. The national debt exceeds $35 trillion, much of it due to military spending. The dollar's status as reserve currency is threatened by endless money printing to fund wars. American soft power has been destroyed by hypocrisy and lies. The military is stretched thin and recruitment is declining.

The choice is clear: continue down the path of empire until economic collapse and potential nuclear war, or return to the principles of the founders and become a normal country focused on liberty and prosperity at home. The latter is not only morally right—it's the only path that leads to actual security and peace.
