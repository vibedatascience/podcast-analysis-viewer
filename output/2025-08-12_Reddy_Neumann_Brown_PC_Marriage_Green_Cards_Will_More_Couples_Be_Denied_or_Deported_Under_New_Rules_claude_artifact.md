## 1. Marriage-Based Green Card Policy Changes

***"USCIS now says that if the USCIS finds that the person is not maintaining the status or out of status, they can issue a notice to appear and the case will complicate it where the person has to go to the immigration court and request the immigration court to put it back to USCIS."***

USCIS has implemented stricter requirements for proving genuine marriages in green card applications. The agency has categorized certain aspects that will automatically trigger interview requirements. Previously, individuals who were out of status could still obtain green cards through marriage to US citizens if the marriage was genuine. The new policy allows USCIS to issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) when they find someone is out of status or not maintaining status, even in genuine marriage cases.

This creates a complicated and expensive process where individuals must go to immigration court, potentially face temporary detention until an immigration judge grants bail, then request the court to remand the case back to USCIS for adjudication. The cost of this process is estimated to be three to five times more expensive than the standard adjustment of status process. The administration has allocated $110 billion in the budget bill for immigration enforcement, which is being used to create these additional hurdles even for genuine marriages.

## 2. Notice to Appear for H-1B Workers

***"The people who are on H1B who got laid off and who have either moved to H4 or filed the B2 or filed the H-1B transfer or on adjustment of status and in one case the person even left the country they were been issued a notice to appear even though they have taken the corrective action within 60 days."***

Approximately 2-3% of laid-off H-1B workers are receiving Notices to Appear, even when they've taken corrective action within the 60-day grace period. This includes workers who have filed for H-4 status, B-2 visitor status, H-1B transfers, adjustment of status applications, or even those who have already left the country. The NTAs are being issued because when companies terminate H-1B employees, they are required by Department of Labor regulations to notify USCIS, which automatically revokes the H-1B petition.

USCIS's system flags these revocations and issues NTAs despite individuals being in their legal 60-day grace period. Immigration judges are dismissing these cases, but the process is expensive and stressful for affected individuals. The issuance of NTAs has slowed down recently, with most recent notices being from mid-July rather than current week issuances. There is no way to completely avoid receiving an NTA - it appears to be random selection affecting a small percentage of laid-off workers.

## 3. IRS Payroll Records and USCIS Scrutiny

***"President Trump just fired the IRS head, partially because they didn't want to turn over certain tax records to immigration."***

The Trump administration fired the IRS chief for refusing to share payroll records with immigration authorities. USCIS is actively seeking access to IRS payroll records to verify employment information for STEM extension workers, H-1B holders, and adjustment of status applicants. Companies that have submitted tax returns with H-1B petitions or in response to Requests for Evidence about ability to pay have already provided USCIS with financial information that is being retained.

The administration is implementing Palantir software with extensive data-gathering capabilities, though the legalities of its use remain unclear. Recent Requests for Evidence suggest USCIS already has access to some IRS payroll records. The recommendation is to assume USCIS has access to all financial and payroll information, including details about missed paychecks or employment gaps.

## 4. The Dignity Act of 2025

***"The Dignity Act of 2025 is a bipartisan bill between Representative Maria Salazar, a Republican out of Florida and Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat out of Texas."***

The Dignity Act creates three major functions: enforcement, family unity, and fixing the immigration backlog. Key provisions include mandatory E-Verify for all employers with higher penalties for non-compliance, assistance for spouses of US citizens, and a goal to eliminate employment and family-based backlogs by 2035.

The bill would increase the per-country cap from 7% to 15%, effectively doubling it. Spouses and children would not be counted against employment-based green card caps, potentially doubling the number of green cards issued annually. For individuals who have been in the backlog for 10 or more years, there would be an option to pay $20,000 to expedite their green card processing.

The bill currently has 21 sponsors with bipartisan support. However, given the current Republican control of both houses of Congress and the presidency, along with the lack of support from immigration adviser Stephen Miller, the chances of passage are estimated at less than 1%. The bill is still in its infancy with no scheduled debates.

## 5. Child Status Protection Act Changes

***"The Trump administration reversed it saying that it's going to be only final action dates. It's not going to be filing dates. However, the Trump administration said only going forward."***

The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) requires four conditions to be met simultaneously for age protection: the final action date must be current, the I-140 must be approved, the I-485 must be filed, and the child must be under 21 (with time the I-140 was pending added to their age calculation).

The Biden administration had changed the policy to allow age-locking when filing dates were current. The Trump administration reversed this change, requiring final action dates to be current for age-locking. Importantly, this change only applies to cases filed after August 15th, 2025. Children whose ages were already locked under the previous policy remain protected.

## 6. H-1B Lottery Changes

***"USCIS or in the first Trump administration tried this rule and it sounds like they're trying it again where it's going to power rank - higher wages for better chances in the lottery."***

A proposed regulation to change the H-1B lottery system has cleared review and should be published soon. The system would implement "power ranking" based on wages, giving higher-wage positions better chances in the lottery. This raises practical questions about implementation, as no documentation is currently submitted with lottery registration.

Challenges include how to differentiate between wage levels across different geographic areas (a Level 1 wage in San Francisco can be double a Level 1 wage in Missouri) and how to ensure compliance without submitted documentation. The regulation was previously litigated during the first Trump administration and struck down because Chad Wolf lacked proper authority to sign it.

The Immigration and Nationality Act requires H-1B cap petitions to be issued in the order filed, which has been interpreted to allow for a lottery system. The wage-based ranking may not comply with this statutory requirement and is expected to face litigation.

## 7. Travel and Visa Stamping Risks

***"Every single day I get a call I got a 221G I got this I got that I got stuck in India... If it is allowed legally to exempt me I probably will go with a gun but it's not allowed legally to do that."***

Travel for visa stamping is strongly discouraged unless absolutely necessary. 221(g) administrative processing delays are common, with some cases pending for 18 months. Both third-party client employees and direct full-time employees are experiencing increased scrutiny and 221(g) notices.

F-1 student visa denials are increasing significantly. By the time 221(g) cases clear, many individuals lose their jobs and must withdraw their H-1B applications. Visa denials cannot be challenged through litigation, leaving affected individuals with no recourse.

Immigration judges who were Biden administration appointees or Obama holdovers have been fired and replaced with judges aligned with current administration thinking. This same pressure may affect consular officers making visa decisions. Even high-salary positions with major companies are facing denials, attributed to anti-immigration sentiment and jealousy over high salaries.

## 8. Working Remotely from India

***"When you are outside of the United States, the H-1B, you're not on H-1B anymore... there is nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act or any regulation or any interpretation of the statute or regulation."***

US immigration law does not apply outside US borders. Indian nationals can legally work in India without any US work authorization requirements. The H-1B is only for working within the United States, and there are no restrictions on working abroad while maintaining H-1B status.

Time spent working outside the US can be recaptured and added back to the six-year H-1B limit, even if the person continued working for their US employer and receiving salary. Reports of denials at Abu Dhabi consulate for working remotely from India are considered unsubstantiated rumors or actions by misinformed officers.

Recent examples include an individual who worked from India from April to August 2025 and returned without any issues at the port of entry. A letter explaining remote work circumstances was prepared but never requested.

## 9. H4 EAD Strategy

***"What I strongly recommend people is that to file the H4 EAD way in advance. Let's say for example your 6 years H1B is expiring in June of 2026. Is this a right time for you to file the H4 EAD? Absolutely it's the right time."***

Filing for H4 EAD should be done well in advance of H-1B expiration. For those whose H-1B expires in June 2026, filing now is recommended if the spouse's H-1B expires in 2027 or 2028. Approximately 95% of H4 and EAD applications are approved together.

For the 5% of cases where H4 is approved but EAD is not, individuals can travel to Mexico for a "margarita switch" back to H-1B, then switch to H4 once the EAD is approved. Waiting until close to H-1B expiration creates problems if the person doesn't have a PERM application pending for over one year, as they must stop working when the H-1B expires.

## 10. Additional Immigration Updates

***"Online case status doesn't mean anything. In fact, USCIS, I think, used to have a disclaimer that said it has no legal value."***

Online case status updates have no legal consequence - only the physical approval notice governs status changes. Individuals should wait for the actual approval notice before making employment changes based on status approvals.

Green card holders can freely travel and work abroad without affecting their status, unlike H-1B holders or adjustment of status applicants. Day trading and investment activities are permitted for H-1B holders as passive income activities.

Traffic tickets and minor violations do not affect citizenship applications if properly resolved through payment or dismissal. Problems only arise when tickets are ignored and result in arrest warrants. Global Entry interviews are generally safe to attend unless there are outstanding warrants.
