For a quarter century, Washington policymakers made a strategic bet on India premised on the belief that shared values, shared interests, and a shared strategic convergence in Asia would bind these two countries together as ‘natural allies’ in the twenty-first century. 

All of this optimistic talk came crashing down to Earth a few months ago with the Trump administration’s decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on Indian exports. This was exacerbated by a second decision to add an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its import of Russia oil. 

Taken together, these policy measures plunged U.S.-India relations into their most significant crisis since the late 1990s and the era of U.S. sanctions on India in the wake of the latter’s nuclear tests.

----------------------------------------
President Trump does not quite believe in great power competition and so he does not see India's importance in the US calculus in a way that his predecessors did. Anna Basher. >> The most unpredictable >> becomes a headline. >> The most volatile, >> outrageous behavior, >> unsubstantiated narratives, a battle of personalities. >> Welcome to Grand Theash, a co-production of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Himusan Times. I'm your host, Milan Bashan. For a quarter century, Washington policymakers made a strategic bet on India, premised on the belief that shared values, shared interest, and a shared strategic convergence in Asia would bind these two countries together as natural allies in the 21st century. All this optimistic talk came crashing down to earth a few months ago with the Trump administration's decision to slap 25% tariffs on Indian exports. This was exacerbated by a second decision to add an additional 25% tariff on India for its import of Russian oil. Taken together, these policy measures plunged US India relations into their most significant crisis since the late 1990s when the US sanctioned India in the aftermath of the 1998 nuclear tests. How did we get here? Where are we now? And where might we be going? These are the questions I'd like to ask my guest and friend on today's show, Ashley J. Telis. Ashley is the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs, Carnegie Endowment. He is well known to Grand Theas listeners as one of the clearest, wisest, saneest voices on South Asia and US India relations more specifically. I'm very pleased to welcome him back to the show. Thanks for joining me. >> Thank you, Melan. It's always great to be back. >> I want to ask you about what probably feels like ancient history to you, which is an essay you wrote in 2019 with former ambassador to India, Bob Blackwell, your colleague. Uh, in this piece, which we will link to, you articulated, I thought very clearly, what you described as a US policy of strategic altruism towards India. And I just want to quote um some of that history. You said generous US policies were not merely a favor to New Delhi. They were a conscious exercise of strategic altruism. When contemplating various forms of political support for India, US leaders did not ask what can India do for us. They hoped that India's upward trajectory would shift the Asian balance of power in ways favorable to the United States. Now, some people I've realized in recent days have taken issue with this idea of strategic altruism because they say no country behaves altruistically. They're driven by a hard-nosed pursuit of national interest. How do you square those two? >> I think it's a mistake to think that the United States did not uh do this out of self-interest. It did. But focusing on the noun altruism to the neglect of the adjective strategic is what gets us into these conundrums. Of course, we were very careful to make the point particularly within internal audiences in the government when we were proposing this definition of how to think about India. We were very careful to make the point that this is ultimately in America's interest. And so it was a question of how do you understand that interest and we understood that interest in two ways. One the objective changes that US policy towards India could make to the shape of the larger balance of power which was in America's interest and two a very conscious effort to move away from what academics call specific reciprocity. to something that was more akin to diffuse reciprocity. So there was never the view that we were doing this as an act of charity >> for the goodness of our own hearts. >> Yes, it was not an act of charity. But we did take difficult decisions without asking what the immediate payoffs would be. And the US India civil nuclear deal was a classic example where we need not have done it. I mean that's something people forget that the Bush administration need not have done it. But it did it because it believed one it would be a door opener to a much more vibrant relationship than would have been the case otherwise. And two, because we objectively thought that if India had access to more and more US high technology and nuclear energy technologies were just the beginning, it would give India that additional lift in order to propel its own ascendancy. So I will be the first to admit that there was definitely a uh self-interested calculation. Uh but we thought that both sides would come out the better for it and I think that is strategic altruism right it doesn't ask India for repayment it just looks carefully at the fact that India will be transformed in this process including in its relationship with us as being the payoff. >> Right? So that was then I want to bring us to now. If you go around town as we all do and you ask any South Asia watcher, how did we arrive at this Nadier in US India relations? You'll have any number of theories and explanations. You're a University of Chicago man. You believe in breaking things down to first principles. What is the most parsimonious explanation of how we got to where we are today? So I think the most parimonious explanation is to look at the interaction of structure and individual decision-m and there are changes at both ends. When it comes to structure I think you are looking at an administration that has a very different view of the world. It doesn't think of the world in terms of conventional geopolitics. The big bet we made of on India was in the context of a world of great power competition and in that world we saw India as being a natural ally and strategic altruism followed from that calculation. I think the Trump administration or at least President Trump I should be careful President Trump does not quite believe in great power competition and so he does not see India's importance in the US calculus in a way that his predecessors did or for that matter in a way that he did in his first term right so that has changed as far as structure goes >> and then of course when it comes to individual decisions >> he is a larger than-l life personality who calls the shots on everything his administration does and in the last 3 months he made certain decisions entirely almost as an act of personal whim and that is really what accounts for where we ended up. So India's dropping in importance because of the absence of that structural constraint, the constraint to preserve a balance of power in Asia. And then President Trump's own personality where decisions were made because he felt that he was not given due importance for his contributions in the India Pakistan ceasefire and so on so forth. And it's the interaction of these two elements that really has produced this this outcome. So just to produce one more second, there are some people, and I have to say I strongly disagree with them, who believe that there was an inevitability to the downturn, saying if you go back to the Biden administration, there were visible cracks and so regardless of who the president might be, we would eventually gotten here. You don't subscribe to >> I don't believe that for a moment because I saw at very close quarters that when we had differences between the United States and India in the Biden years, the response of the administration was very very different from the response of the Trump administration. The Biden administration bent backwards to protect the relationship with India precisely because they saw India as being that integral component in great power competition with China. >> And the president I think President Biden was far more careful with respect to how he dealt with disagreements with India. We always kept those disagreements private. We always handled them behind closed doors. And we ended up, I think, with solutions that were more or less good. But we did it outside the public eye without embarrassment either to the Indians or to ourselves. >> Right. And your expectation, I realize this is now in the realm of speculation is that had we gotten a Harris presidency or for that matter a traditional internationalist Republican presidency, we probably would have ended up more or less in the same place. >> I think so. >> Yeah. To me, as long as the United States took its bearings from the fact that it was a world where it would be competing with China, it was a world where maintaining the liberal international order was fundamentally in our interests. As long as we had those two bookends, I think we would have ended up in pretty much the same place where George W. Bush left us. So when it comes to India's current position, you were quoted in a recent Wall Street Journal piece as describing it as in a word waiting and you went on to say that the Modi government has displayed a remarkable equinimity in public while keeping open lines of communication to the Trump administration. Can the Modi administration afford to simply b its time and hope this administration comes around? I think they're certainly trying to do that and they're doing it not simply because of the personality of the prime minister. They're doing it because it is in their strategic interest to maintain every opportunity to protect the US India relationship despite Prime Minister Modi's visit to Tanzhin and all those photographs that were taken with you know presidents uh Putin and she >> I think Prime Minister Modi understands fully that there is no substitute for the United States when it comes to Indian security, Indian prosperity and so on and so forth. >> A trade, technology, I mean the list is quite long actually. >> Abs. Absolutely. Absolutely. And so what he is doing in my judgment is you know biting his tongue, stiffening his lip and simply hoping to ride this out. Now they've done a couple of things which I think are extremely important to keep in mind. They have kept open lines of communication with the administration, >> right? >> And they have engaged in a dialogue very respectfully with the objective of trying to solve the problems that be devil us. >> So whether it's a matter of Russian oil or whether it's a matter of trade, India has been nothing but responsive. And so they are making an effort. they are making an effort and I'm hoping that in the weeks to come we will actually see the early fruit of that effort. >> So let me just pause on a second right because the question that I keep asking myself is if I'm New Delhi what else can I do? I've already proposed tariff cuts probably the most significant cuts I've ever proposed. Maybe not as much as the US administration would have liked to see but you know not nothing. I'm already saying, look, I'm happy to buy more US crude and more LG. I've already intend to amend my nuclear liability laws to make it possible for foreign companies to invest in the civilian nuclear space. Uh I'm buying and will buy more US defense kit. Uh what other levers does India have beyond that? >> Not many. And so what I expect to see happen is a continuation of the dialogue and hopefully success in their attempts at persuasion because when senior officials sort of take the entirety of the US package everything that you described >> and other things too I give you the abbreviated >> list. Sure. >> Take that to the president and say this is what India has put on the table. You just hope that you know sort of visor councils prevail and that the president sees the value in accepting a win because it is a win. >> It is a win for him. The fact that India has moved so far as you point out >> on issues like it has never done before >> to my mind is a win for President Trump >> and he should >> pocket it >> at some point be gracious enough to accept it and it's never the end of the road. There will always be an opportunity to come back and get more because that's the nature of all interstate relations. But there is enough there on the table for both sides to walk away with very pleased at what they've achieved. >> So let's just go back a bit to the issue you raised which is these images we've all seen of the SEO summit. You know there's that famous picture the kind of chummy picture of she and Modi and Putin gathering together for this photo op. Now I find the response to this has been very polarized. You have one set of people who say this is nothing new. Modi had planned to go to the summit. The relationship with Russia is well known and well documented. There hasn't any way been a kind of thaw with China underway even before this president has taken office. But then you have others on the opposite side who say actually this looks like the beginning of some kind of strategic realignment, a reset. Where do you come down on the spectrum? >> Well, it's certainly not a realignment by any means. uh India's relationship with Russia has always been good uh for most part it is a relationship that will remain I think in good repair because both sides have big equities in it. India's relationship with China is improving slowly and the operative word is slowly >> but I don't think it will ever end up in a full-fledged raproma which fundamentally undermines their interests in a robust relationship with Washington >> and so no matter what we saw in Tanjin and certainly the choreography was designed uh to satisfy both Modi's constituency at home as well as to send a message to Washington. >> But that notwithstanding, I do not see any fundamental realignment underway. >> The Indians understand the limits of their relationship even with Russia, no matter how good it is, and they certainly understand the limits of the relationship with China. >> The symbolic messaging to Washington, did it get through? I think so because you saw that uh very uncharacteristically uh um that unar characteristic tweet that the president put out. Oh no, we've lost India and we've lost China and Russia. Yes, that's right. I it sort of almost felt like a sense of posthos, >> you know, surrounding the message. I think I think the imagery certainly hit home and I think it played a role in people around the president asking the question of whether this is where we want to leave the relationship with India >> and thankfully you know it appears that wiser minds prevailed and we've seen some element of a rebuilding in the last few weeks. I mean I have to just pause and give credit where credit is due and I do think that uh we should recognize that the Modi government I think has handled this admirably. Um I am struck by the degree of message discipline the Indians have exercised in not taking the bait and having a rather workmanlike attitude. There have been very few stray remarks >> that would suggest that they've really got their noses bent out of join. I mean, do you agree with that assessment? >> I agree with that completely. I think the Indian government understands full well the stakes in the relationship with the United States and they were not willing to leave anything to chance. And so even though there was a national chorus of disapproval of both President Trump personally and the United States more generally uh the government of India did nothing uh to bait that sentiment and again I see that as part of the very calculated nature of the Indian reaction.

[Music] So I want to uh quote something you said to Bloomberg in a story they publish and we'll we'll link to it in which you said uh Trump is indeed the great peacemaker. He deserves all the credit for stimulating the incipient raproma between Delhi and Beijing. I want to ask about India China for a moment after the Galwan attacks. My sense is the Indian government decided look we can no longer pursue a strategy of economic cooperation and strategic competition because the two are inextricably linked and they've made moves to decouple uh both in terms of trade investment tech and so on and so forth. Today though there's a very different tune being sung in Delhi right which is actually we have the st on the border uh we need capital uh the economy is not necessarily firing on all cylinders and so we maybe would welcome Chinese investment in limited sectors that are not controversial not sensitive and so on and so forth is Delhi in danger of repeating the same mistakes of the past because in some ways we've seen this movie before economic cooperation strategic to competition and they ultimately decided you couldn't basically you know maintain that equilibrium. >> No, I don't think Delhi is on the cusp of making a mistake. I think the reaction that drove the partial decoupling after Galwan was really a function of the poverty of levers that India had. India did not have a great many levers to move the Chinese and so they used the levers that were within reach. But I think there was always a recognition that India simply cannot grow without connectivity to China as an economic partner. Now you have to be smart about how you use that connectivity and I see the Indians being very prudent about it. But in some way the restoration of economic links and certainly the expansion of diplomatic links which we will see uh are all are all part and parcel of the same effort to put a previous relationship back on track and I think India can do that if it is careful uh very very successfully. It is not enhancing its vulnerability. It is simply being prudent in those areas where it needs to protect its interests. It's keeping the Chinese away in those areas where there's really no risk to India. >> It's going to use Chinese resources to build itself and I think that's a great thing to do. >> You know, just on the subject of levers, um I mean, you know, there's a similar question could be applied in the US context, right? I mean there is a reason that Trump has not gone after China on Russian oil and has gone after India which is you know frankly I assume the president thinks that India is a soft target. Does India have levers visav the United States? >> Not many. Not many. Uh I think they recognize when it comes to trade, when it comes to defense equipment, when it comes to broad issues of national security, uh being in the US corner is much much better than being outside it. And I think the prime minister has suffered the indignities of US policy in the last 3 months while still attempting to maintain the nation's self-respect which is really what accounts for the fact that India has not responded to the provocations wherever they come from but has maintained that discipline with respect to messaging and not just in messaging because even in private communications they have maintained a willingness to resolve Trump's grievances. >> So, it's not simply just placating him for the sake of pating him. There have been serious substantive discussions that have gone on over the last 3 months outside of the public eye, which is where they should have been anyway. >> Do you think that Trump it's let me put it the other way. Do you think Modi can plate Trump on the narrow question of US efforts to bring India and Pakistan and that conflict to an end because that was clearly a trigger. There's a lot of water under this bridge. May 10th, 11th seem like ancient history, but it's quite possible that's something the president would still desire. Is the prime minister in a position to give him something there? >> Nothing at all. And we will just have to wait and hope that President come, President Trump comes to the realization that there is really no useful role he can play. Encouraging both sides to talk, that's always a wonderful thing to do. It might even be welcomed in in both societies. The government of Pakistan would certainly desire it. But given that India finds that an impediment or for multiple reasons, I just think President Trump has to come around to recognizing that any overt intervention of the sort that he imagines, he has to recognize that that's going to create more problems than solution. >> But that's going forward. But if we look backward, do you think that Prime Minister Modi can do anything to give a kind of hat tip to President Trump about the Operation Synindor ceasefire? Well, I guess he could do it if he was willing to accept some creative rewriting of history. But, you know, the simple thing that could have been done without prejudice to the Indian position >> uh would have been to simply thank the president for everything his administration did because I think it is simply factually correct to say that the Trump administration did play a role. Now the specific role that the president played is debatable is a different question >> but the administration certainly played a role and from everything I have seen >> it has been a helpful role >> and I think India can you know admit to that role without prejudice to its position that these big issues with Pakistan have to be settled bilaterally. I mean, the simplest way one could have done it, I'm not saying this would work today, would have been in in, you know, shortly after the ceasefire, saying something along the lines of, "We thank our American friends for helping to put an end to Pakistani adventurism." Absolutely. Where you put the onus on Pakistan, but you give a kind of philillip to the United States >> and previously India has done that, right? India has done that in the past. I mean they've relied on the United States to lean on Pakistan and at the appropriate times we've thanked the United States you know for the for for the role it's played. >> I want to actually come to this question of the US and and Pakistan because in any discussion of the US and India right now we can't really sidestep this issue. We've seen uh what I think is kind of a dramatic reset certainly not one I had anticipated in America's relations with Pakistan. is uh likely to introduce a fresh irritant into the US India bilateral relationship. What do you see as the underlying basis for a reset of ties with Pakistan? I mean, if you were trying to kind of put yourself in the Trump administration's shoes, what do you think the logic is? >> I mean, I'm hardressed to find a real logic. >> Okay. I think it's the president's own fascination with uh the praise that the Pakistanis showed in him uh after which was lavish. >> Uh he enjoys that >> right >> and so I think he embraced it and he embraced it on premises that I think will prove not to be true. Mhm. >> So the expectation that Pakistan can service American energy needs is highly questionable. >> That Pakistan can serve as a new source of critical minerals >> I think is again highly questionable. >> Oh and certainly unproven >> and certainly unproven. And I think you know people have looked at these things in the past and you know the answers have been too meager, >> too expensive, not worth doing. I don't think the answers are going to be different any you know this time around and so like so many things you know the president has acted on an impulse whatever the merits of that impulse are he will come around I think at some point to realize that this is not exactly a productive investment and it will taper off. I I have to admit that there is another line that I find a little bit like an expost rationalization which has to do with Pakistan's role in the Middle East and uh the role they might play visav uh the Gulf uh with Israel uh based on their long connections to various governments, militaries and leaders and so on and so forth. Do you see that as being a real justification or this is just sort of, you know, because we're in the business of coming up with analytical frameworks, we've come up with this one? >> Well, it's certainly a creative exercise of the imagination. Um, if anything, Pakistan is far more dependent on Middle Eastern partners uh than the Middle Eastern partners are on Pakistan. And so the idea that Pakistan is a fulcrum either for the United States in its outreach to the Middle East or that Pakistan can independently shape outcomes in the Middle East to the advantage of the United States. I think these are fantasies. Leaving aside the role of the United States which I think you've been very clear that the present government of India would not welcome US mediation and what they see as fundamentally a bilateral dispute. Um and I think that there's a lot of consensus in India certainly on that point. Uh is there any inkling that you have seen postindur that the government of India would want to engage in its own bilateral set of talks with Pakistani leadership? I think they would always want to engage with Pakistan if the circumstances permit but their big challenge right now is that they don't have a worthy interlocutor. Uh they will not engage with the Pakistan army because they see the army as being an inveterate opponent of India and everything India stands for. And I think the prime minister if you were to push him would tell you that he wished he could engage uh Shabbas Sharif and his government but if they are not masters of their own mansions I mean how much stock do you put in that kind of engagement and so this is the Indian dilemma at this point I think they would want to engage but they don't really see a partner on the other side who is capable of engaging in ways that might be productive. Now, this is a problem internal to Pakistan. It's been a problem that's been endemic in Pakistan >> and it's not one that can easily be fixed and certainly not fixed by India. >> Last week, we saw Sergio Gore, who is Trump's nominee to be the next ambassador to India, have his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. You know, as many people will know, he's been kind of, if confirmed, will be dualheaded as ambassador and envoy for South and Central Asian affairs is very vague. Uh you can kind of imagine uh whatever you'd like about what that means. Did we learn anything or did you learn anything from his confirmation hearing from his statement and from the general kind of ambiance atmosphere questions in the committee room? >> Well, nothing with respect to how this role of the special envoy is conceived. >> Uh nor anything that he might want to do. My understanding is that this is still quite vague and the details of the obligations of that position have not yet been defined. Uh there are many dimensions to it including sort of issues of division of labor within the US government itself that have to be addressed. My sense is I can understand people's fear and s certainly Delhi's concern that this might be the spear point of a mediation effort. Uh but I suspect that's not where it'll go >> because ultimately the US will also discover that this is going to be kind of a non-starter >> and I think uh nominee Gore himself uh will not want to put himself in a position where his effectiveness as an ambassador is compromised because there are swolling questions about what he's supposed to do as an envoy. >> I want to just again pause on this for a second. I mean, you served in the embassy New Delhi with Ambassador Blackwell. You've seen that setup up close and personal, maybe more up close and personal than you would have liked. Uh, and so you essentially know how this place works and how this functions as a US embassy and what the constraints are. As you think about Sergio Gore who currently is the head of you know a presidential personnel in charge of staffing the executive branch um a lot of people said well you know he doesn't have any knowledge of the region have any indie expertise but he is very close to the president. I mean how do you see this nomination in terms of where we are today and what an ambassador must and mustn't do? Well, um, he has the single biggest credential that matters for the job. He's close to the president. >> You don't need ambassadors who know the names of the seven rivers of India. What you need are ambassadors who have very good relations with the chief executive who can use that relationship to guide the president's thinking about what his policy towards India should be and that is what uh Sergey Gore is entirely capable of doing. Now there are other things that he should do for success. one I would say is keep the best relationships possible with your host government. Uh it was amazing to watch how ambassador Blackwell operated in Delhi. He kept his relationship with the host government in perfect repair so that anytime he wanted a meeting with any one of the principles, he got it. Mhm. >> And because he had the reputation of being very close to President Bush, he was in the Vulcans group that worked with the president during the campaign and so on and so forth, >> people knew that what he said ultimately reflected the president's preferences. >> Sometimes even when the State Department was not exactly on the same page >> and so that gave him enormous credibility. And then the third thing I would add is it pays to take on board and utilize creatively the professionalism of the people who work for you at the embassy >> because many of the folks have put time in India. they understand the Indian millu and if uh nominee Gore is able to use their skills when he is confirmed as ambassador and gets to Delhi I think he'll really be well served because the one thing I learned during my Delhi years was that the people in the embassy are patriots and they are extremely hardworking and if you inspire them to give their best they'll give you more than their best. And so you just have to have the wisdom to know um how to get the best out of the people who work for you. >> I want to kind of end this conversation by asking about the the future, right? I mean, I think it's fair to say that it is possible, maybe even plausible, that the two countries will strike some kind of trade deal in the near future. It's impossible to say if it's in six days, 6 weeks, 6 months, but I but I could see that being an eventuality. and even see this 50% tariff rate settle at something that's closer to what has been applied to some of India's other Asian counterparts for instance. But it's undoubtedly true that this recent spat has given a lot of skeptics within the Indian environment ample fodder for basically saying I told you so. even if we get through the short-term bump in the road, how concerned are you about the long-term implications for the level of trust between these two partners? So I think it the relationship has certainly taken big hits but it is not irreparable and I think the fact that the Indians recognize that they need the United States for their own self-interest and I hope in time the US will recognize that we need India for our own self-interest. That's the foundation on which this relationship will repair itself. So, I'm not pessimistic about the long-term trajectory of this relationship because fate has bound us together. Uh there is an Asian balance of power that we both have a vested interest in even though we have a bout of strategic amnesia at the moment. But sooner or later, we'll come to our senses. And when we come to our senses, we'll recognize that we are both better off with a strong partnership between our two countries than with a relationship that is floundering on alienation. But the ultimate fear in the hearts of Delhi policy makers is that uh this president or really any US president frankly might make a move towards some kind of strategic detaant with China that would result in the creation of a G2 world. Does that seem like a realistic fear? >> I mean it's a fear that's always at the back of the minds of Indian leaders. But at the end of the day, it it's a matter of what your theory of politics is. If you believe that international politics is ultimately about competition, then I think even if we could somehow concoct a G2, that G2 would not last. And that's really the opportunity that opens up for India. And so if I were in Delhi, I would be counseling, you know, my friends in the Ministry of External Affairs and elsewhere that that's the one world you shouldn't take too seriously and you shouldn't get worked up about. What you need to do is do your best to rebuild the partnership with the US and let the US partnership with China take its own course. As long as we have a robust relationship with India, it doesn't really matter what our relationship with China is. And maybe there's a other step Ashley which you didn't mention which is do the best we can to make our own economy more resilient uh in order to help us deal with this or any other future shock. >> Oh absolutely. I mean that's a precondition. That's a precondition irrespective of the kind of world we face. Right. We have an obligation to our own people. The United States is whether we like it or not a hedgemonic power. It is in our interest to preserve that hijgemony and we can't quite do that unless we keep the senus of our material capabilities in good shape and so yes absolutely we have to do that first and foremost >> my guest on the show this week is Ashley Jaitelis he's the Tata chair for strategic affairs at the Carnegie endowment Ashley it's always a pleasure thanks for taking the time >> thank you for having me is a co-production of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the Hind Times.
