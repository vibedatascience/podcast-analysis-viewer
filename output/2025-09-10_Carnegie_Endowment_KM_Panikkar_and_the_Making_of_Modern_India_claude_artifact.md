**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. Early Life and Oxford Education (1914-1918)

***"He was incredibly sensitive, incredibly not sporty at all, loved his books, would love nothing more than to spend all his time reading"***

Panikkar was born in Kuttanad, Kerala, into a generationally wealthy and privileged family. His grandmother served as the primary maternal figure, teaching him the Malayalam alphabet and nurturing his intellectual curiosity. The family had pioneered land reclamation from Vembanad Lake for paddy cultivation, establishing their economic prominence. His early education proved inconsistent - he struggled particularly with mathematics and faced such academic pressure that he once attempted suicide by drinking chloroform, an incident that left him with lasting feelings of inadequacy about his intellectual abilities.

His educational trajectory shifted dramatically when his brother, already studying in Edinburgh, arranged for him to come to England in 1914. Arriving at Oxford on the cusp of World War I, Panikkar encountered a world in tremendous flux - **labor unrest, social and economic inequalities, the Irish Home Rule bills, and the fight for universal adult franchise**. The Oxford Majlis debating society became crucial to his intellectual formation, where students from Burma, Ceylon, and India debated nationalism's meaning for their respective countries. Between 1914-1918, he began his prolific writing career that would continue until his death in 1963, producing works on **citizenship, immigration, international relations, and international economics** - remarkably complex subjects for an undergraduate student.

## 2. Development of Nationalist Philosophy and Greater India Concept

***"Nationalism for him was centered around Hinduism. It was the ethos around which the entire country could pull itself together"***

Panikkar's nationalist philosophy emerged from the **Greater India school of thought** - a trans-imperialist, Indocentric movement that served as pushback against colonialism. This ideology asserted that India's commercial, spiritual, and cultural influence had extended across Southeast Asia and Central Asia long before European colonization. For Panikkar, this represented a **cultural empire rather than territorial sovereignty**, distinguishing his views from the muscular Hindu nationalism developing in the 1920s and 1930s.

His conception maintained that **any brand of nationalism India espouses must always account for India's plurality and diversity**, remembering that India was not a homogeneous monolith but heterogeneous, home to several different religions, languages, and communities. This placed him in what scholars identify as the **Hindu traditionalist middle ground** - viewing Hinduism as core to India while not using it as an exclusionary tool against minorities. In the post-colonial era, he adapted his terminology from "Greater India" to "Further India," though the semantic change didn't fully address the problematic nature of promoting a Hindu core in a newly independent, secular nation aspiring to be an emissary of peace during the Cold War.

## 3. Complex Relationships with Gandhi and Nehru

***"You didn't really tell Gandhi no when he came personally to recruit you for the freedom movement"***

Panikkar's relationship with Gandhi combined **deep respect with strategic opportunism**. When Gandhi personally approached him in the early 1920s to join the freedom struggle, Panikkar declined, citing his commitment to teaching at Aligarh Muslim University - a remarkably bold rejection. However, he later served as Gandhi's emissary to Amritsar in 1920 to resolve the Akali dispute between the Akalis and corrupt priests controlling the gurdwaras. Despite having no knowledge of Hindustani, he successfully mediated the complex dispute involving rival princes of Nabha and Patiala, the British government, and the Congress's attempts to establish political roots in the region.

His relationship with Nehru proved **longer and more complex**, spanning from 1923 to 1963. Initially reporting to Nehru from Amritsar, Panikkar later essentially "ghosted" Nehru when asked to compile essays on the non-cooperation movement, ignoring repeated letters inquiring about his intentions. This audacity earned Nehru's reluctant respect. By the 1940s, Panikkar had established himself as a **foreign policy mandarin and historian of note**. Despite significant disagreements - particularly over linguistic reorganization of states and Panikkar's increasingly chauvinist Hindu nationalist views in the 1950s - Nehru continued appointing him to crucial positions including ambassador to China, Egypt, and France, demonstrating respect for intellectual diversity even when personally irritated.

## 4. The Princely States and Federation Vision

***"Federation is the blueprint for modern India where princely states can come on board with the provinces"***

Panikkar's involvement with princely states began through his writings in 1919-1920, initially expressing contempt for rulers he described as governed by "backstage intrigue and their zenanas." His perspective evolved as princes sought greater recognition post-World War I, demanding reassurance about their sovereignty and privileges. In 1925, while in London training as a lawyer, he strategically networked his way to Khan Bahadur Huq, adviser to the Maharaja of Kashmir, presenting a manuscript calling for **federation where states would serve as laboratories for preserving regional identities and self-governance**.

As secretary to the Chamber of Princes, Panikkar navigated extraordinarily complex negotiations involving **565 princely states with conflicting egos and interests**. The stakes included rulers like Patiala and Bikaner who despised each other, the Nawab of Bhopal with separate interests, Hyderabad refusing federation participation, and Travancore with C.P. Ramaswami Iyer playing Machiavellian games. The **First Round Table Conference** marked a historic moment with Indians sitting as equals with British officials to negotiate India's post-colonial future. Despite the Government of India Act 1935 becoming one of modern India's greatest constitutional landmarks, federation ultimately failed due to princes' fears about their privileges and rights, leaving Panikkar profoundly disillusioned when World War II effectively killed the federation project in 1939.

## 5. Controversial China Ambassadorship (1947-1952)

***"Mao was this new age Moses who's going to lead his people to the promised land"***

Nehru appointed Panikkar as ambassador to Nationalist China in 1947, lacking trained foreign service personnel immediately post-independence. His November 1948 memo presciently predicted Communist victory and their subsequent pursuit of **historical territorial consolidation**. However, his reporting from Communist China became problematically romanticized - describing Zhou Enlai's fingers as resembling "tender green onion shoots" and characterizing Mao in messianic terms.

**The gravest error occurred in 1952** when Panikkar failed to mention border issues during negotiations with China despite repeated protests from Ministry of External Affairs colleagues. Sardar Patel had warned Nehru in 1949-50 that Panikkar seemed "more an advocate of the communist leadership than our ambassador." Other nations noticed his privileged access to Communist leaders, while the MEA grew increasingly alarmed at his reporting. The controversy particularly centered on his **misreporting of the Chinese invasion of Tibet and failure to address border concerns**, mistakes that would haunt India-China relations. By 1959, when further India-China troubles emerged, Nehru was forced to defend his former ambassador's actions in Parliament, an uncomfortable position given the strategic failures.

## 6. Visionary Maritime and Regional Strategy

***"India should remember that historically and geographically it has a very strong seaboard that it should utilize"***

In the 1940s, while India remained colonized and World War II raged, Panikkar authored a remarkably prescient tract on independent maritime policy. Observing Japan's transformation into a Pacific juggernaut reaching India's northeast doorstep, he called for India to leverage its extensive coastline strategically. His vision included establishing **"steel wings" across Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Yemen**, essentially military or naval installations securing India's maritime interests.

Most remarkably, he proposed a **regional order in the Indian Ocean** incorporating Great Britain, South Africa, and Australia in important positions - essentially prefiguring modern arrangements like the Quad by decades. His analysis emphasized that **even natural barriers like the Himalayas shouldn't be taken for granted** given how World War II had transformed warfare through air power. He insisted that **air power must supplement naval power** in India's defense strategy, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of evolving military technology and geopolitical realities. This maritime vision reflected his broader pattern of thinking about India's place in the world, always considering historical precedents while anticipating future challenges.

## 7. Evolution and Complexity of Hindu Nationalist Views

***"There's a difference between being chauvinistic and insular and being supremacist"***

Panikkar's Hindu nationalism evolved significantly throughout his career, maintaining certain constants while shifting in problematic directions. At university, he centered nationalism around Hinduism as an ethos capable of uniting the country, but crucially emphasized Hinduism's **"generous vagueness"** that could encompass India's diversity. Unlike the muscular, territorial Hindu nationalism emerging in the 1920s-30s, his vision remained focused on **cultural rather than political supremacy**.

By the 1950s-60s, Panikkar had entered what could be characterized as a **chauvinist Hindu nationalist phase**, considerably annoying Nehru. He doubled down on Hinduism as India's unifying core while the nation presented itself internationally as secular and peaceful. In the late 1950s, he controversially advocated for **Hindi as the national language** - a position he'd never previously held - prompting Nehru to publicly refute him, stating India's multiple languages made imposing any single language wrong. French journalists challenged Nehru about having an ambassador promoting Hindu nationalism, forcing the Prime Minister to uncomfortably explain that India accommodated diverse viewpoints even if incorrect. Despite the insular and potentially marginalizing nature of these later views, they never crossed into sectarian supremacism, maintaining that Indian nationalism must always account for plurality and diversity.

## 8. Lasting Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

***"He never stops thinking about what it means to be an Indian, what it means to be India"***

Panikkar's prescience emerged from his ability to **synthesize global observations with India's specific needs**. In 1920s Paris, encountering dissidents from various colonies, he recognized India's presence throughout Southeast Asia and understood how different regions were developing unique responses to empire, imperialism, and fascism. This led him to argue that **decolonization must incorporate Asia and Africa** - there could be no true end to colonialism without acknowledging these regions.

His vision for **regional maritime cooperation** in the 1940s essentially prefigured modern arrangements like the Quad, demonstrating remarkable foresight about India's strategic needs. Throughout his career spanning 1915-1963, he remained present at virtually every milestone of modern India's formation - from the freedom movement through the first two decades of independence. His work touched **journalism, diplomacy, constitutional law, state reorganization, and foreign policy**, always maintaining focus on India's civilizational identity while grappling with its modern political form. The tension in his thought between cultural nationalism and political pluralism, between civilizational continuity and modern state-building, remains deeply relevant to contemporary Indian debates about national identity, federalism, and India's role in the world.
