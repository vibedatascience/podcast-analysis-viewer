**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Erasure of Alternative Independence Narratives

***"When we think back to India's freedom struggle, we think of Gandhi and ahimsa and Satyagraha. But we didn't fight one battle for independence. We fought many."***

The standard narrative of Indian independence taught in schools centers almost exclusively on the Congress Party, Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel. This creates a fundamentally incomplete picture of the freedom struggle. The violent revolutionary movements, communist organizing, and international diplomatic efforts have been systematically erased from popular memory. Chattopadhyaya and Roy represent entire strands of the independence movement that have been forgotten—not because they were unsuccessful in absolute terms, but because they backed causes that ultimately lost out in the political consolidation that followed independence.

The reasons for this erasure are multiple. Chattopadhyaya's death in Stalin's purges wasn't discovered until 1991 when KGB archives opened, meaning his fate remained unknown for decades. Roy was expelled from the Communist Party for supporting Congress, making him persona non grata among communists, while his atheism and criticism of Gandhi made him unacceptable to Congress. Both men were "magnificent failures" in the words used to describe Chattopadhyaya's father—brilliant, passionate, deeply committed, but ultimately unable to navigate the practical politics required for success.

The CBSE curriculum and standard textbooks flatten history into simple narratives where Gandhi's non-violence is presented as the sole path to independence. This ignores the reality that multiple strategies were being pursued simultaneously—violent revolution, international diplomacy, communist organizing, appeals to Germany and Russia for support. The revolutionaries at India House, including Veer Savarkar in his early years, Madanlal Dhingra, and Madame Cama, were calling for complete independence when Congress moderates were only asking for dominion status. This was genuinely radical for its time.

The book reveals how these alternative movements shaped events even when they didn't succeed directly. Chattopadhyaya's League Against Imperialism served as a blueprint for Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement, though Nehru never acknowledged this debt. Roy's draft constitution influenced Ambedkar's work. The early communist organizing influenced labor laws and trade union movements. These contributions have been obscured because the men themselves were marginalized.

## 2. Virendranath Chattopadhyaya: The Cosmopolitan Revolutionary

***"My beloved father said be not limited ever to Indians but let it be your pride that you are a citizen of the world."***

Chattopadhyaya came from the remarkable Chattopadhyaya family of Hyderabad—his sister was Sarojini Naidu, his brother Harindranath was a renowned poet and artist. Their father Agoranath was principal of Nizam's College, a man of immense learning who educated all his children equally and instilled in them a cosmopolitan worldview. Agoranath was described by Sarojini as "a dreamer, a great man whose life has been a magnificent failure"—words that would prove prophetic for his son.

Chattopadhyaya arrived in London intending to join the Indian Civil Service, following the conventional path for educated Indians. His failure in the civil service exams and inability to establish himself as a barrister might seem like the circumstantial triggers that pushed him toward revolution. However, the deeper truth is that his intellectual formation and family values had already prepared him for this path. The Chattopadhyaya household was filled with intellectuals discussing ideas, science, religion, and politics. Agoranath himself had been forced out of Hyderabad for taking a principled stand on a minor political dispute—demonstrating the same inability to compromise that would characterize his son.

At India House in Highgate, Chattopadhyaya encountered Veer Savarkar (in his early, pre-Hindutva phase), Madanlal Dhingra, Madame Cama, and Shyamji Krishna Varma. These revolutionaries had the freedom to speak and write in Britain in ways impossible in India. They published newspapers, gave speeches, and openly called for Indian independence—complete independence, not the dominion status that Congress moderates sought. This exposure radicalized Chattopadhyaya completely.

He became an extraordinary linguist, speaking approximately ten languages including Bengali, Telugu, Hindi, Urdu, English, French, Russian, Dutch, Italian, and Swedish. This linguistic ability made him genuinely cosmopolitan, able to move between revolutionary circles across Europe. In Paris, he worked with Madame Cama and met Egyptian and other colonized nationalists. In Berlin, he led the Berlin Indians and attempted to forge alliances with Germany during World War I to fight Britain.

Chattopadhyaya's newspaper Talwar became increasingly radical. Initially alarmed when Krishna Varma defended the killing of two British women in a bombing, arguing that those who associate with wrongdoers do so at their peril, Chattopadhyaya eventually moved beyond peaceful resistance himself. British police described him as "full of imagination like many Bengalis" and "continually propounding elaborate schemes for revolution which were not of the slightest practical value." Even Madame Cama said he was "all talk and no work."

Yet Chattopadhyaya achieved significant things. He co-founded the League Against Imperialism with Willi Münzenberg—essentially a League of Nations for colonized peoples, since the actual League of Nations consisted only of colonizing powers. This organization served as the blueprint for Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement, though Nehru never acknowledged the debt. Chattopadhyaya's vision was that colonized nations—India, African countries, Egypt, Middle Eastern countries—deserved representation and voice in international affairs.

His personal life was marked by the same impracticality that characterized his politics. Like his father, he gave away money freely and lived in poverty. He owned only one suit that had never known a crease in years. His relationship with Agnes Smedley was toxic—he was "a revolutionary in the streets but a reactionary in the sheets," unable to live with an independent modern woman despite his progressive rhetoric. He was jealous of her writing career, expected her to cook and clean for visiting revolutionaries, and was upset about her past relationships. Smedley eventually escaped to China where she became a renowned foreign correspondent covering Mao's Long March.

## 3. M.N. Roy: From Bomb-Thrower to Lenin's Protégé

***"If it is patriotic in an Englishman to fight against the Germans if they were to occupy this country, it is much more justifiable and patriotic in my case to fight against the English."***

M.N. Roy began life as Narendra Nath Bhattacharya in a poor Bengali family with spotty education. Unlike the genteel, educated Chattopadhyaya, Roy was a man of action from the start—a bomb-thrower influenced by robust Bengali nationalists like Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Bhagat Jatin, and Jatindranath Mukherjee. He threw bombs at British officials and institutions as part of the revolutionary movement.

Bhagat Jatin sent Roy to the Far East to gather money and arms for India's independence struggle. Roy traveled to Japan, Java, and China attempting to forge alliances, but failed repeatedly. One fundamental problem was that most nations simply didn't believe India could become independent—it was the jewel in the crown, and Britain would never give it up. The racism of the era meant that even potential allies didn't take Indian independence seriously.

Fleeing police pursuit, Roy ended up in the United States where he met Lala Lajpat Rai and members of the Ghadar movement. This encounter proved intellectually transformative. Roy asked Lala Lajpat Rai a crucial question: what happens after independence? Won't we just be turning India over to big zamindars, big business, and the wealthy? What happens to the common man? Lala Lajpat Rai had no convincing answer—he said independence must come first. But Roy felt that if India was liberated only to be turned over to Gandhi and his ilk, it wasn't worth the struggle. India wouldn't be truly independent.

This questioning led Roy toward communism. He moved to Mexico where, remarkably, he founded the Mexican Communist Party—an Indian who didn't speak Spanish creating what someone described as "six men and a calico cat." Nevertheless, it was the only communist party outside the Soviet Union at the time, which brought Roy to Lenin's attention.

Roy became Lenin's protégé in the Soviet Union, meeting Trotsky and Stalin, given important tasks by the Comintern. He was sent on various missions, including to China with a wagon full of gold and machine guns to foment revolution. These missions consistently failed—possibly because he was set up to fail, possibly due to unfavorable circumstances, possibly due to Roy's natural arrogance. His memoir reveals a man quite full of himself.

Roy's charisma was legendary. He was described as having film star good looks, and when he walked into a room, everyone else stopped talking. This charisma, combined with mentorship by Mikhail Borodin (Lenin's close friend), meant Roy reached Lenin first and secured his favor before Chattopadhyaya arrived in Moscow. The rivalry between Roy and Chattopadhyaya for Lenin's patronage was intense, fought over a tiny piece of the pie.

Roy's ideological journey was more pragmatic than Chattopadhyaya's. He realized the Communist Party in India was tiny and couldn't possibly win independence. So he decided everyone must support Congress under Gandhi, despite privately considering Nehru "a thoughtless, vain, egocentric, popularity-hunting demagogue who is popular amongst Congressmen with a modern outlook because his demagogy rationalizes Gandhi's irrationalism and supplies a pseudo-socialist veneer to reactionary nationalism." For this pragmatic shift, Roy was expelled from the Communist Party.

Returning to India, Roy was arrested and imprisoned for six years. After release, he joined Congress but couldn't get along with Gandhi and Nehru. Gandhi was a nationalist, religious, and in many ways reactionary. Roy was a hedonist, atheist, and complete cosmopolitan. They were opposites who couldn't compromise. Roy called Gandhi "unclear socially and knows nothing of economics. He was trained in British constitutional law and that is always a poison that works in the system of Indian leaders causing them to betray our people time and again for the sake of British phrases."

Eventually Roy left Congress and founded the Radical Humanist movement based on "Royism"—a philosophy centered on individual freedom over collectivism, rejecting Soviet collectivism entirely. His 22 theses were based on the fundamental principle that the individual was above society and freedom can only be enjoyed by individuals. This was attractive but impractical in India. Roy's Guardian obituary captured it perfectly: he had "the most extraordinary career of a man of his generation in Asia. It was of interest out of proportion to his actual achievements."

## 4. The Women Behind the Revolutionaries

***"He is fine in theory, a modern man, but in practice he is a walking lie. He still judges women by her vagina. In fact, a woman is nothing but a walking vagina to him and he is the sole owner of it."***

Agnes Smedley's devastating assessment of Chattopadhyaya reveals the profound hypocrisy of revolutionary men who spoke of liberation while oppressing the women in their lives. Both Chattopadhyaya and Roy exemplified this contradiction—progressive in public rhetoric, reactionary in private relationships.

Agnes Smedley was an American journalist and activist of extraordinary capability. She had met Roy in New York before meeting Chattopadhyaya in Berlin. Her relationship with Chattopadhyaya was deeply toxic. Despite his progressive politics, he couldn't live with an independent modern woman. He was jealous of her past relationships, jealous of her writing career, and expected her to serve as a domestic drudge—cooking and cleaning for the constant stream of revolutionary visitors to their home. When she began developing as a writer, he told her he didn't want her to write.

The Berlin Indians used Smedley's labor without respect. She was seen as Chattopadhyaya's "keep" since they weren't married, never receiving the respect she deserved. Roy particularly despised her, calling her "an evil witch" and "a temptress." In Smedley's fictionalized autobiography "Daughter of Earth," the heroine is raped by an Indian nationalist whose identity she doesn't reveal. One biographer claims this could be Roy, though evidence is inconclusive. What is certain is the mutual hatred between Roy and Smedley.

Smedley eventually escaped to China where she flourished as a foreign correspondent, covering Mao's Long March and becoming close to Mao and the Chinese communists. She achieved the career Chattopadhyaya had tried to prevent. Her story demonstrates how these revolutionary men, for all their talk of liberation, couldn't extend that liberation to the women in their lives.

Evelyn Trent, Roy's first wife, was treated better than Smedley only because she completely subordinated herself to Roy. She was the typical Indian wife despite being American—looking after him, helping him write articles, traveling uncomplainingly from country to country, completely dimming her own light so he could shine. She stepped back entirely from her own ambitions and potential. Roy eventually dumped her for another woman, Ellen Gottschalk, who also completely subordinated herself to him.

Kamala Chattopadhyaya, Virendranath's sister-in-law, wrote perceptively about "champagne socialism" in 1928: "Indians abroad fail to see that these communist friends are usually those who have either no opportunity of becoming capitalists and thus convert a disadvantage into a virtue, or bourgeoisie who play the superficial role of the communists as a sort of recreation or amusement." This critique applies to the gender politics of these revolutionaries—they advocated equality in theory while practicing oppression in their homes.

The pattern was consistent: modern men said they wanted educated wives, but when their wives actually got education and developed independence, the men couldn't handle it. This was true in the 19th century with figures like Anandibai Joshi's husband, and it remained true with 20th century revolutionaries. The men wanted to be saviors and main characters. They couldn't genuinely share space with women as equals.

Interestingly, Chattopadhyaya's final wife, Lydia Karunasia, a Russian woman, spoke of him fondly. Perhaps by the end of his life he had learned to do better. But for most of his life, like Roy, he exemplified the disconnect between revolutionary rhetoric and personal practice.

## 5. India House and the Radical Independence Movement

***"It is perfectly justifiable on our part to kill the Englishman who is polluting our sacred land."***

India House in Highgate, North London (not to be confused with the Indian embassy in Holborn) was a hostel founded by Shyamji Krishna Varma that became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. Krishna Varma believed in complete independence for India when Congress moderates were only pleading for dominion status. This was genuinely radical for the time.

The house attracted revolutionaries including Veer Savarkar (in his early phase, before his later Hindutva ideology developed), Madanlal Dhingra, Madame Cama, and eventually Chattopadhyaya. Savarkar gave fiery speeches calling for Indians to die for dharma and throw out the English. He influenced Madanlal Dhingra, who killed a British official. Behind the scenes, everyone knew Savarkar was influential in this assassination.

Savarkar's dramatic escape attempt—jumping from a porthole while being transported by ship, landing on the French coast but being recaptured because he didn't speak French—was described vividly by Harindranath Chattopadhyaya. If Savarkar had died in 1910, he would be remembered today like Bhagat Singh or Madanlal Dhingra—as a revolutionary martyr. His Hindutva ideology came much later, after years of torture in prison.

The India House revolutionaries had access to British freedom of speech in ways impossible in India. They published newspapers, gave speeches, and wrote openly about independence. Many of their letters were published in The Times. This exposure to British civil liberties while being denied those same liberties in India radicalized many young Indians. They saw how British people had full freedom of speech and decided Indians deserved the same.

Krishna Varma defended even controversial violence. When two innocent British women were killed in a bombing, he wrote in The Times: "Supposing for argument's sake that they were killed deliberately, it would only prove that those who habitually live and associate with wrongdoers or robbers"—meaning Englishmen—"do so at their peril." This was an extreme position that initially alarmed even Chattopadhyaya, who believed in peaceful resistance. But once he fled to Paris and escaped British reach, he became increasingly radical.

The India House movement represented a strand of the independence struggle that advocated violence, complete independence, and international alliances against Britain. This was far more radical than even the so-called extremists in Congress like Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The moderates were "extreme in their moderation" and the extremists were "moderate in their extremism"—they weren't that far apart. But the India House revolutionaries were genuinely far from Congress positions.

This movement has been largely erased from popular memory because it didn't succeed and because its methods were controversial. But it represented a significant current of thought and action in the independence struggle. The revolutionaries published newspapers like Bande Mataram (started by Madame Cama in Paris) and Talwar (started by Chattopadhyaya), spreading propaganda and building networks across Europe.

## 6. The Berlin Indians and International Alliances

***"I hold the English people responsible for the murder of 80 million of Indian people in the last 50 years and they are also responsible for taking away 100 million pounds every year from India to this country."***

During World War I, Chattopadhyaya led the Berlin Indians, a group of revolutionaries attempting to forge alliances with Germany against Britain. The logic was straightforward: Britain's enemy could be India's friend. The Germans were willing to provide some support—small sums of money, help with organization—but they fundamentally didn't believe India could become independent.

The racism of the era meant that even potential allies didn't take Indian independence seriously. The Germans would go so far and no further. They saw Indians as useful tools against Britain but not as equals deserving genuine support for independence. This pattern repeated with every potential ally the revolutionaries approached.

Baron Max von Oppenheim, an archaeologist who excavated sites in Iraq (including Tell Halaf, which Agatha Christie and her husband visited), worked with the Germans on what was called a "jihad" strategy—mobilizing Muslim peoples against the British. Chattopadhyaya was involved in these schemes, which ultimately came to nothing due to disorganization, dissension among revolutionaries, and lack of genuine German commitment.

There was even a dramatic incident where Chattopadhyaya was promised money by Germans and rushed to Switzerland to meet them. It was actually a trap set by the British Secret Service. They had a contract to assassinate Chattopadhyaya and were waiting with "a dagger, a revolver, and a bottle of chloroform" in their car. He escaped only because Swiss police intercepted the car. This demonstrated both Chattopadhyaya's naivety—assuming everyone who claimed to support independence actually did—and the serious threat he posed to British interests.

The Berlin Indians met various socialists—Swedish, Dutch, and others—who were keen on socialism for India but balked at independence. They would say "let's have socialism first, then maybe independence if you show yourself qualified." This paternalistic racism was pervasive even among supposed progressives.

Chattopadhyaya also encountered Italian nationalists inspired by Garibaldi and Mazzini, Egyptian nationalists, and other colonized peoples fighting for independence. These international connections shaped his cosmopolitan worldview. He genuinely saw himself as a citizen of the world, not limited to Indian identity.

The provisional government set up in Afghanistan in 1915, headed by Raja Mahendra Pratap of Hatras, was another wild scheme that came to nothing. Lenin eventually rejected it, not wanting this "fake prince" involved. These international revolutionary efforts were characterized by grand ambitions, limited resources, constant surveillance by British intelligence, and ultimate failure.

## 7. The Moscow Years and Communist Organizing

***"The individual had been crushed by Stalin's move towards collectivism. So he began to see individual freedom as all important."***

Both Chattopadhyaya and Roy ended up in Moscow, though their experiences diverged dramatically. Roy arrived first, mentored by Mikhail Borodin, and became Lenin's protégé. He met Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin, rising to the top ranks of international communism. He was sent on various Comintern missions, including to China with a wagon full of gold and machine guns to foment revolution.

Roy founded the Mexican Communist Party and later the Indian Communist Party. He had enormous influence on early Indian communists and trade union leaders including S.A. Dange, Maniben Kara, and Vibbi Karnik. These people helped formulate early labor laws after independence and organized mill workers, peasants, and railway workers. Roy's influence on the labor movement was significant, though largely forgotten today.

When Chattopadhyaya finally reached Moscow, Roy had already secured Lenin's favor. The rivalry between them was intense. Agnes Smedley's presence complicated matters—she had known Roy in New York, and Roy despised her. When Chattopadhyaya and Smedley arrived in Moscow, they were largely ignored. Lenin told Chattopadhyaya to send his thesis, read it, and that was essentially that. The relationship never developed.

Chattopadhyaya eventually gave up revolutionary activity in Moscow and became an academic. He married a Russian woman, Lydia Karunasia, and for the first time in his life had peace and quiet. He became a successful academic and writer. Then Stalin's Great Purge began.

Stalin arrested people for the flimsiest reasons—being a foreigner, writing a letter, dancing, singing, anything. When Chattopadhyaya's friends started being arrested, he knew he was next. He was executed in 1937, but his true fate wasn't known until 1991 when KGB archives opened. Stalin's Great Purge itself was only exposed by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, three years after Stalin's death.

The irony is profound: a communist executed by Stalin. But that was precisely what Stalin's Great Purge was about—eliminating anyone who might pose a threat, including loyal communists. Chattopadhyaya died a communist, having stuck to his philosophy despite everything.

Roy's experience was different. He became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet communism as he witnessed Stalin's excesses. He began formulating a new philosophy centered on individual freedom over collectivism. His 22 theses were based on the fundamental principle that the individual was above society and freedom can only be enjoyed by individuals. He completely rejected Soviet collectivism.

Roy explained that man is essentially rational and man is the maker of this world. His philosophy went beyond narrow confines of nationalism, religion, and community—or at least hoped to. This was a radical departure from his earlier communist orthodoxy.

## 8. The Rivalry with Gandhi and Nehru

***"A thoughtless, vain, egocentric, popularity-hunting demagogue who is popular amongst Congressmen with a modern outlook because his demagogy rationalizes Gandhi's irrationalism and supplies a pseudo-socialist veneer to reactionary nationalism."***

Both Chattopadhyaya and Roy had fraught relationships with Gandhi and Nehru, the mainstream Congress leadership. Their criticisms contained genuine insights but also revealed their own impracticality and inability to navigate real politics.

Chattopadhyaya was initially friends with Nehru but their relationship deteriorated completely. Between 1927 and 1930, they exchanged letters where Chattopadhyaya essentially lectured Nehru to dump Gandhi, become president of Congress, and move toward proper socialism instead of "sham socialism." Chattopadhyaya believed Congress was basically a party of banyas (merchants), big businessmen, and zamindars. He wanted it to align with common peasants.

Nehru took umbrage at being lectured about what was happening in India by someone sitting abroad. He pointed out that he and Congress were dealing with the government daily, understanding ground realities, while Chattopadhyaya was out of touch. This was a valid criticism. Chattopadhyaya was so anti-Gandhi, anti-Nehru, and anti-compromise that he completely lost touch with the delicate negotiations happening for independence—one step forward, two steps back.

Chattopadhyaya's criticism of Gandhi was harsh: "He is unclear socially and knows nothing of economics. He was trained in British constitutional law and that is always a poison that works in the system of Indian leaders causing them to betray our people time and again for the sake of British phrases." There's truth here—Gandhi's economic ideas were indeed unclear and often impractical. But Chattopadhyaya missed that Gandhi had the charisma to unite all of India—north, south, east, west—in ways no one else could.

Roy was more pragmatic. He was a diehard communist until about 1930, when he realized communism was tiny in India and couldn't possibly fight for independence. He decided everyone must support Congress and Nehru. Privately, he had the poor opinion of Nehru quoted above, but publicly he supported Congress as the only party that could win independence.

Roy returned to India and was imprisoned for six years. After release, he joined Congress but couldn't get along with Gandhi. There was a telling incident: Gandhi asked Roy to join him in prayer at the prayer ground. Every single Indian would have just gone along, but Roy, being a complete atheist and rebel, refused. Their relationship never recovered. Gandhi essentially told Roy to observe the independence movement from afar—there was no need to worry his pretty little head about it.

Roy and Gandhi were complete opposites. Gandhi was a nationalist, religious, and in many ways reactionary. Roy was a hedonist, atheist, and complete cosmopolitan. They couldn't compromise. Roy eventually left Congress and founded the Radical Humanist movement.

The tragedy is that both Chattopadhyaya and Roy had valid critiques. Congress's socialism was indeed a sham in many ways. Big business did take over after independence. The inequalities they warned about have come to pass—latest figures show 1% of Indians surfing on the other 99%. Their more impractical ideas might not have worked, but their warnings were prescient.

Roy's draft constitution influenced Ambedkar's work. Chattopadhyaya's League Against Imperialism served as blueprint for Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement, though Nehru never acknowledged it. They had influence beyond their marginalization. But they lacked skill in party politics—described as "the most damning indictment in India because the thing you need most of all is skill in party maneuver."

## 9. The Question of Circumstance vs. Character

***"If Chattopadhyaya and Roy had been given arms and money, do you think the independence movement would have taken a different turn? I do not think so."***

A fundamental question about both men is whether their revolutionary paths were circumstantial or essential to their characters. Chattopadhyaya failed the civil service exams and couldn't establish himself as a barrister. Were these failures what drove him to revolution? Would he have been a loyal civil servant in different circumstances?

The evidence suggests character was more important than circumstance. Chattopadhyaya came from a family where his father Agoranath had demonstrated the same inability to compromise—getting kicked out of Hyderabad for taking a principled stand on a minor political dispute. The family valued culture, learning, and struggle over wealth and comfort. Agoranath told his children: "I am leaving you a wonderful thing—a life of culture and a life of struggle. Thank god I have been able to leave you with a brain and intellect, knowledge, and I hope a really honest and upright heart."

This generosity and impracticality characterized both father and son. Chattopadhyaya, like his father, gave away money freely and lived in poverty. He owned one suit that had never known a crease in years. This wasn't circumstantial—it was core to who he was.

Similarly, Roy's path seems inevitable given his character. He was influenced by robust Bengali nationalists from the start. His questioning of Lala Lajpat Rai—what happens to the common man after independence?—revealed a mind that couldn't accept simple answers. His constant ideological evolution, from bomb-thrower to communist to radical humanist, showed someone genuinely grappling with ideas rather than opportunistically changing positions.

Both men were described as having "a talent for always pursuing doomed causes" and "always backing the wrong horse." This wasn't bad luck—it was character. They couldn't compromise enough to succeed in practical politics. They were too principled, too intellectual, too cosmopolitan for the nationalist movement that ultimately won.

The question of whether they could have changed the independence movement with more resources is telling. The answer is probably no. India would only have gotten independence through Congress under Gandhi. The Communist Party was tiny. Violent revolution wasn't viable. The delicate negotiations Nehru described were necessary.

But their failures don't negate their importance. They represented alternative visions of what India could be. They warned about problems that came to pass. They influenced people and movements in ways not always acknowledged. Their lives demonstrate that history isn't just about winners—the losers and their ideas matter too.

## 10. The Challenge of Writing Popular History

***"I'm trying to find that sweet spot between scholarly history and WhatsApp history."***

The book represents a conscious effort to write popular history that's accessible to general readers while maintaining scholarly rigor. This is challenging because Indian non-fiction tends toward either dense academic work or superficial popular accounts.

Every chapter begins with an interesting anecdote rather than boring chronology. The 1910 raid on Agoranath Chattopadhyaya's house, with family members hiding Virendranath's letter, opens one chapter dramatically. The book is structured as alternating chapters between Chattopadhyaya and Roy, creating a road movie feel with parallel journeys across the 20th century.

The goal was to make it a page-turner competing with Netflix, podcasts, and YouTube videos. This required leaving out material that might interest scholars but would bore general readers. The book isn't an exhaustive biography—much more could be written. But the priority was making it readable by anybody without taking months.

This approach is controversial. Historians expect peer-reviewed scholarly work. But there's a need for the middle ground—books that are well-researched enough to be reliable but written engagingly enough to reach wide audiences. William Dalrymple's recent comments about India needing more popular history were controversial but fundamentally correct.

The structure of alternating chapters between the two protagonists was deliberate. They're presented as rivals who never met in agreement but knew the same people, moved in the same circles, and led parallel lives. Some readers loved this structure; others found it challenging. Keeping timelines consistent across alternating narratives was difficult, as was managing the many characters—major figures, minor communist figures nobody's heard of.

The book required extensive archival research in the British Library, where most material on these figures is held (also available in National Archives in Delhi). The research was painstaking—going through pages and pages until completely sick of it. For 15 months, this was daily work, sitting in libraries from 9:30 AM onward.

The British Library was hacked in a ransomware attack in October 2023, taking down their entire digital system. For six months, it was like working in a 1920s library—writing requests on paper, waiting hours for books to be retrieved. This made an already tight deadline even more challenging.

## 11. Gender Dynamics in Historical Writing

***"Ninety percent of non-fiction is written by men. I have wondered why so many women are being slowly pushed into children's writing."***

A striking pattern in non-fiction publishing is that men write the vast majority of historical and political non-fiction, while women are disproportionately represented in children's literature. This isn't because children's literature is lesser—it's brilliant and necessary—but the pattern reveals structural barriers.

Non-fiction is expensive and difficult to write because it requires access to research libraries. Most of India lacks good research libraries beyond Nehru Memorial in Delhi and Asiatic Society in Mumbai. Women need to take time off to go to libraries, but who looks after children? One famous historical writer spends four months annually in Nehru Memorial researching. He can do this because he has a wife looking after his children. Women with children can't leave for four months.

Grants exist, like American grants for three-month research stays, but which Indian woman can leave her kids for three months? And women whose kids have grown up often seamlessly move to taking care of in-laws. The expectation is that they can't possibly survive with just a man in the house—their own son.

Non-fiction is also expensive because of travel and hotel costs for research. It seems easier for women to write fiction or children's books that don't require extensive archival research. This isn't actually easier, but it's more accessible given women's constraints.

Women are also diffident about calling themselves experts. Many women in corporate India are experts in their fields but don't write books about their expertise, even with ghostwriters. Why? Because women are socialized to doubt themselves. The question "do you have imposter syndrome?" is constantly asked of women writers but rarely of men.

The response to this should be clear: women should not have imposter syndrome. Yes, there are moments of wondering whether something was done right. But women shouldn't spend time thinking they don't deserve to write, that they should stick to something smaller or easier. More women need to write non-fiction, bringing perspectives men might lack—attention to marginal characters like Agnes Smedley, Evelyn Trent, and Ellen Gottschalk who might otherwise be ignored.

The pattern in receiving criticism is also gendered. When criticized, men's instinctive response is often "no, I was great, there's something wrong with you." Women's instinctive response is beating themselves up: "oh my god, I'm not good enough, I can't do this." This requires conscious correction—women need to wake up every morning and tell themselves "I am awesome."

The unwarranted self-confidence of men versus the unwarranted self-doubt of women is a pervasive pattern. Women need to be more willing to ask for what they want. The author got herself onto this podcast by simply emailing and asking. If you want something, just ask. Sometimes people say no, sometimes yes, but you lose nothing by asking.

## 12. The Solitary Nature of Historical Research

***"Writing a book is just a job like any other. The only way to write a book is to write it."***

Writing historical non-fiction is profoundly solitary work. For 15 months, the daily routine was: wake at 5 AM, do initial reading, do housework, leave by 9:30 AM, spend all day in the British Library ferreting out material and condensing it. This was the opposite of Lady Doctors, which lacked material because women's letters and memoirs weren't preserved. This book had almost too much material—Roy wrote over 30 books, pamphlets, and countless letters, all painstakingly archived by his wife Ellen.

The challenge was condensing this into readable form. Readers won't read pages of communist philosophy. The daily task was going through material until completely sick of it, never wanting to hear about these men again. Then finding the interesting anecdotes and letters that bring the story alive.

Living in a 1,000 square foot London flat with three adults all working from home made the home unconducive to work. Libraries became essential—not just for research but as quiet places to sit and work. The British Library hack made this harder, but libraries remained crucial throughout.

The isolation of this work is difficult for someone who's naturally extroverted and likes meeting people. Unlike many writers who are solitary creatures and enjoy isolation, this author finds it challenging. Coping strategies include: walking extensively (most days over 10 kilometers), joining a choir (no audition required, singing popular soul songs), volunteering as a tour guide at the Painted Hall (a 17th century heritage site), joining the London Agatha Christie Club (complete nerds discussing every Christie book in detail), and participating in book clubs.

These activities provide human connection and also inform the writing. Tour guiding taught crucial lessons: people don't care about dates or too many names. They care about interesting anecdotes that make people human. Audiences get bored if you just rattle off names. The best guides bring in funny anecdotes, jokes, involve the audience, ask questions. This directly influenced the book's approach—make it interesting above all else. If readers aren't reading, it doesn't matter what you're saying.

The discipline required is unglamorous. There's a lot of "woo-woo" stuff written about writing and the muse. But the only way to write a book is to write it. This is much easier with non-fiction than fiction. If given facts, they can be assembled in readable ways. The key is discipline—not glamorous, but essential.

Meeting deadlines matters enormously. If you tell your publisher you'll deliver by a certain date, do it. Otherwise they lose faith. The value of not being a diva in publishing cannot be overstressed. Turn in books on time. Be nice to everybody. Go through painful edits where they say things you don't want to change, but actually you have to change because they know your book better than you do. Just do the work.

## 13. The Cosmopolitan Vision and Its Limits

***"Nehru believed that India's backwardness was due to foreign subjugation. Roy believed that it was India's backwardness that had led to subjugation."***

Both Chattopadhyaya and Roy were genuine cosmopolitans in an era of rising nationalism. They moved fluidly between countries, spoke multiple languages, and saw themselves as citizens of the world rather than being limited to Indian identity. This cosmopolitanism was both their strength and their weakness.

Their international outlook gave them perspectives unavailable to those who stayed in India. They understood global political currents, met world leaders, and could analyze India's situation in comparative context. Roy's insight that India's backwardness led to subjugation rather than vice versa was profound. Nehru believed the industrial revolution explained the difference between poor India and rich Europe. Roy emphasized the Renaissance and Enlightenment, seeking a similar renaissance in India.

This cosmopolitan vision informed Chattopadhyaya's League Against Imperialism—the idea that colonized nations deserved representation in international affairs. It informed Roy's evolution from nationalism to communism to radical humanism, always seeking universal principles beyond narrow identities.

But cosmopolitanism also made them impractical. They were out of touch with ground realities in India. Nehru's criticism was valid: they were sitting abroad lecturing people who dealt with the government daily. The Communist Party was tiny in India. Violent revolution wasn't viable. The delicate negotiations required for independence needed people who understood Indian society deeply, not cosmopolitans who'd spent decades abroad.

Their cosmopolitanism also made them unable to build mass movements. Gandhi, for all his faults, understood Indian society and could speak to peasants, workers, and elites. He united the country in ways cosmopolitans couldn't. Roy's Radical Humanism was attractive to intellectuals but couldn't mobilize masses.

The tension between cosmopolitanism and nationalism remains relevant. In today's globalized world, cosmopolitan perspectives are valuable. But effective political action often requires deep local knowledge and ability to mobilize specific communities. The balance between these remains elusive.

## 14. The Legacy of Forgotten Revolutionaries

***"They had little skill in party maneuver, which is the most damning indictment in India because the thing you need most of all is skill in party maneuver."***

The ultimate question is what these forgotten revolutionaries contributed and why they matter. Their direct political achievements were limited—they didn't win independence, didn't build lasting movements, didn't achieve their stated goals. Yet their legacy is more significant than it appears.

Chattopadhyaya's League Against Imperialism served as blueprint for Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement, giving voice to colonized and developing nations in international affairs. This vision of global solidarity among oppressed peoples remains relevant. His warnings about Congress being a party of big business proved prescient—inequalities have grown dramatically since independence.

Roy's influence on early communists and trade union leaders shaped labor organizing and labor laws after independence. His draft constitution influenced Ambedkar. His intellectual journey from violent revolution to communism to radical humanism demonstrated serious engagement with ideas. His final philosophy emphasizing individual freedom over collectivism anticipated critiques of authoritarian communism.

Both men represented alternative visions of what India could be. They asked uncomfortable questions: What happens to the common man after independence? Will we just turn the country over to big business and zamindars? Is nationalism enough, or do we need deeper social transformation? These questions remain urgent.

Their failures are instructive. They show the limits of ideological purity, the necessity of compromise in politics, the importance of understanding ground realities. They demonstrate that being right isn't enough—you need political skill to implement ideas. Their inability to navigate party politics meant their insights were marginalized.

But their failures also reveal the narrowness of what succeeded. The Congress narrative that dominates textbooks is incomplete. The independence struggle was messy, with multiple competing visions. Violent revolutionaries, communists, and cosmopolitans all played roles. Erasing them impoverishes our understanding of history.

The book's title—Spies, Lies and Allies—captures their lives: pursued by intelligence services across continents, navigating deception and intrigue, seeking international alliances. Their extraordinary lives deserve to be remembered not despite their failures but because of what their failures reveal about the complexity of history and the difficulty of transforming societies.

## 15. The Future of Historical Writing in India

***"There is so much to write about in India—so many interesting people and events. It's just that we don't have the support and the funding and the material."***

The current moment represents a potential golden age for Indian non-fiction. Publishers like Westland's Context imprint are publishing biographies of musicians, social workers, and others who aren't celebrities. Books like "The Patient Assassin" by Anita Anand and "Rama Beimma Soma" by Shriar show what's possible—engaging popular history that reaches wide audiences.

But significant barriers remain. Access to archives is limited—most material is in the British Library or foreign libraries. It's phenomenally expensive for Indians to travel to the UK for research. Indian libraries are inadequate outside Delhi and Mumbai. Funding and grants are insufficient, though initiatives like the New India Foundation grant are helpful.

The challenge of making British audiences care about Indian history is formidable. British Indians often don't know Indian history—one woman named Sarojini after Sarojini Naidu didn't know who Sarojini Naidu was. The flow of knowledge is one-way: Indians read extensively about Western history, know American geography, but Westerners know nothing about India beyond Gandhi and Nehru (and don't realize Mahatma Gandhi isn't related to Indira Gandhi).

This wall is frustrating because Indians shouldn't have to explain what Maharashtra or Karnataka is—people can Google it. But the expectation is that Indian writers must provide extensive context. The goal is to write books British people want to read, getting reviews in British papers, breaking through this wall. This requires finding characters who lived in the UK or have clear connections to British history.

The rise of online platforms changes the landscape. Book tours in Indian cities are difficult because of traffic—people want to come but can't navigate Bangalore traffic on a weekday. Everything is shifting online. A couple of online interviews reached 5,000 people, more than in-person events. Writers must master different mediums—YouTube, podcasts, social media—not out of snobbery but necessity.

Marketing remains essential despite being a dirty word for writers. Nobody says "if the iPad is good, why does it need marketing?" Everything needs marketing. Writers must learn to share their faces, post photos with books, engage on social media despite finding it cringe. People want to know the person behind the book.

The future requires writers to be less snobbish about mediums. A son who doesn't read books knows extensive information from YouTube videos. People acquire knowledge through various means. The goal is reaching readers however they consume content—books, podcasts, videos, online articles.

The hope is that more women will write non-fiction, bringing perspectives men lack. More grants and support are needed. More access to libraries and archives is essential. But the potential is there—India has countless interesting people and events deserving popular histories. The golden age of Indian non-fiction is possible if structural barriers can be overcome.
