----------------------------------------
Today on the rest is history, one of the most thrilling episodes we have ever done. It's the story of Jason and the Argonauts and the quest for the golden fleece. In thrilling detail, we reenact and explore the voyage that Jason made across the Black Sea to Culkus to get the golden fleece and meet the witch media. But there's much more to this episode. There is Alexander the Great, his conquests and what they meant for the Greek world. And if that is not enough, we delve into one of the most exciting stories in all world history.

The girl is pretty and I was always sentimental. But for Jason, there are other adventures. I have not finished with Jason. Let us continue the game another day. So that, as everybody will know, was Zeus, the king of the gods. He is staring down from Mount Olympus at the Greek hero Jason. And Jason's had an extraordinary time. He's sailed all the way from Greece to the distant land of Culkus at the other side of the Black Sea, possibly in present day Georgia. And he's gone there in his ship, the Argo, with the Argonauts. He has captured the fleece of a golden ram from Aites, the king of Culkus. He has won the heart of Aites's daughter, who is called Media, who is a bit of a witch, literally, but very beautiful. and she has helped Jason to win the uh the golden fleece and it's media of whom Zeus says the girl is pretty poor from Zeus and these are the very last lines of the film Jason the Argonauts which came out in 1963 and it starred Todd Armstrong as Jason very wooden and galore herself Honor Blackman as her the uh the queen of the gods now Tommy you think this is a brilliant film don't you. I love it. >> I think it's a bit rubbish, but you think it's brilliant. >> So, before we come on to the question of whether it's um good or bad, there is a friend of the show who thinks it's not just good, but the best film ever made. >> Wow. >> Um just to talk about her on a blackman >> and she plays a key role in the film cuz she actually has a bit of a crush on Jason and so she's always looking out for him throughout her adventures. And in the film, she's a kind of figurehead on the Argo with great long lashes which she flutters adjacent. >> Oh, lovely. Yeah. >> Every so often. So, incredible special effects. And when Zu says, "Let us continue the game another day." He he says that looking at her because they've basically been playing chess with the lives of the Argonauts, moving it around the chessboard on uh on Mount Olympus. It's obvious from that that the script writers were hoping that they would get a sequel, but the problem is that um movie goers agreed with you and thought it was rubbish. Yeah. So that the film completely bombed and so they never got the chance to do Jason the Argonauts part two. >> But Dominic, it is now widely recognized as a classic. >> I think I think that's very strong, Tom. Widely recognized as a classic. And the person who thinks it's brilliant is friend of the show Tom Hanks >> who in 1992 compared it to Casablanca and Citizen Kain and then said it's better than them. It is the greatest film ever made. >> It hasn't struck you that Tom Hanks might have been being ironic. >> I don't think so >> there. No, I I don't think so because he was doing it just before the Oscars part of an special uh a lifetime achievement award that was being given to um Ray Harry Howen. >> Oh yeah. >> Who was the most, you know, the most famous special effects guru in the whole of Hollywood history. So if you ever seen a film where monsters move in a slightly stacato matter, >> the the likelihood is that Ray Harryhen was behind that. and his work on Jason and the Argonauts is widely seen now as the absolute uh acme of um precGI special effects and it's amazing for a film that was made in 1963. So special effects highlights in Jason the Argonauts for those who haven't seen it include Taos who's a giant bronze warrior who comes to life and picks up the Argo and drops it into the sea. Um, there are harpies who are two winged monsters who keep sweeping down and stealing food from a poor guy called Phineas who has offended the gods. Um, he's a blind seer. A lot of blind seers in Greek myth. >> He's Patrick Troutton. He's the second doctor from Doctor Who. Very underrated doctor actually. >> He is. >> Yeah. >> Yes. So I I thought you'd enjoy I mean it's got Hana Blackman. It's got um Patrick Troutton. It's got amazing things. >> It's ticking all my boxes. Yeah. It's just a bad film. Yeah. >> I tell you who else it's got. Nigel Green, who was the sergeant in Zulu. >> Oh, yes. >> Um, who plays Heracles. >> Yes. >> And most amusingly of all, Argus, who's the guy who builds the Argo, >> uh, and is the captain. >> He's played by the guy who in A Night to Remember, the great film about Titanic, played Captain Smith. Well, he's >> and to be honest, you know, if you've got to sail a ship from Greece to to Kulkus, Captain Smith is the last person you want more slaughter of Captain Smith. Captain Smith completed many, many, many voyages before that unfortunate incident. He was a very reliable captain and I just want to make it absolutely clear once again, I would happily sail with Captain Smith at any date you care to mention, except probably that night in 1912. Would you trust Captain Smith to get the Argo through the clashing rocks? >> Well, he clearly did. He did. So, obviously I would. >> Yeah. Right. Clashing rocks also appear in Jason the Argonauts. Um, and the most famous special effects in Jason and the Argonauts is skeletons that rise up out of the earth after King who's furious cuz Jason's stolen the golden fleece. He sews the teeth of a monster that Jason has slain. Um, and these skeletons fight with Jason and two of his friends. Kills two of the friends and Jason jumps into the sea. Um, I mean, if you haven't seen it, it's on YouTube. It's it's it's absolutely brilliant. That idea of sewing the dragon's teeth may sound familiar because um people may remember that Cadmas, the prince of Ty, who went searching for Europa, who um dressed up as a Mayad um in the back eye, you know, the founder of thieves. He had also sewn a monster's teeth from which armed warriors had sprouted. And it's true that they weren't skeletons and that Cadmas rather than fight them had picked up a rock and thrown it into the middle of them and they they'd all kind of killed each other. But it's clearly the same basic idea. And so people may be wondering, well, what's this story that was a cadmas in Thieves? What's it doing in Jason and the Argonauts? Isn't this just a classic example of Hollywood taking bits and pieces from different myths and stitching it all together and making a complete kind of Frankenstein's monster out of the whole thing? M >> but Dominic. >> Yeah, there's always a butt. >> There is a butt. Jason and the Argonauts, the film is actually a very very faithful adaptation of an epic called the Argonautica which was written sometime around 250 BC by a Greek poet called Appalonius of Roads. >> And this is the the big source, isn't it, for the stories of the golden peace. Now, one interesting thing about this which might have occurred to people listening is 250 BC is very late. So we are now well into the Henistic era, aren't we? So the era following the death of Alexander the Great and we'll come back to that later in the show, but just take us through the Argonautica and because a lot of the elements from the film are in the poem, right? >> Yeah. So uh Taos, the the the giant bronze man, you know, who picks up the ship, uh the harpies, the clashing rocks, the Spartoy, the sewn men, they're all in the Argonautica. So in Appalonius's poem, it's not Aes who sews the dragon's teeth. It's Jason. And Jason is as he does it is drawing a plow that is being pulled by fireb breathing bulls. >> Right? >> And the reason for this is that it's been set as a challenge by Aites who doesn't want to give him the golden fleece. And so basically has said if you draw this plow with the fire breathing bulls and you sew the dragon's teeth and you live to tell the tale then I will give you the golden fleece. And Jason gets away with it because Medadia, who is the daughter of 80s, priestess of um Hekarte, the uh the kind of the goddess of of magic and witchcraft and so on, has fallen in love with him. And she gives Jason a magic ointment. >> So a sports unuent >> which he smears all over himself and it make it's fire resistant so he he can cope with the fire breathing bulls. It has a kind of incredible cocaine style effect on his self-confidence because Jason in the in the epic is actually he's a bit of a wuss. >> So he needs a bit of a top up. He gets away with it. He he he manages to um to to draw the plow. Fire breathing bulls don't incinerate him and all of that. And she's also the one who advises him to pull Cadmus' trick by throwing a stone into the middle of the sewn men. So the story of Jason plowing the field with the fire breathing bulls, that's a very old one. the idea that the dragon's teeth then sprout up. This is Appalonius's invention. He explains it by saying that Athena after Cadmas had killed the dragon took its teeth and divided them up. So half to Cadmas and half got given to 80s. >> So a bit of kind of retrospective continuity there. >> Yes. Yes. And you can see that there is something I think quite Hollywood about this. Appalon is basically I mean you could imagine him writing for movie franchises or whatever. The Argonautica is basically the model for all the adventures of Greek heroes that you get in children's books, tales of daring dew, fights with monsters, all of that. It's not, as our previous episodes have been about, it's not about exploring the nature of the gods, plumbing, the uh the various dimensions of Dionis or any of that. He's very very concerned to write something that people will find page turning and exciting and interesting and and he it works. I mean it is a kind of thrilling story to read >> but it's not just a thrilling story is it because Appalonius so Appalonius is a he's a great poet but he's also a scholar who knows loads about Greek myths. So actually the comparison might be with a figure like JRI who's taking established myths and weaving them into you know throwing loads of elements in and creating a quest narrative that turns out to be a massive blockbuster. No, >> I think he is more I'm surprised you didn't bring it up. I think he's more like a script writer for a film in the Star Wars franchise. >> But I only did that because I know you hate you hate Star Wars. >> No, I'm happy I'm happy to have Star Wars introduced because I think it's it's quite a good parallel. >> Okay. >> You know, with with Star Wars, you you have a kind of pre-existing universe where there are certain characters and certain plot lines, but you can kind of mess around with it. You can introduce new characters. You can take elements from one film and put it into another. And you can do that with kind of superhero films as well, can't you? >> You can. He is much more like a script writer for a Marvel film than he is a a Greek tragedian. >> So he's basically taking elements from the the comic books that people, you know, have grown up with and they know and love and reworking them and throwing new things in and all of that stuff, right? >> Well, so think of Star Wars. You had those famously terrible prequels, didn't you? I am the princess of Nibou and I have come to negotiate a tariff reduction or something. I mean, unbelievably boring, but it's a prequel to the famous, you know, the the the kind of iconic Star Wars. Appalonius is doing something very similar because basically he's writing a prequel to the most famous of all Greek epics, which is which are Homers. We see Achilles, who's going to be the hero of the Iliad, as a little baby in the Arnautica. >> Oh my god. Anakin Skywalker, >> Darth Vader as a little boy. It's that kind of thing. >> This is the phantom menace of Greek mythology. That is the most damning thing you could possibly say about it. It's much better than that when the Argonauts they've get got the golden fleece and they're sailing away from Culus and they take a mad route to get back to Greece um along the Danube and the Ron and end up in the western Mediterranean. >> Yeah. Don't go. That's bonkers. >> Which by tradition is where Adysius sailed. And so this gives Appalonius the chance to have the Argonauts meet all kinds of characters and monsters that Adysius will go on to meet. They pass the sirens for instance. Um and Adysius gets tied to the mast so he can hear the sirens. But when the Argonauts go by, they've got Orpheus, who is the greatest musician who's ever lived, and he plays the liar, and he out sings the sirens. And also, you meet Cersei, who in the Odyssey turns um Adysius's men into pigs. >> And then Adysius kind of hangs out with him, and she turns out to be um Medadier's aunt. So, it's like bit like Darth Vader turning out to be Luke's father. I you impressed with my incredible >> amazing knowledge of Star Wars knowledge. >> Yeah. Incredible. And so I think part of the fun of reading the Aronautica, if you know anything about Greek myths, >> seeing the familiar elements, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. It's like, oh, there's Jaba the Hut and the Ewoks are back and his C3PO making his inevitable appearance. You know, that's basically what it is. >> But having said that, for that reason, I think just as people are kind of a bit sniffy perhaps about Star Wars prequels, people were sniffy about the Argonautica as well. The charge that Appalonius was a scavenger and a plagiarist was one that that followed him throughout his career. Traditionally, it is said that and I knew that your hackles always arise when I it is said that. >> Yeah. So, it didn't Yeah. >> But let's let's say for now that this is genuinely happened. He had as his critic the most admired and celebrated poet of the age was a guy called Calimicus, >> right? And Appalonius is writing, you know, an epic. It's full of uh monsters and so on. Calmicus is writing very delicate recondite poems. So if Appalonius is a script writer for a Star Wars prequel, Calimicus is more like TS Elliot or Emily Dickinson or >> if he's working in cinema, he's making little art house films 10 minutes long. >> Yes. And the reason for this is very self-conscious because we are no longer living in an age of epic and that trying to be Homer is is mad. You know, we can never do it. The circumstances that were germaine in Homer's age have completely vanished. You cannot help if you're going to try and write a homeriic epic. It will be pastiche. It will be kind of bombastic. It'll be kind of meatricious trash. >> Kyicus' nickname for Appalonius seems to have been the ibis. Um, and this is a bird that could be seen everywhere in Egypt, very common. And it had always fascinated Greek writers for reasons that Peter Green in his tremendous book on the Henistic period from Alexander to Actum. >> Remember that? I chose that as one of my >> Yeah. >> One of my f favorite history books from Al from Alexander to Actum. It's like 6,000 pages long. Peter Green lived to the age of 200, didn't he? Was still writing books like when other people have been long dead. Amaz brilliant historian >> and very very entertainingly written. So he explains why the ibis fascinated Greek writers. So this is Peter Green. The ibis was a foul feeder of gluttonous and indiscriminate veracity scavenging any kind of filth or carryion. It was also popularly believed to offset its diet by giving itself water enemas and colonic irrigation per anom with its own beak. Besides copulating orally, nesting in date palms to avoid cats and having a gut over 40 yards long. And he then goes on to quote the geographer Strabo who was writing in the the the reign of Augustus. Omniverous and unclean, the ibis is only with difficulty kept away from things that are clean themselves and alien to all defilement. So in other words, if we're to trust the tradition that Kyicus hated Appalonius >> by comparing Appalonius to an Ibis, he's essentially attacking the Argonautica not just as a kind of, you know, a mess of of scavenged bits of trash, but for poisoning the ancient pure springs of myth. And again, I think that is very like a kind of highbrow >> totally is >> critic of a Hollywood blockbuster. >> It's a guardian. It's a guardian film writer saying there are too many Marvel films and people should be watching more email Bergman. That's what it is. >> That's essentially what he's saying. >> And I think you know on one level you can see where Climicus is coming from because the story of the Argonauts I mean it it does draw on the the foundational springs of Greek myth. Homer doesn't mention Media, but he does specify that Cersei was sister to Aites. So, in fact, it wasn't Appalonius's invention that that Media was Cersei's niece. >> And equally, he doesn't mention the golden fleece, but he does mention Jason and specifically the clashing rocks. So, in in the Odyssey, when Cersei is warning Adysius about the clashing rocks and says, you know, avoid them at all cost, Cersei tells him that the Argo is the only ship that had ever passed through them. So to quote the Odyssey, the swells would have held her too against those gigantic rocks had her not sent her on through since Jason was dear to her. So Galore stepping in to save Jason. >> The rest of um Appalonius's epic is culled from kind of various poets. Um so uh Heidi is there. Um there's another poet from from Thieves called Pinda who wrote in the fifth century BC. Um and in Athens, Uripides uh friend of the show, author of the Baky, who we talked about in the previous episode. So Pinda, we know from him >> that the story had begun with this absolutely kind of classic fairy tale which revolves around a wicked stepmother who's out to get the two children of the king of Thesal who are called Frixus and Heli. And the brother and sister Frixus and Heli um they escape on a flying ram with a golden fleece. And the ram takes off from Thesily, flies over the Aian, flies over the Helellispont, and there there's a disaster because Ellie hasn't got her seat belt on and slips off and drowns in the stretch of water below. >> Yeah. Hence the name. >> Hence the name, the Hellellis. But Frixus gets um he crosses the Black Sea safely, lands in Culkus um and is given shelter by Aites. And when the the the flying golden ram dies, the fleece brings prosperity to Aet's kingdom. And so he hangs it on a tree in a sacred grove where it is looked after by a dragon. The the the dragon the great serpent wraps its coils around the tree. >> So this is all very familiar from the ladybird book of the Jason the Argonaut that I read when I was about five. >> And also I see that the the rest of the the details where Jason goes to get the fleece. They're also in the Ladybird book and they're from Pendar 2. Absolutely classic kind of Greek myth, isn't it? His father, what's his name? As the king of Yeah. Iolkos, >> he's been kicked out by his uncle, Pelus, when Jason was a baby. And Jason, obviously, it's always the way. He's been raised by a kind of wise old sage who is called Chiron and happens to be a centaur. >> Happens to be a centaur. But like, what's his name? The the the little gnome thing with a stupid voice. >> A come on. Are you talking about Yoda? >> Yoda? >> Yoda. So, yeah. So, so Chiron is the Yoda. >> Ignorant of Star Wars. Are you Tom Holland? >> Am I? No, that doesn't work, does it? >> No. >> Luke doesn't speak in the same Yoda's voice to Yoda. Come on. No. True. Okay. All right. Um, so meanwhile, back in Pelus, there's obviously a prophecy. I mean, there's always a prophecy. And he's been warned to beware a man with one sandal. and Jason um he's been instructed by uh by Chiron passed his A levels and so now it's time for him to set off to he's going along and there's a an old woman there's a swollen river the old woman can't get across the river so Jason gives her a piggy back at the far side the old woman transforms into Hia and this is why Ha from this point on is Jason's a great patron but Dominic while he's been crossing the river what do you think's happened to his footwear. >> Oh, his uh sandal has come off, hasn't it? Very famous. Yeah, >> sandal has come off. Yes. So, he turns up and Pelia sees this new arrival and realizes, oh my god, his trouble. So, he comes up with a brilliant scheme, which is that he tells Jason, "Look, I will give you the throne, but first of all, I really think that you should go to Kulkus and get the golden fleece." And people may be wondering, well, that's, you know, why would Jason do that? And Pedus comes up with three unanswerable reasons. The first of these is that the ghost of Frixus demands it. Say the little boy. >> Yeah, don't argue with him. >> The second is an oracle has urged it. >> So you can't argue with that. And the third is that just as the golden fleece has brought peace and prosperity to Kulkus, so if it gets stolen, then that peace and pro prosperity will be brought to Ikus. So unanswerable. Jason says, "Yeah, fine. Whatever." And Pelus swears a solemn vow that he will give Jason the throne if he comes back with the golden fleece. So to quote Pendar, so this was their agreement and then they parted and at once Jason ordered heralds everywhere to proclaim that a great voyage was to be made. And on the question of the the voyage, so I remember um Michael Wood did a TV series and Michael Wood who's been on our show, great TV historian called In Search of Myths and Heroes. And he went on this great sort of um expedition to Georgia on the other side of the Black Sea. And he was trying to sort of uncover the roots of the Golden Fleece myth. And he was sort of arguing, you know, the roots lie in memories of Greek voyages out into the unknown across the Black Sea to a land that might maybe had gold or some kinds of riches or or who knows. There is a sense, isn't there, among historians and scholars that the story of Jason the Golden Fleece does reflect a kind of historical reality which is what would you call it? The Greek age of exploration. A sense of colonization. >> Yeah. Going out. I mean, Greeks obviously go to the they go to the Crimea, don't they? They do go across the Black Sea to the far side. When is that time period because that must have been centuries distant by the time that people like well certainly by the time Appalonius is writing >> um 8th 7th centuries um right >> I mean into the sixth century and it's about a process of discovery and they are venturing out into seas where you could well believe that you'd come across clashing rocks or >> uh monsters or sirens or whatever. Um, so whether you're going westwards or eastwards, so it's a bit like the, you know, the the the stories told by Vikings sailing off into the Atlantic or you know, down the great rivers through Russia. Um, but the problem, and this is, I think, why Calimicus has a point, >> is that by 250 BC, I mean, everybody knows what the Mediterranean and the Black Sea are like. No one could conceivably believe that there are monsters there. And so that I think is why Appalonius sends the Argonauts into kind of middle middle Europa >> the R and whatnot. >> Yeah. Because they're generally people don't know what's going on there, >> right? >> So more opportunity for for monsters. >> So the one character who everybody remembers, Jason the Golden Fleece, the the the hypnotic figure of Media, the beautiful sorceress who helps Jason, but then obviously things go very very badly wrong for them as a couple. And where does that where does she come from? Does she come from Pindar as well? >> Yes. So Pindar provides Appalonius with the outline of her story. Um and in Pindar's account, Madira is a very heroic figure. So as in the film actually um and her aid is crucial to Jason's success. He wouldn't have been able to win the Golden Fleece without her. Aphroditi um Pindar says, you know, casts a spell of love over her. And in Appalonius's version, it's ridiculous. Aphrodite gets gets um OS her son to shoot an arrow and OS is like the kind of most annoy it's like scrappy do he's like a kind of infuriating child friendly character introduc I just terrible >> like Jar Binks >> yes he's the Jar Binks of uh Greek epic poetry and media is is you know she's got this arrow of love embedded in her heart it leads her to basically betray her father give Jason the magic ointment that enables him to, you know, harness the bulls and and and pep up his confidence. And also, Madia helps him to kill the dragon that's been guarding the golden feast. She has another ointment, puts it in the dragon's eyes, and the dragon falls asleep, and Jason then kills it. And on the long voyage back, she provides the Argonauts with magic, the prophecy. That basically is the outline that Pinda gives Appalonius, and and Appalonius kind of sticks to it. There is another much more famous literary portrayal of media that Appalonius had inherited and had to negotiate and this comes from Uripides. >> Yeah, we know that Uripides loves a really dark play >> and he loves he loves a murderous woman. >> Um and in in Uripides play about media, she is portrayed in in a very dark light and she is guilty of a sorted crime. So, in the backstory, she as the as the Argonauts escape, she's taken her her brother with her in in one account. As I fleet is closing in on the Argonauts, she chops her brother up into little pieces and throws it out into the sea. >> Such a weird and unsettling detail. >> So, has to stop to pick up the bits or uh in another account, the brother has been is leading the pursuit and media kills him. When they get back to Thessal, Pelas predictably does not hand over the throne. So Medadia eliminates him and she does it in a kind of brilliantly complicated way. She gets Pelus's daughters and she says, "Look, I have incredible powers of of of sorcery. Your father is very very elderly. I can make him much younger. Look." And she brews up a potion in a cauldron and she gets an aged ram and she slits the throat of the ram and then she chops the ram up into little bits. This is obviously something media is really into is chopping up bodies. and she chucks all the portions of the the ram into the cauldron and there's kind of shimmering and a flash and then a minute later the ram pops out and it's now a baby lamb kind of had all its youth restored to it and she says if you do this to your father then I'll be able to do the same and so Pelus's daughters get their father slit his throat chop him into bits chuck him into the cauldron and nothing happens and that's the end of Pelus so Jason then can become king of Icus and and Thessaly um and you'd think that he'd be very grateful to media. But by this point, Jason is thinking, you know, she's a bit of a nightmare. She's just, you know, endlessly chopping people up. And fatefully in Uripides version, he dumps Medadia for a princess called Gl, who's the princess of Corinth. >> And so Medadia doesn't take this lying down, and she sends Glac a poison dress and and crown. And Gl puts it on and vanishes in a puff of smoke. Um, and Medadia then goes off, kills the two sons that she's had by Jason, thereby denying him, you know, any male heirs, and flies off in a chariot drawn by dragons and goes to Athens. >> She's a piece of work, isn't she? She's the Mary Lincoln of Greek mythology, Tom. >> So harsh. So harsh. Uh, so >> I hope the people on the Reddit enjoy that one. Continue. >> Basically, Uripides's influence is so strong. He's become such a kind of classic by this point that this is now the canonical understanding of media, but it doesn't really suit Appalonius's purposes. I mean, it's it's too too bloodstained, too murderous. And so, essentially, he kind of slightly whitewashes that out. >> I mean, that is so Hollywood, you know, oh, we want to take >> it's like it's like the Yeah, it's like the um the Adam West Batman. >> You know, all the dark stuff. >> I'm just going to say it first before the before the listeners do. There's a lot of ludicrous parallels being made in this episode. >> No, I think it's not. >> But we lean into it. We love it. >> Europeid Sophocles, Escilus, the great tragedians, they have become classics and they have put later poets in their shadow. And Appalonius, you know, has this anxiety of influence. He's always conscious of it. And that is really Kimicus' point is that you can't write something fresh about media because we have these, you know, the Uripides portrait means that you're always going to be operating in its shadow. And the only thing that appalonies can do basically is to ignore that, set it aside. >> And there's a kind of parallel I think in which the way that um poets in say you know 250 BC are in the shadow of a vanished greatness, literary greatness. Politically, Athens is slightly similar because Athens now in 250 BC stands in the shadows of empires that are vastly greater than the empire that the Athenians had run in the fifth century. And the independence of Athens and of all the other Greek city states has effectively been snuffed out and dominate. I mean, you know, you know, by whom. >> Yeah. No one loves this more than I do. I love I love to see the Athenians get a kicking from Macedon. So, Philip of Massedan started it, didn't he? In 338. He uh smashed the Athenians and the Theans. And then four years later, Alexander the Great, one of the very top friends of the rest is history, he'd gone off on his on his I think what we described as a gap year that got out of control. Uh conquering the Persian Empire, going off to Afghanistan, >> dressing up in his his foreign clothing. >> Exactly. Exactly. Taking proskinesis, adopting Persian customs, goes off to Central Asia, goes off to India, and then he dies in 323 and his empire is carved up. And it's always sort of said, oh, it fragmented into these pitiful little successor states. But actually those successor states are pretty powerful and rich empires, the Sukid Empire, the Tomic Empire. And I guess the most glamorous certainly for me, and it's the place when people say, "Where would you go if you had a time machine, you classic rest is history club, Alexandria, it's Alexandria rather than Athens, that is the real metropolis in this period, isn't it?" The sort of the city of culture, of science. >> It's a mega city. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously founded by Alexander, named after him with Alexander's customary modesty. And the thing about Alexandria as opposed to Athens or thieves with their kind of ancient stories about their their beginnings and their ancient relations with the gods and heroes is that on the site of Alexandria before Alexander arrived there had there had been nothing. There was only kind of marshes and and seabirds of North Africa. >> Yeah. No temples, no festivals and crucially no myths. And so then that there's an obvious question. What do the ancient gods mean in a city where everyone is an immigrant? Um what relevance do these ancient Greek poems now have? And I think that that's what the argument between Kyicus and Appalonius is all about. Neither of them come from Greece, old Greece. Climus had moved there from Sirene which is a city in what's now Libya. And Appalonius himself despite his name Appalonius of roads seems actually to have been born in Alexandria. and he was called off roads cuz he liked visiting there. Can Alexandria be a place? What role does Smith have in such a city? >> Yeah. >> And and I I think that Cyicus' charge against Appalonius therefore is very clear and not unjustified, which is that if you're going to write an ancient epic and you are doing so as a citizen of a paranu mega city like Alexandria, then you can't help but be kind of vulgar and meritious. I suppose it's slightly again like you know highbrow British attitudes towards American films. >> Right. Exactly. But it's also interestingly it mirrors the criticism that historians for a long time have actually made of the Henistic era, haven't they? Historians and and critics really since the 19th century been holding up Greece, the classical age of Greece as the model have then said, "Oh, and what came next was vulgar and meatricious and and a bit of a pastiche." And I mean that's the that's the classic criticism of Henistic culture. >> But just to reiterate, I mean that is the criticism that Kyus is making who is probably the greatest. >> He's anticipating it. Yeah. Calyus is looking back to to to Athens and to Homer as the true golden age of Greek literature. Yeah. And and you know we do the same by and large that that tends to be the assumption >> you do. I actually love the Hellenistic era. I prefer >> I love I love the Henistic era too, but I can recognize that there is a point to Kimicus' >> criticism that it is slightly Özats. The >> you don't like multiculturalism like I do. >> No, Dominic. There is an Özat quality to trying to write an epic about a corner of the world that everyone knows is there and saying that it's full of monsters. But >> to stick up for Appalonius, Appalonius obviously thinks that it's an entirely legitimate what he's doing because otherwise he wouldn't write his epic >> of course. >> And he thinks that Kyicus is the idiot. So like you and he wrote this oneline poem which is kind of structured like an entry in an encyclopedia and he sums up Kyicus as trash, a cheap joke, a blockhead. >> I love Appalonia. certainly sounds brilliant. It's exactly what I would do. >> And I think that his defense of the Argonautica wouldn't just have been that it's, you know, a thrilling page turner. What's wrong with a thrilling page turner? You know, they're great. >> Um, but also he would say he's doing something much more with it. And specifically what he is doing he would say I think is that he is adapting myth you know this great inheritance of the stories of the gods and the heroes to the age of Alexander's successors which is an age of of um global horizons of kings who claimed to be gods and of teeming mega cities that had not existed when you know Sophocles let alone Homer was writing their masterpieces. is all right. Well, let's take a break, Tom, and then when we come back after the break, let's look at talk about Alexander and his influence on uh what we come to call Greek mythology. And let's look at what happens to this corpus of Greek stories and the way the Greeks understand the supernatural in the wake of Alexander's conquests. This episode is brought to you by Uber.

Alexander the Great, of course, um was famously devoted to the stories of Greek myth and legend. So there's a story, isn't there, that he travels with a copy of the Iliad, a sort of very fancy Folio Society edition of the Iliad that he puts under his pillow. And he clearly is a very god-fearing or godsfearing man because when he crosses the helispond, for example, he builds an altar to the 12 Olympians. And he is obsessed particularly with Achilles. I mean, he thinks of himself and his friend Histian as the modernday Achilles and Petroolis and he takes all this incredibly seriously, doesn't he, Tom? >> He does. Um, he he comes to think that he's literally the son of Zeus. >> Yeah. He goes to the oracle of Siwa. >> Yeah. When he reaches what's now Afghanistan, he he he sees traces all around him of Dianisis, who was supposed to have traveled there many, many centuries before. So he sees kind of stone burial heaps that are covered with ivy and and ivy was sacred to Dianisis. And so Alexander assumes that these were boundary stones that have been set up by the god. Alexander's ambition is to go even further than than Dianisis. So to quote Arian, the Roman historian writing in the second century AD, he confidently expected his troops would join him in this done as it would be in imitation of Dianisis's achievements. But Dominic that doesn't happen, does it? >> No. So he's never defeated but he's defeated by his own men uh in India on the river Hyphasis. They force him to turn back in 326. Yet again he builds an altar to the gods. I mean Alexander he he does he loves doing two things basically founding cities called Alexandria building altars and then he goes back to Babylon and 3 years later he's dead in Babylon probably malaria possibly a poison. Um we can't be sure. Or is he Tom? Is he dead? So Alexander is obviously angling to be worshiped as a god and this is a conceit that is treated with absolute contempt by say the Athenians. I mean they see this as a example of insane megalamania. But the thing is it doesn't actually take long for the Athenians to hail one of Alexander's successors in person as a god. So um not long after Alexander's death, only a few decades in 295, you have this Macedonian strongman called Demetrius the Besieure, which I always thought was a brilliant subreet. Yeah. >> Polyocates, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. >> And he comes to Athens and occupies it and he addresses the Athenians in the theater of Dianisis where the tragedies have been staged. And he appears there as though he is, you know, a hero or maybe even a god kind of deexmina appearing there. And four years later he comes back to Athens and is overtly greeted as though he were Dianisis as though you know he has appeared as though it's the anthisteria >> and he's accompanied into Athens by dancers carrying giant fallaces and the Athenians hail him with this this kind of poem. The other gods are far distant or have no ears or do not exist or ignore us but you could we can see before us. You are not made of stone or wood. No, you are real. And they hail Demetrius as sot, as savior. And they allow him to live with his mistress in a back room of the pathonon up on the Acropolis, the the great temple to Athena on on the Acropolis. And Demetrius very modestly begins to refer to Athena as his sister. >> And that's just that's just not his own ego, right? Because this is becoming a trend across the Henistic world. And I'm wondering a lot of this must come from Egypt, from the Tomies who are being worshiped as gods. And actually Tommy the first calls himself soda, doesn't he? The savior. He does. So this is becoming a trend for kings, would you say, across the Hellenistic era to identify themselves with the gods? >> And I think you're right that it's part of a kind of cultural soup. But I think it's also reflecting a sense that the Olympians are not there for people in their kind of hour of need. That the old rituals and cults that had seemed to um keep Athens in the favor of the gods are no longer functioning. The corollery of this in turn is a kind of growing public skepticism among intellectuals about the Olympians full stop. So there is one book in particular that becomes an absolute bestseller in exactly this period and you can see why when I tell you what it seem is. It's written by a philosopher called and he comes up with a kind of very novel explanation for the ancient myths. He's a kind of Graeme Hancock of the ancient world and he wrote this book is called the sacred register and in it uhemerous claims that he'd been sent on a diplomatic mission by one of the Macedonians to an island in the Indian Ocean and there he had found an inscription written in hieroglyphics and this is the sacred register. So it's very Graeme Hancock >> and the sacred register reveals a bombshell truth which is that Zeus hadn't been a god at all. he'd been a mortal king of Cree who after his death had come to be worshiped as a god and that this was true of all the other Olympians as well. They all they would all been mortals and they'd been raised up to the heavens. And the popularity of this thesis suggests just how large a market there has come to be by the 3rd century BC for works of philosophy that it's no longer the kind of rishe habit that had been under Plato. it's becoming kind of becoming part of the mainstream. >> So actually to go back to the last episode where we were talking about philosophers establishing themselves in opposition to poets and storytellers. Initially they were out there in their little you know their academy outside the city but their ideas have clearly percolated more deeply over the centuries and now would it be an exaggeration to say that by and large now in the hellistic era if you are a self-respecting intellectual in other words if you're the kind of person who's hanging around at the museon in Alexandria you are skeptical about the stories of the Olympians and you say come on this stuff is obviously rubbish there aren't people with the heads of this and turning themselves into eagles and sleeping with women. That's obviously rubbish. >> Yes, I think it is. And again, I mean, it's a, you know, all all comparisons are have their their problems, but perhaps there's a slight element of the way in which most intellectuals would be embarrassed to say that they believe that God became a baby and was born from a virgin. That kind of thing. >> Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah. And a bit like with the the rejection of institutional Christianity today by intellectuals, the the rejection of the the stories told of the Olympian gods by intellectuals in the Henistic world is often cast as a kind of triumph of reason over superstition and of you know self-examination over blind faith. But this itself is a myth because just as intellectuals today who think that they have rejected you know the superstitions of the past actually are merely propagating new forms of that superstition. >> So you can see in the henistic world the rejection of what philosophers come to cast as superstition breeds its own superstitions. >> Okay. Interesting. So I and I would say that what is happening in the hellistic world is that kind of notions of the supernatural that have been appropriate to a world of of small city states is now being adapted to a kind of vast globalized one with mega cities. >> Right? >> The classic example of what this meant in practice, a guy called Epicurus, who is the son of Athenian settlers on Seamos. He'd been a boy back when Alexander had crossed the helispont and he ends up in Athens where he teaches a vision of the universe that is very atomistic. He teaches that that everything is made up of atoms and in due course this will make him a great hero of rethinkers and skeptics in the enlightenment. But Epicurus is absolutely not an atheist and he you know still less a kind of rationalist. He did believe in gods. It's just that the the gods he believed in were gods who didn't intervene in human affairs and did not control the destiny of the world and his interest in the natural world. So all this kind of stuff about atoms and things. You know it's not because he's some kind of protoscientist. That is absolutely not what Epicurus is about. To this day there are rationalists who say oh Epicurus he's brilliant. You know he's a kind of protoc. He's the opposite. The only reason Epicurus has for researching the nature of things is is to appreciate the pointlessness of believing in myths and this is because in turn it will lead to the state of tranquility ataraxia in Greek that Epicurus sees as being the ultimate goal of existence. So effectively what he's doing is saying turn on tune in drop out. It's a completely radical rejection of the assumptions of classical Athens. And that's why, you know, there's a lot of hostility towards Epicurus. But it's not like he's saying go out and become a, you know, invent nuclear physics or or something like that. He's basically, I mean, basically he he's less Richard Dawkins. He's much more than Maharishi, >> right? He's somebody who says um sort of uh ignore all the silly rituals and stuff of of the stuffy squares. What we need to He's like the kind of person who drops out to become a Buddhist in the 1960s. Is that basically what it is? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Well, you know, Buddhism is a kind of noble ancient tradition. There's a strong element of the charlatan about Epicurus. >> Oh, so he's a he's like a somebody talking about new age crystals, that kind of thing. >> He's a profounder philosopher than that. I mean, there are Epicurans to this day who will not like that categorization. Um, you know, so all the all the the papyrie scrolls in Herculanium that are starting to be deciphered now are by Epicurans, which is slightly frustrating. But Epicurus himself, I mean, there are definite qualities of, you know, the guru. So he sets up effectively a commune in Athens which is funded by his wealthy admirers. Epicurus is not remotely in favor of allowing his followers to think for themselves. So he his dictim is always act always as though Epicurus is watching. So he's a kind of big brother, right? >> Um and his admirers while he's alive call him the leader and then when he dies they call him sot savior. >> My god. So he really is like a cult leader. >> You know this is an age where people are looking for a savior. And when he dies, I mean, considering that Epicurus had absolutely rejected the notion of interventionist gods, I mean, Epicurus is he's remembered very much like an interventionist god. So, he he while he was alive, he'd referred to his body as being something holy. Um, he demanded the first fruits from his followers. So, that's, you know, the first the first fruits of the harvest, which is conventionally what you pay to the Olympian gods. >> And then after his death, they hold commemorative feasts. So he's kind of, you know, it's it's looking back to the Olympian gods. It's looking forward to the kind of the way that Christians will commemorate Christ. Epicurus is not an embodiment of enlightened rationalism. I think it's fair to say. And you know, there's that famous comment Chesterton makes that that you and you can adapt it that when the the Greeks choose not to believe in the Olympians, it's not that they don't believe in, you know, they don't believe in nothing. They become capable of believing in anything basically. So to go back to Jason the Argonaut. So what that's reflecting therefore is an age where where there's a genuine kind of a massive flux of ideas where the old institution the more the old sort of rituals and assumptions have lost some of their power over people and people are picking and choosing much more as they walk through in like 1970s America or something. >> They're questing. They're searching. They're searching for meaning. >> Yes. Exactly. So kind of hanging out in a garden and dropping out is is one option. There's another option which is hinted at quite strongly in Yehmoris's book because Yehemis I mean he's not an atheist either. >> He thinks that the Olympians are were originally mortals but he does think that there are gods but he thinks that the gods are planets. >> Um and this is another thing that is obviously influenced by Egyptian Babylonian traditions. you know, the Greek kings of of Egypt and of um you know, the Salucids, they have access to this kind of very very ancient astronomical astrological inheritance. And so this is a way in which the Olympians actually kind of make a a return for Greek intellectuals is that um the planets come to be identified with the Greek gods. So, the swiftest planet is the planet that comes to be called Hermes, the messenger of the gods, and the Romans call Mercury, and we still call it Mercury to this day. The brightest, most beautiful planet, Aphroditi, aka Venus. The bloodiest planet, the planet that's the color of blood is Ara, the god of war, or Mars. And of course, the largest planet, that's the king of the gods, Zeus, or as we call it, Jupiter. But the thing is that the rule of these planetary Olympians is much much more tyrannical than the rule of the traditional Olympian gods had been because the planets can't be swayed by festivals or by you know sacrifices or anything like that. They're completely indifferent. They're chill. The doom that's written in the stars if you believe in astrology is something that you can't escape. And >> there's always been an element of fatalism. There's always been an element of fatalism in the Greek understanding of of the divine and what not, hasn't there? But it's become more pronounced now, would you say? >> I think if you're if you if you believe that your fate is locked into the stars, all you can do the best you can do is to try and learn what it is by becoming a massive kind of astrology fan. But there is an even bleeaker possibility which also becomes very widespread in this period that there is no order at all and that the greatest of all gods is Taik. So Greek for for fate for fortune. >> Um and that there is therefore you know there's no pattern there. There's no logos. There's no possibility of fathoming an order in the universe because there isn't one. Um so an Athenian poet put it in kind of very devastating terms. It's not logos which guides the affairs of mortals but Tiki. So you were saying this is an age where people are looking around for answers and solutions and some of these answers and solutions are very bleak. So, >> you know, I think astrology is very bleak. It it tells you what's going to happen. There's nothing you can do to affect it. And if you think that um that Tiki is the goddess that controls everything, then you know, a philosopher sums it up well. Her influence on on our lives is as beyond computation as the manifestations of her power are unpredictable. And yet, so we've been talking about philosophers, but what do the people in the streets of Athens or Alexandria in the taverns in the marketplaces, what do they think? Because there's always a danger when we're talking about belief that we we overemphasize the the importance of that minority of people who really really care about these things and talk about them a lot, but most people of course don't. They're interested in the price of bread or whatever. So Jason the Argonauts would not have been so successful presumably unless there were loads of punters who loved this kind of thing and who genuinely thought that it had meaning presumably. The old rituals that had sustained the independent Greek city states carry on even though they're no longer independent. And for for some you know it becomes like the equivalent of the trooping of the color or bastile day. Uh I mean that's kind of the limit of it. But I think for lots of people they they they do continue to feel that the gods are imminent and that by practicing these rituals and these festivals they are in communion with the gods. But I think also there are intellectuals who clearly miss the gods who love them and Appalonius would be representative of that. Appalonius when he writes the Argonautica is not doing it as a hick. He's not doing it as someone who doesn't understand exactly what he's doing because he like kymicus is a very very great scholar and they are both employed in the greatest of all the kind of research institutes that the hellenistic period throws up and we've done an episode on it namely the library of Alexandria. So Kyicus is the guy as well as writing reconite poetry he's drawn up the catalog of the library you know absolutely massive product and Appalonius is an academic specialist on Homer so when he's writing a you know an epic on the homeic model he knows what he's talking about he's an abs you know he's been involved in drawing up the kind of the canonical text of Homer which is something that that scholars in Alexandria are really keen on doing it he does it so well that he ends up becoming the chief librarian of Alexandria and he pips Kimicus to job. And so that's why although there is skepticism among some scholars about the idea of this literary rivalry between the two men, I think there was because I think that's exactly the kind of thing that would have prompt you know they would have absolutely hated each other and and so you can see that the Argonautica even though it's a rollic good read and tremendous entertainment it is also something else. It is a study a logos of myths. So it is a mythologia right >> and so what is happening in Alexandria with people like Appalonius is that myth is becoming mythology. >> So just distinguish for us what you mean by the difference between myth and mythology. So is the difference maybe that mythology is more self-conscious and nostalgic and backwardlooking. >> Do you think >> it's the study of myths? >> Right. It's the the telling of myths with an awareness of their backstory and that you are doing it in a kind of a literary or scholarly manner. So, you know, a children's book is a collection, you know, is a work of mythology or telling mythology. >> The writer doesn't believe any of it is drawing kind of various elements and putting them together to tell a good story. But at its highest level, it results in extraordinary works of literature. And this is how the myths pass into the bloodstream of European culture. So the Romans are writing mythology. So Virgil when he adapts Homer to tell this great epic drawing on stories of the Trojan War and the Odyssey that explains the beginning the origins of Rome. The Anid is a work of mythology. >> Right. Virgil doesn't think it's real. Virgil is there's a slight maybe um a tiny bit of an antiquarian element to it almost. >> There is an antiquarian element. I mean whether he thinks it's real or not is a complicated >> question but but it's it's not summing up myth for the Romans in the way that Homer defines myth for the Greeks and you have Ovid as well who writes this great collection of stories of of transformations metamorphoses or writers and artists through the middle ages the Renaissance into the modern period is the great storehouse of Greek myth it's you know it's the storehouse that Shakespeare draws on Tishan, Jason the Argonauts, uh, children's, you know, Percy Jackson, all of that. That's how the myths >> endure >> because you can't if you have mythology, you have myth. The myth is embedded within the mythology. >> But also, don't they endure? Because, you know, so many I know you hate using the word religion, but I'm just going to use it very loosely. So many ancient religions were defined through through ritual, through tradition, through ritual, through practice. But what makes the Greek myths for one of a better word distinctive is their stories. They began as as poems. And that that's why they endure in a way that the stories of the Babylonians or the Egyp or even the Egyptians, you know, they seem unsatisfying to us in a in a way that the Greek myths aren't because they were ritualistic rather than literary. The Greek myths were always literary. >> Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And I think that's why they appeal to children and they appeal to, you know, famous intellectuals like nature and Freud and they've served as an inspiration to great writers and artists in a way that no other mythology has done. >> Yeah. >> Um and they they continue to this day and that's why we can do you know a series on Greek myths >> possibly the Norse myths because they also have come down to us purely as stories rather than as performance or ritual. But I think that's slightly different because the the Greek myths are coming from the molten heart of belief. >> The the Norse epics are written long after >> Yeah. of course belief in the gods and so they're kind of they have all kinds of contaminations. >> Yeah. >> That explains their potency. There is a drawback though which is that because it's mediated for us by by mythology by people who are studying it in a kind of slightly abstract way and because over the course of the generations and the centuries it's been perpetuated by people who do not believe any of it at all >> and that's the inheritance that we get. It is difficult for us because our assumptions tend to be materialist and and Christian you know we have we have kind of a cultural overlay. It is difficult for us to get back into the mindset of the Greeks themselves to get back into the the age of of of Sophocles and Uripides and still more of of Homer. But I think you cannot properly understand the Greeks without trying to imagine yourself in a world where the gods are the primary actors in the life of the various Greek cities and in the cosmos more generally because it's only then that we we can properly see how the Greeks saw themselves. >> Yeah. And that's the that's the huge I I increasingly think that about the classical period of Greece and and the centuries before it is that the challenge is to try and imagine yourself back into a world where you can escape the mythology and re-enter a world of myth to put it like that. >> Very nice. Very nice way to sum it up, Tom. But actually an even better way would be for me to ask you your favorite myth. Top myth. My favorite myth was always the Odyssey. >> Really? >> Yeah. I always loved the Odyssey because it was it was my gateway drug. >> Yeah. Okay, fair enough. >> And I would love to do an episode at some point on the Odyssey. We did we did we did one on with Daniel Mandlesson, but that's only for the club members and club members can get it at the rest is history.com. >> Very good. >> Um but those who don't we maybe we could do one for for the general listener. >> I think we should absolutely do one for the general listener to give people an insight into the ruthless way in which we conduct our affairs. I think we should do that when Christopher Nolan's film at the Odyssey comes out. >> Yeah, let's do that. >> I think we should do a series that Rest is History subscribers will be able to hear first. >> That's a very very good plan. Very good plan. >> Now you see the way now people get a little glimpse behind the curtain and they see the way in which we plan these things with no regard to commercial motives whatsoever. >> We're like the Olympians, aren't we? >> Yeah. >> Kind of drawing up rules and creatures of whim, but also of power. Uh Dominic, before we go, you asked me my favorite Greek myth. That's yours. >> Thesius, >> because that was my gateway. That was the first one I read. Thesius and the uh and going at the labyrinth, fighting the monitor and all that. I love all that. The black sails. >> We can do one on Cre as well. >> Cre. Well, Cret surely is is serious waiting to happen. >> It is. Right. It is. >> This basically the episode has turned into auling meeting, which is like that. >> We're back, aren't we, with um an episode on someone who's very into the classics, uh namely Enoch Powell. Wow. That's a that's a good segue. >> That's a a thrilling transition, isn't it? >> And then after that, we've got we've got a um a woman who is very into acting out the Greek myths, namely Emma Hamilton, who goes on to become Nelson's great paramore. Uh and then after that, we have the return of the admiral himself, Nelson. >> I can't wait. Cannot wait. Right. And that bombshell. Thank you so much, Tom. That was absolutely fascinating. Brilliant. A tour force. We haven't had a tour for us for a while, but now we've had a really good one. >> Brilliant. Thank you. >> Bye-bye. >> Bye-bye.
