**Detailed Analysis:**

## 1. The Assassination and Immediate Aftermath

***"Now he belongs to the ages."***

The assassination occurred at Ford's Theatre on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, just five days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox. The theatre was packed with celebrating Union soldiers and citizens. John Wilkes Booth, a well-known Shakespearean actor and Confederate sympathizer, shot Lincoln at point-blank range during a comedic line in "Our American Cousin" at approximately 10:15 PM. The Derringer pistol shot to the back of Lincoln's head was initially mistaken for a stabbing due to Booth's theatrical waving of a dagger as he leaped 12 feet from the presidential box to the stage.

Major Henry Rathbone, who was in the box with the Lincolns, attempted to stop Booth but was slashed with a knife, severing an artery in his arm. Booth escaped through the theatre's back door onto a waiting horse. Two young doctors, Charles Leale and Charles Taft, immediately attended to Lincoln, discovering the bullet wound only after initially searching for stab wounds. They determined Lincoln could not survive the journey to the White House and moved him to the Petersen boarding house across the street.

## 2. Lincoln's Death and National Mourning

***"Those strong and brave men wept when I met them."***

Lincoln died at 7:22 AM on April 15, 1865, after surviving through the night in a comatose state. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton took charge of the scene, famously declaring "Now he belongs to the ages" at the moment of death. Mary Lincoln was forcibly removed from the room during his final moments after Stanton shouted, "Take that woman out and do not let her in here again."

The national response was unprecedented in American history. **Crowds of mourners, particularly African Americans**, gathered outside the White House in overwhelming grief. Lincoln's funeral was held in the East Room on April 19th - coincidentally the anniversary of the first Civil War deaths. His body was escorted by the 22nd United States Colored Infantry as it lay in state at the Capitol. The two-week rail journey returning his body to Illinois deliberately retraced his 1861 inaugural route. **Five million people** lined the tracks or queued to view the coffin at various stops. The religious significance of his death on Good Friday was widely noted, with many drawing parallels to Christ's crucifixion.

## 3. The Broader Conspiracy

***"Their plan is to decapitate the northern leadership."***

The assassination was part of a larger conspiracy to destroy Union leadership. **George Atzerodt** was assigned to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson but lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking instead. **Lewis Powell** and **David Herold** targeted Secretary of State William Seward at his Lafayette Square home. Powell gained entry claiming to deliver medicine, then attacked Seward with a knife. Though Seward survived due to a neck brace from a recent carriage accident, Powell stabbed five people total before escaping, shouting "I'm mad! I'm mad!"

All conspirators were eventually captured. Atzerodt, Powell, Herold, and **Mary Surratt** (who ran a Confederate safe house) were convicted and hanged. Surratt became the first woman executed in American history. The conspiracy had evolved from an earlier plan to kidnap Lincoln and exchange him for Confederate prisoners, demonstrating the desperation of Confederate sympathizers as the war concluded.

## 4. The Manhunt for John Wilkes Booth

***"After being hunted like a dog through swamps, woods, and last night being chased by gunboats, till I was forced to return wet, cold, and starving with every man's hand against me."***

Booth escaped Washington by crossing the Anacostia River bridge around 11:30 PM, convincing Sergeant Silas Cobb to let him pass despite the curfew. He rode 60 miles that first night with a fractured leg from his theatrical leap. The Union Army immediately mobilized, sealing roads south and offering a **$100,000 reward** - an astronomical sum for the era.

Booth and Herold first stopped at Mary Surratt's tavern in Surrattsville to collect rifles and supplies. By 4 AM, they reached Dr. Samuel Mudd's home, where Booth received medical treatment for his fractured fibula. After learning of Lincoln's death, Mudd forced them to leave. The fugitives became lost in swamps, eventually hiring a freed Black man named Oswald Swann to guide them for $12.

For four days, they hid in a pine thicket while Confederate agent Thomas Jones brought food and newspapers. Booth was enraged that newspapers condemned rather than celebrated his actions. In his journal, he wrote comparing himself to Brutus and William Tell, lamenting: **"I struck for my country and that alone... And yet now behold the cold hand they extend to me."**

## 5. Booth's Final Stand

***"Useless, useless."***

After two failed attempts to cross the Potomac River due to fog and disorientation, Booth and Herold finally reached Virginia on April 22. They continued south, at one point forcing a Black family, the Lucases, from their cabin at knifepoint. On April 24, they arrived at Richard Garrett's tobacco farm, Locust Hill, posing as wounded Confederate soldiers.

The Garretts became suspicious when Booth panicked at news of Union cavalry nearby. Believing them to be horse thieves, they locked the fugitives in their tobacco barn overnight. At 2 AM on April 26, the 16th New York Cavalry surrounded the barn. Detective Luther Byron Baker demanded surrender, threatening to burn the barn. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused, requesting "a chance for a fair fight."

As the barn burned, **Sergeant Boston Corbett** - a religious fanatic and eunuch who had castrated himself with scissors - shot Booth through the neck, severing his spinal column. Booth survived for hours, repeatedly whispering "Tell my mother that I did it for my country." As dawn broke, his final words were "Useless, useless" before dying.

## 6. Impact on Reconstruction and Historical Assessment

***"Lincoln controls reconstruction. Black Americans are given the vote. The Confederates never regain control of the southern states."***

The assassination's impact on Reconstruction remains heavily debated. The common counterfactual suggests Lincoln would have managed Reconstruction more successfully, preventing Jim Crow laws and ensuring racial equality. However, this theory faces significant challenges. **Lincoln was already a lame-duck president facing massive Congressional opposition**, including from radical Republicans who considered his death "a godsend" because they believed he was too lenient toward the South.

The presidency lacked sufficient power to impose the long-term military regime necessary to enforce racial equality in the South. White Southern resistance through paramilitary groups like the Ku Klux Klan would have emerged regardless. Lincoln's own statements prioritized rapid reconciliation and restoration of the Union over immediate racial equality. The fundamental issues of racism and white supremacy were too deeply entrenched to be solved by one man's leadership.

Ironically, Booth's action achieved the opposite of his intentions - he transformed Lincoln into a martyr while hastening the very changes he sought to prevent. Like Brutus with Caesar, Booth failed to understand that assassination would strengthen rather than weaken his enemy's cause.
