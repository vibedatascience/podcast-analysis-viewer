Hello. A truly bakanalian orgy on today's rest is history. Frenzied wild screaming women, people being torn limb from limb, blood, bodily fluids, absolute ecstasy, but also the darkness of the god Dianisis and his rebels. And if that is not enough, we will also be discussing in no less than 5 minutes Plato, his philosophy, all you need to know about it, how it changed the way we think, how it changed the way we view the world. This podcast will genuinely change your life. So do not miss it under any circumstances. And for the avoidance of doubt, there is lots of orges and blood and stuff like that. So it's brilliant. This episode is presented by Adobe Express, the quick and easy create anything app. What does that mean? Well, say you need to make a presentation or a video or a social media post or a flyer. To some, certainly to me, that sounds intimidating. But Tom, with Adobe Express's intuitive features like templates, generative AI, and real time collaboration, it has never been easier. Adobe Express. Try it for free. Search Adobe Express in the App Store. Agave was foaming at the mouth. Her rolling eyes were wild. She was not in her right mind, but possessed by Bakus, and she paid no heed to Penthus. She grasped his left arm between wrist and elbow, set a foot against his ribs, and tore his arm off by the shoulder. It was no strength of hers that did it, but the god filled her and made it easy. On the other side, Ano was at him, tearing at his flesh. And now Alino joined them and the whole maniacal horde. A single and continuous yell arose. Penthus shrieking as long as life was left in him. The women howling in triumph. One of them carried off an arm, another a foot, the boot still laced on it. The ribs were stripped clawed clean. And women's hands thick red with blood were tossing, catching like a play thing. Penththeus's flesh. So that is the devastating climax of the most shocking, the most blood soaked and notorious of all Greek tragedies, the back eyee by the great Athenian dramatist Uripides. It's a terrible scene. Penthus is being ripped into pieces by these women possessed with the spirit of Bakus, as he describes it, and the little bits of his flesh are left scattered under rocks and over trees. Tom, you chose this lovely reading in the episode. Um, why? It's unbelievably dramatic. Um, and it I mean it reads like, you know, a kind of description from The Walking Dead or 28 Days Later. It has a kind of real zombie vibe. And the scene where this is happening is Mount Kithon which is the very same um mountain range south of thieves in central Greece where the infant Edypus in Sophocles play um which we talked about in the previous episode was taken from his parents' palace. So generally it's not it's a place where terrible things happen but the action in this play in the back eye with this poor man being torn to pieces um is set four generations before the time of Edypus. So, Penthus, the guy who's being torn to pieces, um he was the grandfather of Jakcasta, who was Edypus' mother, stroke wife. Um and he ruled as Edypus was going to rule in due course as um as the king of thieves. And we we highlighted in the previous episode how the Thean royal family is the most dysfunctional dynasty in the whole of Greek myth. And this episode absolutely sets the seal on this reputation because Agave, who you described ripping off Penthus's left arm, is Penthus' mother. My god. And I know and who are joining in the fun are his aunts. So it's, you know, as family rendevous go picnics up on the mountain. This is a very, very bad one. And what's going on here is not that they are, you know, you used your um the Walking Dead parallel. They're not zombies. Although in a kind of way they are, they have become possessed, haven't they? They've become ravers. I see in your notes. So, what's that? Minads. Minad. Yes. So, they've become what the Greeks called Minads. Literally ravers. And they have been gripped by um a frenzy that in Greek was called a baya. And when you join a bakaya, if you're a minad, you dress up in the skins of thorns or leopards and you roam the uplands up, you know, you leave the kind of the plains centers of civilization and go up into the hills and up there you either um you suckle wild animals, so you put them to your breast um or you you tear them to pieces with your bare hands. And this is a right of kind of um ecstatic dismemberment um called sporagmos in Greek. Uh and if you are a minad who is particularly off her face um then you might go one step further and eat um tear the the flesh off your victim and eat it raw um which again the Greeks called omafagia. And the excitement of it is that you are subverting every norm that governs conventional society in Greece. So you are abandoning um your city for the uplands, for the wilds. You're human, but you're turning into a wild beast. And if you're a woman, then you are casting off all the kind of the rules, the assumptions, the decorum that are supposedly govern your behavior. And in the back eye Uripides describes the minads turning men to flight. So men are playing the role of women. It's so subverting gender norms as critics would say now we love doing that and the rest is history. And this is what the bea is all about. But having said that it's not just minads who are doing it. Um you also get men who are called satires and the satire has um a hint of the goat like David Lloyd George. Yes. Yes. Well, like Lord George, it's this kind of the the exciting sense that you're casting off the norms and you can do whatever you like. And Minad's satires both are following the same god. And one of the names that this god has is Bakus for obvious reasons. He's the god of the baya. Um he's also known as the eater of raw flesh. He has a whole host of other names, but his his original name um the name by which the Greeks generally refer to him is Dionis. Right. So Dionis of all the Greek gods, Tom, I have to say I've always found him the most mysterious and obviously he's the most unsettling because of the rights that are associated with him. And we talked in previous episodes about how people generally encounter the Greek myths when they're children as children's stories. But Dian Isis doesn't really fit in them at all. When people think of the Olympians, he's not one of the names that first comes up. But as we'll see, as I know you're going to talk about, scholars have become more and more interested in Dian Isis. Yeah. In over the last century or so, and he's moved from the periphery really to sort of center stage in historians understandings of the Greeks and their and I was about to say their religion. I know you question the word religion and their experience of the of the the supernatural. Yes. Exactly. So yes. Yes. So, so Dianicis tends not to feature um in children's books and also he has always been a a challenge to um to those who have an idea of ancient Greece as um you know a world of of serenity and kind of harmony and light and rationalism and all of that. And this was um a stereotype of ancient Greece that was very popular particularly in Germany in the in the 18th and 19th centuries. So um enthusiasts for ancient Greece were always kind of mooning over the noble simplicity and quiet grandeur as one of them put it of of Greek civilization. But there was um a kind of reaction against that bubbling under in 19th century um Germany. And the the classicist who most famously reacts against it is the great philosopher Friedrich Ner. Mhm. Um who oddly ends up talking to a horse in a quite kind of dianis manner. But very early on in his career long before that he published a a book called the birth of tragedy. And he was only 28 when he did it. He was already a professor of of Greek. And essentially in that book he is doing for Dianisis what Freud would do for Edypus a couple of of decades later. Kind of make him into I guess you'd call him a meme now. Um something an expression of something that seems simultaneously very ancient but kind of thrillingly modern thrillingly 19th century. Um, and what nature is doing in the birth of tragedy is to contrast Dianisis with Apollo, who for the Greeks is the god of light, of beauty. And nature insists that you can't really understand Greek civilization if you just emphasize the light and the beauty. You also have to recognize the deeply Dionician qualities, right, that Greek civilization had as well. And you know I mean nature is more than familiar with the back eyee. The backy plays a key role in the birth of tragedy and he you know he in all this kind of tearing people to pieces and things. He says he recognizes the darkness. He said an effusive transgression of the sexual order whose waves swept away all family life and its venerable principles an abominable mixture of sensuality and cruelty. So he's saying that's a bad thing. Right? Not in favor of that. But then he is also saying that it has you know the brilliant sides to it. Essentially, it's fun or as he puts it, the blissful rapture which rises up from the innermost depths of men. I mean, that is German for fun, basically. Right. Yeah. I'm sure that he expressed that in one word. Yeah. I'm one huge German word. Yeah. The essence of the Dian nature says basically it's like it's it's like getting drunk. It's like getting pissed. It's intoxication. And Dianisis for the Greeks is the god who invents wine. So famously, Dianisis is the god of of getting drunk. But he's also the god who is there when humans experience the thrill of nature that has not been tamed by humans. So the thrill of the wild and also and I think very geranely and this is part of what nature found so fascinating about it and it's certainly what people have found fascinating about it in the 20th century. the sense of ecstasy that you get when you dissolve your your own individual sense of yourself into a crowd. A huge theme of 20th century writing and 20th century criticism, right? So I mean I know you're going to make a comparison with the 1960s. You know, having read loads of sort of countercultural stuff in the 1960s, people were always going on about this about the joy of Dianician rebels and that was what the 60s represented and you know that was the spirit and we were car you know sort of absolutely reveling in the idea of of sort of that there being something it is quite a kind of Freudian idea that there's something deep down buried that needs to be let out and by drinking or by taking drugs and and by forgetting your individuality and becoming one with your friends, you will express some deeper, more authentic truth. And that's a, as you say, massive thing in the 60s, but going into, you know, rave culture, I mean, a main ad is literally a raver. Yeah. And the idea of going off to, you know, a field in Hampshire and taking ease and whiz, this is, you know, you could dignify it by saying this is Dianis, but there is also kind of a much darker side to Dianis, the notion of the Dianis in the 20th century. So um there's a there was a seminal study of the back eye written by a guy splendid name of RP Winningington Ingram which came out in 1947. So after immediately after the second world war called Uripides and Dianisis Winningington Ingram had witnessed the Nuremberg rallies and in the introduction to his book he wrote we have lived through events which have demonstrated tragically the dangers of group emotion. He doesn't specify what it is but in 1947 everyone knows what he's referring to. And so you can see why the idea of the Dianis I mean it's a very powerful one because if it can embrace both you know the counterculture of the 60s and the Nuremberg rallies you know you're covering a lot lot of bases there and I think that although today classicists do not accept the kind of the precise details of of the technical arguments that nature goes into in the birth of tragedy. What they do accept is his broader case which is that Dianisis has a really central role in Greek civilization in Greek culture and and more generally the irrational right you know there's a famous book by Dods the Greeks and the irrational I mean even Apollo I mean Apollo Apollo is counterpointed to Dianisis by nature but Apollo is an absolute bastard as well I mean he you know he's killing everyone left right and center too so the sense of the the dark and the strange and the weird and the ecstatic is crucially a part of Greek mythology, but a Greek myth but not of the legends. Right? So, here's the thing. A lot of people when they saw we're doing a series about Greek myths would have been like, "Oh, they're going to do Heracles. They're going to do Perseus. Oh, Dianis. That's a slight niche one to choose." And is that because Dianosis, he doesn't really feature in a lot of the kind of canonical stories. Now, why is that? Why is he is he even mentioned in the Iliad at all? He there are very fleeting references to him by Homer by Heidi and he's not a central figure in any way as you say and that is crucially important because as we said we we've said already the Greek understanding of the gods is mediated by poets not by by priests or prophets. What about temples? Are the temples too? Not many not many temples either. Um and in fact as happens in the the plot of the backy seems much keener on kind of pulling temples down than having them erected to him. And I think a further reason why Dianis seems slightly at the margins of of the kind of conventional understanding of Greek myth is that he is conventionally portrayed as a very young god kind of very youthful um and he is also described as coming from um beyond Greece and particularly from the east. So in the back eye for instance Dianisis describes himself as arriving in thieves from Asia the fields of Lydia and Friia fertile in gold. Um and Willington Ingram in that book which published in 1947 he completely takes for granted that Dianisis is a very recent import that he's only just come to Greece and this is why he's not really mentioned by Homer or or or by Hishid but actually our understanding of of who Dianisis is has been completely transformed since the 1940s because in the 1950s tablets from the masonian citadels in Greece and from um from Cree were cracked and these kind of very ancient tablets and it revealed that actually Dianisis is one of the oldest Olympians and he has a temple on one of the islands in the Aian that has been dated as far back as the 15th century BC. So he is actually, you know, I mean, he's he he's been part of the Greek imagination for a very very long time. And although he's kind of hazy perhaps in the public imagining as a figure of myth, and although his cult does seem weird and strange when compared to the the cults of other gods, he is no less Greek than Apollo. And that's basically what, you know, what nature had had kind of intuited. And so his strangeness is not, you know, it's not a bug. It's an absolute feature. It's it's it's there at the heart of Greek culture right from the very beginning. Well, let's try to tell his story a little bit. So, obviously the fact that he's not covered by these great poets or he's not really covered in the same detail means that it's harder to piece together his to create a canonical story for him as we did for you know you you told the story of Zeus for example or you could do it with Hermes or Apollo or whoever. Now, there are lots of different rival traditions aren't there. So, one of them is that the Titans tore him apart and then they at him and then they put him back together, which strikes me as it's it's it's kind of drawing on the the rituals that he's associated with. And then the other is that he's the son of Zeus and Pesphanie, who's the queen of the underworld. Which one of those do you go for or do you go for neither? Okay, for all of them. Okay. Um and and bear in mind that that um Pesphanie was uh Zeus's daughter. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. By his sister. Um, so there's a there's a whole lo of incest going on there. There's a lot going on there. And there's also there were traditions that there were actually two gods called Dionis. So essentially, I think what you have is that the stories told of Dianisis are like, you know, haze of smoke. It's impossible to get a finger on them. They're always kind of drifting away. But having said that, in thieves there is a very distinctive tradition and it it derives from the one significance reference to Dianisis that we do get in Heidi. So we talked about him in in the first episode. He wrote a um a poem called the theogyny that discusses where the gods came from and to the extent that there is a kind of canonical account of the origins of the gods he provides it. And so what he has to say about Dianisis even though it's very fleeting has a lot of weight. So what he had said's daughter Semile boruse a respplendant son in shared intimacy. Mary Dionis, immortal son of mortal mother. And Cadmus, who we talked about in the previous episode, the Phoenician dragon's teeth. Sewing dragon's teeth. The Phoenician prince who had had gone to look for his sister Europa, never finds her, comes to to thieves and founds um thieves. He is the father of Agave, the mother of Penthus, who tears him to pieces. And that means that Penthus, the son of Agave, is the cousin of Dionis. So very much a family affair. Very much a family affair. And this is the story that Uripides who is in Athens you know just down the road from thieves is drawing on for the opening of the back eye. So the play opens with Dionis himself. He's standing on the stage and he announces to the watching audience who he is. I am Dianisis son of Zeus my mother was Sele Cadmas's daughter from her womb the fire of a lightning flash delivered me. And as so often in tragedy, we don't get the full story because the playwright is assuming that the audience already knows it. And the reason that Uripides can assume that people know this is because another famous playwright um called Escilus had actually written a celebrated play about exactly this drama. And so um as far as we can tell the story that is told in thieves and then recycled by the Athenian tragedians about the birth of of Dianisis in thieves goes as follows. So Z is a priestess of Zeus in thieves and she's very beautiful and so inevitably she attracts the attention of Zeus who transforms himself into an eagle and repeatedly descends on her and very rapidly gets her pregnant with Dionis. And it's evident from the beginning that Dianisis is something special because you only have to touch Z's pregnant belly and you are driven into a kind of ecstatic madness. Ha, the wife of Zeus, relentlessly jealous, um, understandably because of Zeus's record of philandering, she finds out about this and it's a slightly kind of Snow White in the Disney film vibe. She transforms herself into an old crone. And she visits Semile and she says, you know, you you you think that this this eagle coming every night is Zeus, but I mean, how do you know? Are you sure about this? And Se starts to worry about this and says, well, how can I find out? And here says, the only way that you can know it is Zeus is if you ask him to reveal himself in the full refulgent glory of his divine splendor. And Simil says, "Okay, well that's I I'll do that." And so she's she's in bed with Zeus. I don't know whether he's turned into a Yeah. Zeus or whether he's still an eagle. I mean, stroking his feathers or whatever. And she says, "Darling, um, we, you know, promise me something." And Zeus says, "I promise you whatever." And somebody says, "Absolutely swear it solemnly. You cannot break it." And Zeus says, "Fine." And then somebody says, "I want you, if you are Zeus, to show me your full glory." And Zeus desperately tries to back out of it, you know, tries to say, "Please don't make me do this." But Semile insists. And so Zeus has no choice. And he reveals himself this kind of scorching blaze. It's like looking into the heart of um, I don't know, an atom bomb going off or something. It completely shrivels and destroys Semile and she's left as kind of charred, smoldering ash. And Zeus picks up the unborn baby who's been left undamaged by this manifestation. and he sews um the fetus into his uh thigh and then a few weeks later Dionis is born. So a very a very improbable implausible story your father would probably describe it to us. He would but this is this is what the the thieans absolutely thought had happened. This is this is the the the story that is being invoked at the start of Uripides play because Dianisis describes in it how his mother's house smolders with the still living flame of Zeus's fire. And Dionis notes approvingly that Cadmas who is still alive. So the very by this point aged founder of thieves has consecrated the house of Semile as as as holy as sacred to the gods and Dianisis himself boasts of having decked it round with sprays of young vine leaves. So the vine of course is is is holy to Dianisis. Yeah. So that's thieves. But there are Athenian traditions as well, aren't there? the kind of rival traditions because the Athenians say okay fine you know um he was born in thieves but he came to Athens and they have a festival celebrates it don't they anestisteria which is held in the spring it is and it's it's um as is uh the way with Dianisis it's simultaneously ecstatically joyous and deeply deeply unsettling so the fun side first essentially the anthisteria is a kind of great communal celebration and all of Dianisis's festivals are communal It's all about the ecstasy of of becoming part of a huge crowd and it marks the the opening and the drinking of the previous year's vintage and everybody in Athens shares in this. So slaves share in it and women who normally are discouraged from drinking wine, they also are they they can have a tipple and it's great fun. There's a huge huge procession. Um, Dianisis is ex escorted into Athens from Pereus the port and a cart and this cart has been made up to look like a ship. As the cart is led into Athens, it's surrounded by huge fallacies and the whole celebration is inspired by a famous poem um that describes Dianisis's victory over pirates. The the pirates are taking Dianisis's passenger. They try to to kidnap him and murder him. And Dianisis turns into a lion. And as he does so, uh, vines start to grow out from the mast and to wrap, um, wrap the tendrils wrap around, um, the rigging and then the oes and everything and all the pirates are turned into dolphins. Just on the festival, um, this is a very boring and bold question, sorry, but you said Dianisis is escorted into the city in a cart decorated sort of like a ship. When you say Dianisis, you mean a statue? Is it a stat an effigy of someone playing the part? We will come to exactly who Dianisis is in this celebration in a minute. I mean, you're absolutely right to fix on that because the thing that is representing Dianisis is incredibly interesting and then ties into the second festival that we'll be talking about. Exciting, tantilizing. But so, so but just sticking to the anthia at the moment. This idea of a great festival of Dianis arriving in a city is clearly something that Uripides is echoing in the back eye. And the other thing that he is echoing in the back eye is the absolutely central role in this festival that is played by women. So there is a band of women who are called the venerable ones. So presumably they're kind of more elderly. They are appointed to make a nighttime sacrifice to Dionis in one of the the few temples that have been erected to him. But it's telling that this temple is not in the city. It's out in the marshes, right? And it is only ever opened during this festival. And they all go out there and one of them who has been appointed queen of the venerable ones then we are told has sex with Dian Isis. And what exactly that means I mean we will never know. We have no idea what that actually means. But there are illustrations on vasees um made in Athens that shows the the venerable ones um at this this shrine out in the marshes and they're drinking and they're dancing and they're making sacrifice before the idol of Dianisis. And this idol, Dominic, this is what you were asking about. It's a very it's very primitive. It's not the kind of um you know the glowing sculpture that you would get in the museum today. It's not what you kind of imagine as a Greek statue. It's essentially a pole with a mask hanging from it. Uh how would you have carnal relations with a mask? Well, it's a mask hanging from a pole. So, who knows what's on the pole? Yeah, the pole. But I mean the mask what parts of that anyway. Anyway, I mean it overthinking this element. You're not overthinking it because it is an intriguing question and and you know if you've got a festival with huge fallacies I mean we don't know. Yeah. And and I think lots of Greeks didn't know. I mean that was part of the fascination of what were these women getting up to in their temple? I mean and and so you can see that it would as with us kind of inspire all kinds of male fantasies and questions. Yeah. that that is then part of the context for what for what Uripides is doing. And that mask from the evidence of of Athenian pottery, which is really the only evidence that we have, does seem from very ancient times to have been specifically associated with Dionis. And the mask plays a key role in the other great festival that is celebrated in Athens. Um, and in this festival, the huge mass of the of the of the city's male citizens assemble in a theater on the slopes below the the Acropolis to watch the staging of myths by actors who are wearing masks. And this is a festival called the great Dionicia and it was staged in late spring. And unlike the the anthisteria, it's of relatively recent origin. So the late 6th century BC anthia origins reach back centuries and centuries. This festival is inaugurated while Athens is still under the rule of tyrants. But the tyrants get expelled. The democracy is founded. And this festival and particularly the um the acting out of of stories by people wearing masks becomes a a key part of the culture of of democratic Athens. It has at its heart this amazing cultural innovation that the Athenians call drama. Right. So that obviously includes tragedy but it also includes comedy and it includes things called satire plays and these are plays that have satires. So the male followers of Dionis as as as a chorus that's his own genre. The satire his own genre. Have any of them survived? Yeah kind of we have fragments of it. Um Tony Harris Tony Harrison kind of wrote one to give you people a sense of what it might have been like. Right. Was it good? Yeah it is good. Yeah. I mean, if you like a satire play. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I mean, I mean, I don't know anything about satire plays, so I don't know if I should give it a go. Open-minded. Yeah, I'm very openminded. You know me. So, you've got your satire plays, they're clearly dianis, but actually the the tragedies and comedies, even though they don't always I mean, most of the surviving ones don't have Dianisis at its center. Nevertheless, it's clear, I think, that the whole festival is very, very Dianis. So to quote Richard Seafford who who wrote a excellent book on on Dianisis, the drama festival was performed in a sanctuary of Dianisis along with rituals for Dianisis during a festival of Dionis and on top of that Dionis is viewed as one of the key sources for poetic inspiration. I think we can conclude from that that Dianisis definitely had a part to play in drama. He absolutely does and also think about the communal nature of it. um that you know the audience huge huge numbers of people gathering. Do women attend? We're never told that they don't, but probably not. There's probably not room for them. I mean, maybe a priestess or two there, but probably this is a a you know, it's the mass of the the male citizens who are there and they're sitting down to watch stories that may not feature Dianisis himself, but these stories tend to have themes that echo stories that are told about Dionis. though royal dynasties tearing themselves to pieces. So you get that in Edypus for instance. Yeah. Um dramatic moments of revelation, dramatic moments where fortunes are upended and reversed and the downfall of someone who thinks to defy the gods um while a chorus watches on. So all of that you get in Edypus. But what you get in the back eye is Dionis himself. So he is there nakedly. You know for the Greeks it's the equivalent of drinking wine unmixed with water. Yeah. If you think about a conventional tragedy, Dionis isn't present. That's the watered down wine. If you have Dianisis at the center of the tragedy, that is like drinking neat wine. And the Greeks tended not to do that because they knew that it was incredibly dangerous. Oh, it's exciting. So, we've got to the neat wine. It is powerful. It's intoxicating. It's dangerous. And that is the back eye. And we're going to be asking the second half, why and when was it staged? uh when it was what did people think of it? What on earth was the point of it? What did people think of it when they first saw it? And how does it point towards a excitingly radical interpretation of myth? Tom, I'm just reading from your notes here. You're doing it brilliantly. Yeah. One that continues to influence how we tend to conceptualize the world to this day. I don't think we've ever had a more exciting cliffhanger. So, so come back in a minute. Dominic, can I just say I mean you could give it more well because it really is exciting. What is happening in Athens at this point and the Bakai is channeling it is something that is going to profoundly affect the way that the Greeks understand the world but also continues to influence the way that we understand the world to this day. So after the break, probably the most important half hour of your lives, like a half hour of Tom Holland chat that will change the way you see the world, you see the Greeks, that you understand the meaning of your own life and your purpose on this earth. Come back after the ads, or if you're member of the rest of history club, plunge in right away to this intoxicating bath of undiluted wine and blood. This episode is brought to you by Uber. Now, do you know that feeling when someone shows up for you when you need it most? We all need that sometimes, and Uber knows it. Uber isn't just a ride or a meal delivered. It's showing up no matter what. Like for your long-distance friends, bringing soup when they're sick, sending flowers when they're down, when it really matters. Whatever it is, you show up. Where there's a will, we're on our way. Uber on our way. Download the app today. Welcome back to the rest is history. I can only imagine the excitement and the tension as people look forward to this, the most thrilling 25 minutes of content, we will ever produce. uh 25 minutes that will probably change all our lives because Tom really wanted to give this some because he thinks it's so important. It's the back eye. It's Uripides's play. It was first staged in 405 BC and even then did people know how important this would be all these years later um for listeners to the rest is history. I don't know maybe they did. No, I don't think that was uppermost in their minds. No, because in 405 BC they're thinking about other things. They absolutely are thinking about other things. So it is aostumously produced play. Uripides had died the previous year according to tradition in Macedon and one year later so in the spring of 404 BC Athens is going to surrender to Sparta. So we talked in the previous episode there's been this great war that's been raging since 431 BC. Athens is on the brink of defeat and when the defeat comes it is absolutely total. So everybody who is taking a seat to watch the back eye when it is premiered knows what they're staring down the barrel of. They're staring down the barrel not just of defeat but of potential, you know, annihilation. Their city could be flattened to the ground by the Spartans. And so I think that that raises two obvious questions. And the first is what exactly were they watching that spring morning of 405 BC? And then secondly, how did it impact them? Bearing in mind what the the the horrible political context was. Okay, let's start with the plot. So what are they watching? What's the story? So we've described how Dianisis arrives and and tells the audience who he is. He has come from across the sea, but his own family have rejected him. And part of the reason for that is that although he has revealed himself as divine to the audience, he hasn't done so to um other people in thieves. he's kind of in disguise. Um but and and already the punishment that he's visiting on his family for refusing to acknowledge him is is kicking in. So we're told that um Dianisis's aunt, so that's Agave, Ano, um Oono, have been driven mad. They've gone out um onto the uplands. They've put on their kind of you know their their dainty forn outfits um and they are roaming the mountains. Penthus is he's he's an absolute square. He's not into this. He doesn't find it groovy at all. Um and he is shocked in all kinds of ways. So women running free. That's bad. Um his grandfather Cadmas uh and Teracius, you remember our old friend from stint as as a woman. Yes. And then become a man, but now he's he's got back into dressing up as a woman because he and Cadmas have both dressed up as minads. They're very elderly. Um, you know, they they they look ridiculous. So, again, um, Penth is not approving of that. And the the claims of Dianis's followers that he's a god, he Penthis also thinks this is utterly blasphemous and shocking. And so, he orders that Dianisis should be captured, brought into his presence, and then stoned into death. And he also orders that um a a squad of uh of of a crack squad of elite picked men should go up into the mountains and capture the main ads and stop them getting up to their shenanigans. However, obviously it it it doesn't work out. Dianisis is captured, but it doesn't take him long to reveal to Penthus, to the to the audience his terrifying divine power. So Penthus thinks that Dionis is being tied up, but in fact, it's a bull that's being tied up. Penthus can no longer distinguish between this bull in the stable and Dianisis. Dianisis then makes Penthus' palace shake, collapse, and then the rubble of the palace is consumed by a great blaze of fire. And Penthus emerges back onto the stage completely by bewildered by this stabbing at the air. You know, he's he's starting to lose it. At this point, a herdsman arrives. Um, he's come down from the heights of Mount Keithon and he reports what he's seen there. And basically, he's seen the Minads and they are picking up snakes, twining them into their hair. They are putting um, Penthus' elite squad of crackpicked men um, to flight. And the women are doing this armed only with starves tipped with pine cones. So very again kind of very, very unsettling. And they are going around and every time they find a cow or a bull, they tear it to pieces. And so the herdsman reports, "You'd see some ribs or a cleft hoof tossed high and low and rags of flesh hung from pine branches dripping blood." Now, by this point, it's as though you know the ease and whis are kicking in for Penthus. He's getting increasingly spaced out. Um, and he essentially is putty now in Dianis's hands. He does whatever Dianisis tells him to do. And Dianisis persuades Pentheus that what he should really do is go up into the heights and spy on the main ads and that the best thing the best way to do that would be for Penthus to dress up as a woman to dress up as a minad. I feel like nothing good is going to well I know that nothing good is going to happen to Pentheus. He's making some bad choices. He is making some but but you know then again he's kind of off his face and so Penthus says yeah that's a brilliant idea and by now he's really tripping. So he says, "I seem to see two sons are double thieves." Um he looks at Dianisis and he sees a pair of horns sprouting from from his head and he is starting to recognize the god for what he is. So he um he he puts on his you know his thorn thornskin dress um and then Dianisis leads him off stage and they're going up to the mountain and it doesn't take long for a messenger to appear on the stage and to report what happened next. And we're told that Penthus had reached the heights of Mount Ktheron. Um, and he wants a good view of the Maynads who are, you know, rampaging around, having their rave, all of that. And so, Dionis pulls down a pine tree and he puts Penthus on the top of the pine tree and then he twang, you know, he lets the pine snap back up so that Penthus is then at the top of the tree looking down at the Maynads. And then Dianisis, the roter, yells over to the Maynads and says, "Hey, look at this. There's a spy pointing up at the hapless Pentheus who's on the top of the tree and the mayaz go absolutely mad and they start shaking the tree and then the the herdsman says from from his high perch plunging crashing to the earth Pinthus fell with one incessant scream as he understood what end was near and that passage that you read at the beginning of this show uh that is what happens he is torn to pieces and shortly afterwards on stage agave appears and she is cradling her son's head and effectively you know what the actor must have been holding is the mask of of Penthus and presumably Agave is played by the same actor who'd been playing Penthus. So Agave thinks that what she's holding is the head of a lion. She thinks that's what she's torn to pieces and it's only gradually in obedience to the prompings of Cadmas her father that she kind of comes out of her ecstatic state and realizes what it is she's holding and what it is that she's done. She's devastated. She and her sisters are sent into exile and Cadmas and his wife are turned into snakes. So a bad a bad day for the royal family of thieves. And the moral of the story is summed up by Casmus at the very end of the play. If any man derides the unseen world, let him ponder the death of Penthus and believe in the gods. So a blood soaked dumo, an absolutely devastating play. Um, and the obvious question is what what does it mean? What's the point? Because is the, you know, are we to see Penthus as the the the villain as it were, who's being punished for not embracing the spirit of Dianisis, or are we, you know, is Penthus the a martyr, a victim, and should we feel sorry for him? And is Dianisis actually a terrible person or terrible god? Yeah. And I guess that's the point about the Greek myths, isn't it? that they that that it's impossible to fix a simplistic meaning on something that seems so slippery and so nuanced but also so frankly so strange and so terrifying. Absolutely. There are there there are critics who see Pentheus as the villain see him as as as or Dianisis as the villain. You can stage it I mean you could stage it as being about the coming of the Nazis. You could cast Dian Isis as you know as Hitler or you could stage it with um you know Penthus as some boring square who is refusing to drop out and join the hippies. Yeah. And as you say that is a kind of the measure of the richness of this of of Greek myth and of tragedy is that 2 and a half thousand years on it's it still has this kind of richness. It can be interpreted and adapted. But I'm guessing that that's a very modern way of viewing it, right? that the Athenians when they saw it as part of a communal experience that is a central part of their city's calendar and you know how important their civic culture is to them they would not have said oh this has multiple meanings and it's very slippery and nuanced they would have said it has one meaning and the meaning is this so what is it well I I think the context is key the fact that they are staring down the barrel of total ruin and they're sitting there watching the dramatic portrayal of a city being utterly destroyed um So, Uripides is very precise about this in the back eye that the ruin that's visited on Penthus is also a ruin that is visited on thieves. So, to quote Uripides, the city's streets tremble in guilt as every Thean repents too late his blindness and his blasphemy. And I think it's impossible to believe that Athenians wouldn't have felt those lines as incredibly chilling and thought about how how the ruin that's going to be visited on thieves is is going to, you know, might well be the ruin that's visited on them, right? Yeah. And and what's more, it's the men who are sitting there thinking about it and they're watching Penthus, the king, who has responsibility for the the day-to-day affairs of of his city. In a democracy, it's the mass of the male citizens who have that responsibility. So, they're watching Penthus lead thieves to disaster. And they must have been reflecting, well, you know, Pentheus is us. We we we the citizen body who have responsibility for the day-to-day running of this city. Um whether it goes to war, how we conduct that war, we likewise have led our city to ruin. I mean, I think it must have been devastating. But their mistakes, if they are mistakes, have been political, military, diplomatic ones. Penthus' mistake is that he doesn't fully embrace what you would call Tom to to do a Tom Hollandism, the dimension of the supernatural, right? Um, is Uripides arguing that that is also the Athenian's mistake? That is he is he a sort of is there a slightly savorola aspect savor Florence aspect to this? basically you haven't this is an opportunity for you to revive your grally voice Tom seven's voice um uh is see but is Europe saying the the the mistakes you know the political mistakes are merely a symptom of a deeper kind of moral spiritual malaise well as in the backy so in the dying days of the great war with Sparta the Athenians would take for granted that the gods are actors in the drama of of what of what is happening and normally for the Athenians the readiness of the gods to intervene in the affairs of their city is seen as as a positive. So to quote Greg Anderson um who I've already cited in this series in his book the realness of things past for the Athenians the gods of Attica were not some group of faceless superhuman hired contractors they were something closer to benevolent governors or caring parents beings who perpetually monitored and managed the shared local environment taking a personal interest in the life and well-being of their chosen people and the chosen people is the demos that is what the democracy is. the rule of the the chosen people of Atica, the chosen people of Athena. And this notion of the Athenians as a chosen people of of Athena and of other gods as well, worshiped by the Athenians. Um, this embraces women as well as men. And in fact, it is women far more than men who are entrusted with the rituals that exist to please the gods and thereby to keep the deos secure. So that's, you know, why these women are going off to the temple of Dianisis in the swamp. um you know they're the ones who preside over the sacred rituals but there are other rituals as well. So from childhood they've been doing it. So at the age of 10 we're told the girls of of Athens go out to a shrine of Artemis the the goddess of the hunt um on the shores of Atica and there they turn into bears and they run with with with Artemis or they tend the sacred snake on the Acropolis or they weave robes for Athena which are carried up onto the Acropolis and are used to adorn her statues. And Uripides himself is in, you know, he he is fully conscious of this role that women are mandated to play in securing the health of the Demos and of Athens because we have a fragment um from an otherwise lost play in which he states this explicitly. So to quote this fragment as regards relations with the gods, matters which I judge to be more important than anything, it is we women who have the leading role to play. So he's ventriloquizing woman in this fragment. For there are many rights which cannot legitimately be performed by men, but which flourish when women conduct them. The order which prevails in the engagements of mortals with the gods is then it can be said a female one. And so that being so again, imagine how terrifying it must have been to sit there knowing that your city is on the brink of total ruin watching women running a mock worshiping Dionis in a way that causes ruin for the state. In the back eye, women are embroiled in the collapse of thieves just as much as men are. And I I again I think that the relevance of this for the first audience of the back eyee would have been stupifying. They must have thought that I mean what's the lesson of the back eye that men can adopt policies that are disastrous but also that women who are mandated to keep the gods on side can run completely a mock and be complicit in the destruction of the city as well. So I think that that is a theme that must have been overwhelming for the audience. This sense that men and women alike are embroiled in the disaster that the Athenians like the theans are facing. And what is the argument that Uripides is making then? What is the argument that he's you know how is he how does this story illustrate the deeper failings? you know, is it that they've that they haven't honored the gods, that they've lived in um in an ungodly way, that they have? Yes, I think I think that's absolutely I I I think Uripides is saying that well, I mean, it's a drama. He's not saying it, but it's but but it's a possibility that is haunting the the contours of the drama. He's saying that that men like Pentheus in the day-to-day running, they can they can disrespect the gods. they can lead their city into disastrous policies, but also that it's possible for women who are mandated to honor the gods and to keep the gods on side. Um that they can also fail in that responsibility and that if men and women both fail then the consequences for a city is disastrous. Now that of course is to assume that the gods are real. Yeah. Um and there is another possibility one that is not countenanced in the back eye where the god you know Dianisis is on the stage the last messages believe in the gods but Uripides was notorious for having explored the possibility that the gods did not exist in other plays. Um so we again another fragment that hasn't survived in in total from a play called Boleran. Berafan was a hero who fights the Chimera, fights the Chimera and and rides around on Pegasus, the magical flying horse. And in it, um, Boleran describes murderous leaders. Um, so, you know, leaders of cities that come to disaster. And he says, uh, he he describes these murderous leaders, people who der who who deprive citizens of their property and break their oaths to sack cities, and despite this, they prosper more than those who live piously in peace every day. I know two of small cities that rever the gods which are subject to larger more impious ones overcome as they are by a more numerous army. So that's has a real resonance in the you know the terrible war between Athens and Sparta. All these kind of things have happened and in it Boleran argues therefore there can be no gods because if there were gods then they wouldn't commit crimes like this. Exactly. And of course I suppose you could say Boleron's just a character. Uripides doesn't believe this himself, but for Uripides to imagine a character who thinks like that suggests that there must be people who think like that. He's not, you know, he's not going to imagine the unimaginable. So, Uripides is countenancing the possibility at least that there is an argument to be had about whether the gods are real. Yeah. Well, we don't know what Uripides himself thought. And it's worth I mean emphasizing that Boleran does have a magical flying horse and he and and in the play he uses he he flies on Pegasus up to Mount Olympus to see whether the gods are real or not and uh is is thrown they are because he gets Yes. So they are so in the play his doubt is answered um in a in a kind of tragic way but it is a staple of the comedies which are being staged in the dianister as well as the tragedies. Uripides appears in in comedies by Aristophanes, the most famous of all the the great Athenian comic writers. And for for Aristophanes, it's an a kind of standing joke that um that Uripides is an atheist. Um to quote Aristophanes, he's always persuading men that there aren't any gods. And for Aristophanes, Uripides is the spokesman for a kind of a real a sinister elitist trend. um and metropolitan atheist, metropolitan liberal trend, right? And and this trend essentially is to believe that um that that uh that the stories that are told by Homer and by Heidi and by the other ancient poets are inadequate to explain and characterize the true character of the divine. And this is a trend that is more than a century old by the time that Uripides is writing the Bachi. And it originates on the opposite side of the Aian to uh to Athens. So in in what's now Turkey, Anatolia um in the mid 6th century BC and in time so just a few decades after the death of Uripides this kind of um intellectual trend will come to be called philosophia the love of wisdom so philosophy which is is probably the most well I mean not probably I mean it is the most radical and influential of all the intellectual achievements of ancient Greece and It it kind it it originates as a reaction against the stories that were told by the poets very specifically and you so it's kind of manifest itself in all kinds of ways. So it's critique of the kind of homeriic anthropomorphic gods the gods who look like humans it's completely devastating. So there's a guy called Xenophanes who writes, "If cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create work such as men do, horses like horses and cattle like cattle also would depict the god's shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have." You know, we only we only think that their gods look human because we're human. If we were horses, we'd think they look like horses. And Z of goes on to say that black people um worship black gods and that red-head people worship red-head gods. Are the redhead gods? So, I'm not I'm not aware of any redhead gods. The Thrians, Dominic. Apparently, the Thrians had red hair and they worship red-head gods. Okay, there you go. I stand corrected. Other philosophers um insist that Zeus doesn't hurl thunderbolts. Um that the sun isn't a fiery chariot, right? That the universe instead is formed out of air or moisture or fire, out of kind of universal eternal substances. And the very word mythos which in Homer signifies a story that is infused with authority with truth that actually it means the opposite that a mythos a myth is a fable a a fantasy and the philosophers oppose this to another word logos which means reasoned argument. So you have you have myth fantasy and you have logos reasoned argument. So, in a sense, this answers the question I asked in the very first episode of the series, which is, did the Greeks genuinely believe this? Did they believe there were people with heads with the head of a bull or people on flying horses and all of this kind of stuff? And the answer is clearly no. A lot of the a lot of Greeks, some Greeks, not a lot, maybe some how many did not. And said, come on, this is rubbish. This is a it's interesting. They are that philosophy is born in opposition to story. Right. That's basically your what you're suggesting. It it absolutely is. And the most famous philosopher of all who was um you know a young man in his 20s when the back eyee was staged and then when when Athens fell the following year. He goes so far as to argue that in an ideal state the poets Homer Head and so on should be banned. And that man of course is Plato. And Plato in in The Republic, his attempt to um describe the the ideal form that a city should take, wrote, "Poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up. She lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled if mankind is ever to become happier and better." And so therefore, he says, you know, he shouldn't be allowed in. All this stuff about Kronos cutting off the testicles. I mean, it's just unacceptable. Um it's kind, you know, contravenes all kinds of health and safety regulations. Well, I don't think that's the prime objective, but I mean, he he essentially what he says is that this is an invitation to insurrection. Yeah. You know, I mean, before you know it, all kinds of people would be having their testicles cut off and we can't have that. And he also thinks that um uh here are seducing Zeus and you know, all this. It's just blasphemous and he doesn't want any of it. So, he still he still very much believes I mean, if he thinks it's blasphemous, he believes there is a supernatural element that needs to be treated with respect, but he thinks these are basically silly children's stories. He does that that introduce the gods and actually demean them. Yes. And so therefore Homer should be banned. Right. And so you know you said lots of people believe this. So the question then is does does this mean the end for the myths if with the emergence of philosophy with um Plato and so on. Is myth going to die? And it it doesn't and for two reasons. And the first of these is that the stories that are told of the gods, of the heroes and so on are so intimately interwoven into the fabric of Greek life. You know, all the cults, the festivals and so on, but also just the the mental headsp space. I mean, these stories are so powerful. They're so strong. They can't just be banished. And the Sandbrook perspective on this surely would be most people don't think about this at They're doing killing their fields. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. They're not intellectuals. They're not worrying about philosophy or whatever. So, so myth remains part of, you know, it's just the kind of the air that they're breathing in. Exactly. That would make total sense. They don't actually, if you said to somebody, are you interested in the stories of Zeus and Kronos or whatever? They'd say, "Sure, everyone knows these stories. Do you believe them?" They'd say, "I don't really think about them that much to be honest with you. I mean, we we observe the rituals, of course, but I've got better things to think about." So if we look at Plato, he sets up this this school outside Athens called the academy and it's so influential that in the long run, you know, it gives us the word academic. But it's worth emphasizing it stands outside Athens. It's not in the city and it is named after the tomb of a hero, Academus. So you know the the presence of of of of myth is there right in the heart of Plato's school and it you know this the academy cannot remotely compare for kind of splendor and cost and prestige with the temples that continue to stand in Athens. No one is going to say oh the academy is more important than the pathon. Right. So, it's the equivalent of like, I don't know, a liberal arts college in upstate New York where they're coming up with all kinds of wacky theories and what not and they're living outside capitalism, but actually in New York City, no one cares and they're just, you know, kind of. Yes, I suppose. Kind of. But the other thing to emphasize is that philosophy doesn't banish myth. It just creates a new one. So Zenophanes even as he's saying um you know uh cows would would worship cows what he's really disputing is the fact that the gods look like humans he absolutely believes in a god I mean and it sounds very much you know it will sound familiar to to montheist today wrote there is one god greatest among gods and men similar to mortals neither in shape nor in thought and those who are arguing that um you know the co the cosmos is made of air or fire or moisture or whatever. The assumption is is that these elements are themselves divine. So in that sense, the whole cosmos is divine and Plato is himself the greatest of all myth makers. And what he does with momentous consequences for the way that we continue to think today is that he makes the real unreal and the unreal real. Because what he's arguing is that beyond the world as we perceive it, there is another world which is um perfect, immortal, unchangeable. And the way that this is always summed up is that there are, you know, you have tables, all kinds of tables, but these are merely reflections of the perfect table that kind of exists as in an ideal state. So what Plato is doing, he's banishing the homeic gods, but he's enshrining new gods. And these are kind of essentially abstract nouns, you know, kind of the just, the beautiful, the good, whatever. And rather than a pa, so going out and celebrating on the mountain, what Plato is offering his followers is um an ascent. The idea that the individual has an ideal form, namely, you know, in the form of a soul or whatever you want to call it, and that this the soul can ascend from the dimension of the material to, as Plato puts it, the best of everything which can be comprehended by thought and which is eternal. And this in effect is God. And this concept is is is going to be a massive influence on Christianity on Islam on Islam. Um and so to quote Vultter Burkart in in his great book on Greek religion since Plato there has been no theology which has not stood in his shadow. So there's a sense in which the Greek reaction against myth that Plato exemplifies but you also have Aristotle and and and other philosophers too. This is this is part of the great river which will feed into the emergence of Christianity and and and and Islam and therefore is of titanic significance I think. So now with Plato and with his ideas we are heading towards we're not quite there yet but we're heading towards the Hellenistic era the age associated with Alexander the Great and his successes. And I guess the obvious question is after Plato and after the you know the the massive political disruption of the emergence of Macedon and Alexander and his empire, what does this mean for Greek mythology and the Greek stories of the gods? And how does Alexander in particular? How does he come to it? Because he assumes such massive existential significance. How does he change the way that Greeks think about the relation between mortal and the immortal? And Tom, this takes us to one of my favorite Greek myths, which is the story of Jason and the Argonauts, the quest for the Golden Fleece. And this is what we'll be doing next time, isn't it? And the exciting thing is, so we actually have our own crew. We have our own Argonauts and they can listen to that episode right away. Is there any way that somebody who's not on the Argo right now could join the Argo? Do you know of any such way? They absolutely could. they could sign up to the Argo by going to the restis.com and joining the merry crew there and going to win the golden fleece. And if this if if you think this last half hour of this show was absolutely mind-blowing and life-changing, let me tell you that episode on Jason and the Argonauts will knock everything that's gone before and the rest is history into a cockt. So don't delay. Join the Argo, sign up at the rest is history and listen to it right away. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
