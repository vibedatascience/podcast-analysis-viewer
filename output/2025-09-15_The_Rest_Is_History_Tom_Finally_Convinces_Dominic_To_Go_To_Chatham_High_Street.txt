DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
Why is Chatham High-street both futuristic and riddled with the past? Why was it a magnet for historical figures such as King John, Charles II, Nelson and Charles Dickens, and the location for some of the most totemic moments in British history? Is it really a melting pot of every epoch - from the Roman invasion of Britain, to the Napoleonic Wars, and to the Second World War - and therefore the most historically significant high-street in the world?

Rochester and chat. There's Dickens. There's naval stuff. There might be a mention of Horatio Nelson. There's people wrestling on the floor of a chapel or something. It is probably the most exciting, the most action-packed, the most blood soaked, and in many ways the most moving episode that we've ever done on the rest is history. This is the long awaited episode on Chattam High Street. I am making the pitch that this is the most historic street in England. Truly the world. Tom, no. Nelson reputedly drank here. So that's great. So that definitely happened. Uh so I I imagine that there'll be a kind of a mood of cloistered peace maybe amid the the hurly burly of Chattam. Uh a reminder of the spirituality of the Middle Ages. and I think it'll be very moving for people. So, let's go and see what's going on. Um, that's what this is. So, a C-class destroyer. What What's What's your favorite kind of destroyer? What What class? Probably if you're an enthusiast for vape shops or possibly to two parlors. Uh, Chattam High Street now is very much the place to go. It's incredibly old. And also, I think also very nice is the the color. Gosh, that's well observed. That's the way I roll, Tom. That's the way I operate. If I can if I can win and suck all the pleasure out of it for other people, so much the better. I've learned that Chattam's not just a town. It's a community. And I think that's lovely. That he called Chattam Delborra. So maybe we could use that as the title. This episode is presented by Adobe Express, the quick and easy create anything app. What does that mean? Well, say you need to make a presentation or a video or a social media post or a flyer. To some, certainly to me, that sounds intimidating. But Tom, with Adobe Express's intuitive features like templates, generative AI, and realtime collaboration, it has never been easier. Adobe Express. Try it for free. Search Adobe Express in the App Store. register and chat. Okay. Rochester and Chattam are two distinct places but contiguous except the interval of a very small marsh or vacancy between Rochester and Chattam. There is little remarkable in Rochester except the ruins of a very old castle and an ancient but not extraordinary cathedral. But the river and its appendices are the most considerable of the kind in the world. This being the chief arsenal of the Royal Navy of Great Britain. The buildings here are indeed like the ships themselves, surprisingly large. And in their several kinds, they're beautiful. The warehouses, or rather streets of warehouses and storehouses for laying up the naval treasure, are the largest in dimension and the most in number that are anywhere to be seen in the wild. The rope walk for making cables and the forges for anchors and other iron work bear a proportion to the rest. As also the wet dock for keeping masts and yards of the greatest size where they lie sunk in the water to preserve them. The boatyard, the anchor yard, all like the whole monstrously great and extensive. They're not easily described. So that Tom was Daniel Defoe who was a Londoner in the first volume of his tour through the whole island of Great Britain published in 1724. It was a massive success with the exception of Robinson Crusoe. It was by far his best-selling book, but never before has it been read out on the top of Rochester Castle on a gray and slightly dreary day in howling wind uh to an audience of bored looking camera people. So very exciting scenes. Yeah, because this is the long awaited episode on Chattam High Street, but not just Chattam High Street, Intra Chatam, which is the stretch that leads us onto Rochester High Street. And we are on the 100 ft summit of the keep of Rochester Castle. So Daniel Defoe, just for people who don't know, Defoe was he wasn't just Britain's uh first novelist. He was Britain's one of Britain's greatest journalists, wasn't he? And he did this tour of the whole island of Great Britain. Uh and he published it just a couple of decades after the active union had created a United Kingdom out of England and Scotland. So this is a moment in British history like no other. It's a point in which Britain is poised on the brink of absolutely enormous political, economic, diplomatic change. Absolutely. And um Defoe essentially loved change. He loved the idea of progress. Um progress is very wigish, isn't it? Um and although Defoe ended up working essentially as a kind of spy for a for a Tory government, I think in his instincts he was he was all about the wigs. So as a young man he had fought for the Duke of Monmouth against his uncle, the Catholic King James II. And Monmouth's rebellion had gone disastrously badly. But Defo had managed to avoid being hanged, which is good news for fans of um uh Robertson Crusoe and uh 18th century travalogs around Britain. Um he he'd loved the Glorious Revolution when James II got kicked out and replaced by the Protestant William and Mary. and he'd been a big enthusiast for the acts of union between England and Scotland um and had actively worked to promote them actually. And as you can probably tell from that accent, which is um exactly how he spoke, his origins were in trade. He's a merkantile man, isn't he? So um he'd worked as a wine merchant. So that perhaps explains one that's one reason why he's so keen on the Royal Navy. The idea of commerce of Britannia ruling the waves and of course he loves a naval dockyard. He absolutely does. And just to say as well that um you know he he had sailed the seas. He'd been a wine merchant. Dominic, you love a a Portuguese wine depot in the 18th century. Don't you? And Defo was kind of always hanging out there. And so it's not surprising really that when he comes to Rochester, which he describes as having a castle and cathedral, he looks at it as being rather boring and old. And Chattam, which is where the royal dockyards are, he is all over that. He thinks it's incredible. He thinks it's absolutely wonderful and I think that that's why that passage describing Rochester and Chattam is absolutely brilliant for pinpointing this idea of Britain as being on the kind of cusp of incredible change. Yeah. So there's a world of kind of um warehouses and and and dockyards and battleships and global trade and and free trade and all that kind of stuff. And this is the sort of this is the the central axis. This is the hub of that of that world, isn't it? Rochester and Chattam, these kind of twin towns across the Medway. So Tom, give us a little bit of a tour Doris. So the reason that we are here is obviously because I've bullied you into doing it. You've put up a heroic three-year rear guard action, but at last we are here in Rochester in chatter. You know what, ladies and gentlemen, when I look at Tom's notes and now that I'm here on site, I could not be more excited. I'm absolutely a go with excitement because there are so many delights to come in this episode. There's Dickens, there's naval stuff, there might be a mention of Horatio Nelson. There's people wrestling on the floor of a chapel or something. It is probably the most exciting, the most action-packed, the most blood soaked, and in many ways the most moving episode that we've ever done on the rest is history. The reason that I wanted to do it is that I've been walking the Saxon Shaw way, which is a kind of national route that follows the coastline of Kent, which for those people not familiar with the geography of England is the bit in the southeast that sticks out into the sea. Um, and I I realized coming here that Rochester High Street becomes Chattam High Street. And I felt that the the way in which you go from kind of um well we've got an iron age hill for we've got a a Roman bridge, we've got an Anglo-Saxon cathedral, we've got a Norman castle, and yet you end up with Chattam Docks, this kind of great nerve center of British imperial expansion. I I am making the pitch that this is the most historic street in England, surely the world, Tom. No. Well, I I think in Britain you can make a case for the Royal Mile in Edinburgh which has rude and um Edinburgh Castle and the grave of Adam Smith and all kinds of things like that. But this work, if you want a sense of the sweep and span and process of change that manifests itself through English history, Rochester High Street, Chattam High Street, if you think of it as a single road, I mean is is absolutely fantastic. Uh and you as Defo says Rochester is all about the kind of traditional England of tourist brochers. Yeah. Chattam is about energy and industry and transformation. And you could say, I think that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it's a kind of cross between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley. And Chattam right now, I mean, it's it's retained that reputation, has it? Hasn't it Tom? the glittering cosmopolitan. Um, it's on the very cusp of it's on the front line of technological and social change. No, I I I fear not. So, the the the Chattam dockyards shut in um 1984. And I think it would be fair to say that um if you're an enthusiast for vape shops or possibly to two parlors, uh Chattam High Street now is very much the place to go. I actually love both of those things, so it's great. it's probably not at the cutting edge of of naval technology now in the way that it used to be. So I think it's fair to say that Chattam has seen um happier days and and in that again of course it's an exemplar of British history because um obviously Britain is not the great power that it was in the 18th and 19th centuries and so if Chattam exemplifies the rise to global greatness of Britain there's also a sense in which its current state uh tells you about Britain's relative decline. But before we do um some history, why don't we have a little excursion into geography? We don't do enough geography on the rest of history and Theo in particular is a passionate afficionado of geography. So Tom, talk to Theo and and indeed the listeners about geography. Yeah. Well, geography of course so important to the study of history because so often geography is historical destiny and that is definitely the case with um Rochester and Chattam. So just to to set the geographical scene for people who may not be of uh with North Kent. So um we are just south of the Temp's Eststerie which is the kind of the um uh the the stretch of water that um extends from London outwards into the North Sea. So we've got Essex to the north and we in Kent on the south south coast of the the the uh the temp's eststerie and and we are standing beside the Medway which is a river that rises in Kent and flows northwards out into the temp's eststerie and Rochester and Chattam both stand on the Medway and would not have come into existence without the Medway. So to talk about Rochester first, why why is Rochester where it is? um basically because it is the lowest bridging point on the uh on the river Medway. So essentially if you want to get across the Medway, Rochester is the place to come. And in that it's relationship to the Medway is equivalent to to London's relationship to the temps. Um and as with London, um it's the Romans who build London Bridge. So here it's the Romans who build the first bridge over the Medway. But even before the Romans come, there is a trackway here that leads from, you know, do the the southeastern tip of Kent um up towards the rivers. And this is the um this is the the the foring point. So kind of very much kind of Iron Age highway. Um and this is the highway that in due course will will come to be called Watling Street, one of the great roads of of England. And so where is that Tom? Is that right here? Yeah. So so so that bridge that you can see there if you're watching this on YouTube. Um and essentially Chattam High Street, Rochester High Street, that's all part of Watling Street. So essentially when the Romans under Julius Caesar land here in 55 and then 54 BC uh in 54 BC Caesar advances towards the tempames he would almost certainly have come this way and and and again we can be pretty confident that in AD43 when Claudius sends um three legions here under Alice Plus um again they would have come here and in fact we know that there is a great two-day battle on the Medway perhaps here more likely a a little bit further mouth and um Vespasian who will go on to become the emperor. He crosses the river with his Bavian cavalry who have this extraordinary ability to swim in full armor. So very exciting scenes. It's unbelievably exciting and I cannot describe it's such a shame that the listeners and even the people watching on YouTube can't actually be here to because the air is electric with excitement, isn't it? To be here in this spot where it actually happened. Unbelievable history. Well, can I just crank up the excitement by revealing the name that the Romans give to the town that they build here? It's um Dura Bivi, which means almost certainly stronghold by the bridge. I mean, couldn't be more exciting. And both Watling Street and this bridge built by the Romans survive the Roman occupation, don't they? Basically, because they're just so well located. So if you're going to Dover, um if you are coming from Dover, if you're going to London, you're going to go this way. Yes. So it's absolutely the kind it's it's essentially it's the great road that links London and everything that lies beyond London to do and therefore to the continent. But enough of Rochester? There's been a lot of Rochester so far. Where's Chattam? Talk to me about Chattum. Well, the view of Chattam is on the other side of the keep where we're standing now. I'm looking at now. It's gorgeous. It's absolutely stunning. I think Dominic, we should uh get Harry to move the cameras and go over on the other side of the keep. So, as you can see, if you are watching on Spotify or on YouTube, we have now moved to the other side of the castle and the sense of drama, tension, and jeopardy is becoming more acute with every moment for two reasons. Number one, the wind has now reached gale force levels. And secondly, the staff of the castle are having to fight off a huge throng downstairs. Two different groups. One, a group of Rest is history club members who've just signed up at the restitis.com and have heard that Tom Holland is here. They're very excited. And the other, a group of school children whom Tom has forbidden from coming to the top of the castle, ruining their outing, their day, and quite possibly their love of history forever. But Tom, tell tell us tell everybody watching on Spotify and YouTube why you have barred these children from coming to the top of the castle so that you can talk about Chattum. Well, I I'll try to do it over the sound of the sobbing of distraught 12-year-old history fans. Um, but it's important for us to be on the summit of this 100 ft Norman Keep because uh we've come to the other side and now you can see the sweep of the Medway and we talked about how the Medway is key to Rochester. It's also the key to Chattam. So, Chattam is closer to the sea than Rochester, which means that it is much more convenient should you be sailing an enormous tuda ship, which is what starts to happen in the 16th century because England is uh expanding its um global interests, trade, uh piracy, uh ultimately conquest, and the the Elizabeth and court starts to realize that it's ideally situated between London and the kind of the shipping lanes that lead to the world. So in 1568, Elizabeth I formally institutes Chattam as a royal dockyard and from that point on it plays a a fundamental role in the growth of the Royal Navy and the emergence of first English and then British engagement with the broader world which of course ultimately will result in the establishment of the British Empire. And obviously that is a process that takes centuries. And the emergence of Chattam as what it becomes in the the 18th and into the 19th century, the most futuristic place on the face of the planet is a huge huge long-term government sponsored plan of the kind perhaps you might say that the British state has slightly forgotten uh how to engage in. But born as much of failure as success, right? Because where we are now, the Medway is the location for one of the most disgraceful, perfidious, ultimately insignificant moments in world history, isn't it? Which is the Dutch raid on the Medway. They're bad people and they really let themselves down. Yeah. So that's in June 1667 and it's part of a se series of wars that England and the Dutch Republic are waging against each other. This is the second bout of war under the reign of Charles II who's um just come back after his exile in the Netherlands and we'll be hearing more about that in due course. Um and the Dutch and Charles II aren't getting on well at all in the 1660s. And as we say in in 1667, the Dutch sail up the Medway and they find that the defenses in place to protect the dockyards and all the ships that are um at anchor there just aren't up to scratch and they burn or capture 13 English ships and Dominic in in a shocking display of thieving. Um, they haul away HMS Royal Charles which is the flagship of the English Navy and disgracefully it's still on display in the Reichkes Museum to this day. Do you want to know what Daniel Defoe said? Yeah, tell me what he said. I know you like bit Daniel Defoe. He had he had pungent views about this. He said uh this alarm gave England such a sense of the consequence of the river Madway and of all the docks and yards. This alarm he changed his voice because it tore the countries to the countries. It picked up different um it picked up different accents. He said, "This alarm gave England such a sense of the consequence of the river Medway and of all the docks and yards at Chattam and of the danger the Royal Navy exposed to there that all these doors which were open then are locked up and sufficiently barred since that time and is not now in the power of any nation under heaven." Nation, I don't know what happened there. No, though they should be masters at sea, unless they were masters at land too at the same time to give us such another affront. I don't actually know what that last bit means because I was just so distracted by the accent. What does he mean? What he means is that um the raid on the Medway was such a shock to the British state that absolutely impregnable defenses were put in place all the way along the line of the Redway up to Chattam. Um and particularly at the mouth of the Eststerie going into the Medway. Uh and essentially he's saying that even if um naval supremacy were to pass from Britain, people still wouldn't be able to force their way in. Uh and the only conceivable way in which Chattum could be destroyed would be if there was a land invasion. A and Defoe is right because Chattam stands impregnable throughout the Seven Years War, throughout the Napoleonic Wars. And we talked in our episodes on Nelson about how Napoleon's plan for England if he could only get his troops across was to march straight on Chattam and destroy it. I mean, it would be the equivalent of knocking out, I don't know, a kind of nuclear defense system or something like that today. um and it uh it survives the first world war, it survives the second world war and throughout those um throughout those conflicts and also throughout the long decades of peace in the 19th century, Chattam I guess is both the the symbol and the fulcrum of Britain's role as a a great global power. So before that Tom just quickly because the school children are fighting their way up the stairs uh Britain was of course herself part of a great empire and it was a kind of node in the imperial network of the Roman Empire and actually we've been looking down at Watling Street and the great bridge haven't we just say a little bit more about that bridge cuz you love that bridge. Yeah. So, as you said, the first bridge over the Medway, probably probably a pontoon bridge, and then the Romans develop it with great stone peers and kind of wooden planks across it. And that bridge endures well into well after the um the collapse of of Roman power. And it's there probably up until 8th or 9th centuries when it gets rebuilt again. Um and the reason that it's so important, as we said, it's the quickest way to get from from Dover, which is the shortest crossing point from the continent up to London. And so it's not surprising that in the wake of the Roman withdrawal, Rome makes contact again with what's become Anglo-Saxon England, not with military means, but with spiritual means when um at the end of the sixth century, St. Augustine arrives um with a a band of monks to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxons. And his original plan is to get to London and establish um an archbishop Rick there, but they don't because London is kind of hostile territory. So famously they stop in Canterbury and that's why the head of the church of England is is in Canterbury to this day. Uh and that is where the first cathedral um in Anglo-Saxon England is built. But the second Anglo-Saxon cathedral um which is founded in 604 is down there from where we are standing and it's founded in um in Rochester by a guy called Justice who uh like Augustine is from Rome and it's incredibly old. I mean, Defo says it's it says it's not very interesting, but it I mean, it is interesting in the sense that, you know, this takes us right the way back to the earliest days of of the Roman church in uh in England, back to the age of Gregory the Great. And I, you know, I find it very moving a sense of a living link. Yeah. You love that, don't you? I do. It was given to Odo by William the Conqueror. No. Yeah. So, so Anglo-Saxon England comes to to to an end with the Norman conquest and um in our episode on that we talked about how William from Hastings goes to to do and captures it and then goes to London and he comes via Rochester. So, he sees that it's a an absolutely kind of crucial place to seize and so he his um his half brother Odo who is a a bishop but very fond of fighting. So, famously, you know, as a bishop you're not allowed to shed blood. So he kills people with a with a club or a mace. And William gives Rochester as a bishop Rick to Odo. But Odo is um he's a very bad man. He he um is very treacherous. And he gets chucked out. And so William gives it to this remarkable man who is called it's not Gandalf, it's Gandalf, but quite similar. and he has a slightly, you know, slight Gandalfesque role in in William's career because he's a man who who achieves extraordinary things. He's very as he's very very smart, very proficient at creating things. So, he's a great architect. Um he has um he's a great engineer. Um and it's Gandalf who builds the White Tower in London which becomes the kind of the basis for the the the Tower of London. Um, and in 1083 he starts work here in Rochester on renewing the Anglo-Saxon Cathedral that had basically kind of fallen to pieces. It was it was very decrepit. Um, not much of what he actually built it survives except for a place called Gondalf's Tower, which annoyingly we can't actually see from here. Um, but anyway, I mean, people are interested in Golf, you can still see his tower. So, this is great podcasting. Great podcasting. It really is. And it gets remodeled throughout the um throughout the Middle Ages. Um, it has a particularly bad time in the 13th century when King John, England's worst king, loots it and then Simon de Montford, the self-styled father of the English Parliament, um, he loots it as well. And I think there's always a sense that it's it's a little bit shabby. Um, a little bit shabby. So, um, that's how Peeps described it in the 16th century. And we heard Defoe um, saying it was ancient but not extraordinary. And again, I I I mean, I think that's kind of fair, but pick out some highlights. So there's a nice crypt. There's a crypt. So that was built by Gandalf. So Gandalf fans can see that as well as his tower. Uh you're excited about the great west door, aren't you? Very excited. Christ, and it's got justice and someone else. King Ethelbert who welcomed Augustine and his missionaries to to Ken. And uh there's another lovely ceiling with some green men. You love a green man. But most of all, the thing you were telling me which I was I found actually quite moving. You said one of the most something that had brought you closer to the dimension of the supernatural than ever before was um you went in 2019 you played mini golf in um in the center of the cathedral. So in 2019 following in the footsteps of St. Justice and Bishop Gondalf um the Cathedral Authority set up um a mini golf course in the nave of the cathedral. Well, can I tell people what you So Tom texted me after he played golf in the cathedral and he said, "Dominic, while playing adventure golf, I really felt that I I ref I reflected on the bridges that need to be built in our own lives and in the world today." And do you know what's amazing about that reflection that I had is that a few days later the um the the Dasis of Rochester put out a message saying that we hope that while playing Adventure Golf visitors will reflect on the bridges that need to be built in their own lives and in our world today. So yet again the Dasis of Rochester has been hacking our texts. Unbelievable. So on that bombshell Tom let's just move on very quickly to talk about Rochester Castle before we descend and allow the school children up here. Tell me about the history of Rochester Castle. So this is what Norman originally. Yeah. So um Defoe in that bit you read, I mean he was very rude about the cathedral, perhaps not unfairly, but he said that the the castle was just a ruin, which I I mean we're standing up here and you can see it's clearly not a ruin. Um it it we've got a a sign there saying it's unsafe for humans. 100 foot drop beneath. Generally this I mean this is very very impressive structure. Um, and it's not surprising because where you have um a very important river crossing, you want to have a very strong defensive system so that you can keep control of it. And so it's not surprising that as you say, yes, it is William who builds the first castle here because that's what the Normans are doing. Um, and again, he gives it, you know, he's given the cathedral to Odo. He also tells Odo to to to build a castle, which Odo does. It's made of wood. But when Odo gets chucked out for behaving badly and and treacherously towards his halfb brother, he hands the responsibility for the castle over to Bishop Gandalf. And we've said how Gondalf is a tremendous architect, a tremendous engineer. He gets to work building a a castle out of stonemasonry, probably one of the first stone castles to be built by the Normans after the conquest. Um, and it's because of that, I was just reading up in the Bodlian before we came up here that Gandalf apparently is recognized by the core of Royal Engineering as the man who established them. So, they kind of trace a line of continuity all the way back to uh to through the middle ages back to Gondalf. Um, and that I guess in part is is due to the the the reputation of of the Tower of London, but also due to this because uh although the keep where we're standing now was built in the 12th century, the walls uh are Gundals and this keep is I mean it's amazing. When you come into Rochester on the train, you can see it kind of looming up. I think it's the the tallest keep in England. One of the tallest keeps in the whole of of um of Europe. And again, it was built by not just a bishop, but by an archbishop. So, um, Rochester got given to the Archbishop Rick of Canterbury in the 12th century. We've had it in the show before. It's been in the rest of history. It has. So, it it um it featured in our episode on the on the peasants revolt, misnamed, but you know, this great rebellion of of of people in um in Essex, but also in Kent. And when the um the rebels want to march on London, they have to seize the castle first because it's the great key to the road that leads to London. And they manage to storm the castle and they capture the Castellan, the guy in charge of it. And they take him hostage. And when they get to London and they want to negotiate with Richard II and his government, the Castellan of Rochester Cathedral is the guy that they use to communicate between the rebels and the royal authorities. And basically through Rochester Castle's history, loads of big names have been here, haven't they? So King John of France when he was captured by the Black Prince, he was uh brought through Rochester, made a donation to the cathedral. Yes, that's nice. Henry V after returning in triumph from Azenor, you know, he has to get to Cala, crosses to Calala, uh rides the great road up to to London and passes through Rochester. Um, and he is not the last king to make a memorable procession through Rochester because there is another one who has left a real mark on the city. Um, we can't see that mark that he left from up here. So, I think we should um wind our way down the stairs past the uh sobbing school children um and allow them to come up here to the top and we will go down and go to this site which commemorates the arrival in Rochester in 1660 of Charles II. Tom Restoration House Rochester. That's where we are right now. an absolutely gorgeous example of um 17th century architecture. Uh we've just been shown around by the um owner Jonathan Wilmott. Um amazing artworks, furniture, and whatnot that you can see if you're watching on Spotify or on YouTube. But why are we here? Well, as you say, an amazing 17th century house. Uh origins going back to late 15th century, 16th century, all kind of patched together. Uh, so Pevnner rather rudely described it as being all highly peculiar and undisiplined, but I think it's unbelievably atmospheric, very different vibe to being on top of a a Norman castle. But we are here because um the most famous person who stayed here was Charles II who had been in exile throughout the restoration. Cromwell dies. People don't know what to do. So they say, "Well, let's try and bring Charles II back." So he lands in Dover. He's been staying in the Dutch Republic. Now he's back in English soil and he's processing towards London and he spends the night of 28th of May 1660 here and the next morning he gets up it's his birthday and he goes off into uh London. Um, and so hence hence the name Restoration House. But there's a brilliant literary connection, isn't there? And a connection with one of Rochester's or one of this area's favorite sons. Because am I not right in saying that Charles Dickens used this house where we're sitting right now as the inspiration for Satis House, which is of course Miss Havsham's house in his novel Great Expectations. I think for the purpose of this podcast, we can say 100% this was this was the inspiration. It is said that. No, no. Dickens was seen leaning on a kind of on a looking in at it um while writing Great Expectations, I think we can say 100%. And it actually for those who were looking on YouTube or or Spotify, if you imagine this setting covered in cobwebs and a mouldering wedding cake in the background, I think you can absolutely imagine Miss Havsham jilted at the altar in her decayed wedding dress, kind of gliding around like a ghoul. Paul Pip, you know, the little blacksmith's boy feeling very coarse and sorry for himself. Well, Great Expectations is very uh close to my heart, Tom, because I won um the school public speaking and reading competition four years in a row with the opening of Great Expectations. Four years in a row. The same reading. God, joyless. Were you allowed to do that? Not really. It was considered against the spirit, but not the letter of the law. That really does seem like cheating. By about the third or fourth time, the head of English said, "You're really ruining this for everybody else with this re with this reading that is unbeatable cuz it's such a brilliant reading." But you must be excited though to be here. Oh yeah. I mean, but that you know, you come home. That's the way I roll, Tom. That's the way I that's the way I operate. If I can if I can win and suck all the pleasure out of it for other people, so much the better. Let's talk about Dickens. The reason that he's kind of hanging out here gazing at the windows Yeah. is because um he actually had a house just outside Rochester, the other side of the Medway which was called Gads Hill Place. Yeah. And he lived there for the last 14 years of his life. Um and he absolutely loved Rochester. Basically everywhere you go in Rochester, you see Dickens Illusions. So restaurants, cafes, whatever. We've just been to the cafe cafe. Yeah. And there are kind of little signs saying Dickens, you know, this house was where so and so lived or whatever. and Gads Hill, the house um outside Rochester where he lived. He got given a a Swiss chalet by uh one of his friends and it kind of arrived like an IKEA pack in various boxes. Um and he want Dickens wanted to assemble it at a viewpoint where he could look out at the sea. So um the bottom of his garden there was a quite a busy road. So he dug a tunnel under the road and then he assembled the Swiss chalet on the far side of the road so that in the second floor where he had his study he could look out at the sea and be inspired by it. And that chalet apparently is um is still you can still see it um just off Rochester High Street. So if you like Dickens I mean there's no end of Denzian fun facts here. And the other famous thing associated with Dickens here is that it's the setting for his last novel, which he never completed, the mystery of Edwin Drew and the opium addict and cathedral organist, John Jasper, who almost certainly is the murderer of Edwin Drew. Or is Edwin Drew dead? Who knows? He lived um on one of the gates that's just below the castle where we've been. Um and the uh Rochester in Edwin Drew is called Cloysterham. Um and the Dickens description of it is very similar to Defoe. So he says um a city of another and a bygone time is close to him. All things in it are of the past. So there's that sense of Rochester as a place where you know the history of England is the layers of history. But as Dickens also knew the same cannot be said of Chattam and he knew Chattam very well because he had spent the formative years of his childhood there. And that's because his father John Dickens had worked as a clerk there, hadn't he? In the naval pay office. And so Dickens lived there from what the age of five to the age of 11. Yes. And and thought it was wonderful. Yeah. Had be kind of incredible childhood memories of it. Thought it was amazing. And then years later in 1860 when he was 48, he came back and you know was his first visit to Chattam since he'd been a boy and he wrote up about it expressing essentially his disappointment that it wasn't quite as amazing as he remembered it. and he was so disappointed and listeners to this podcast will be thrilled to know this that he called Chattam Douls. So maybe we could use that as a title for this episode. Um so but but then after a day touring um Chattam aka Dulsborough he left in a slightly more benignant mood. So he wrote, "When I went alone to the railway to catch my train, I was in a more charitable mood with Dulra than I had been all day. And yet in my heart I had loved it all day, too. Ah, who was I that I should quarrel with the town for being changed to me when I myself had come back so changed to it? All my early readings and early imaginations dated from this place, and I took them away so full of innocent construction and guardless belief, and I brought them back so worn and torn, so much the wiser, and so much the worse. Oh, Tom, that that's lovely. That's a lovely reading. And actually, that inspires me to um to go to Chattam. So, I think we should head off from uh Restoration House. I have to say what an amazing house this is and how royally we've been looked after. I actually I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I don't think I've ever been to a location with the rest is history that I have enjoyed more and that will live in my memory uh for longer than Restoration House. Well, do you know I'm I'm sat here looking at you. You're in a magnificent period armchair. Behind you is a ticking grandfather clock. I kind of think you should have this vibe for every recording of the rest is history. I think I kind of do already. No, I don't think you do quite. Oh, disappointing. But anyway, talking of talking of positive vibes, let's head off to Chattam High Street. This episode is brought to you by Uber. Now, do you know that feeling when someone shows up for you when you need it most? We all need that sometimes, and Uber knows it. Uber isn't just a ride or a meal delivered. It's showing up no matter what. Like for your long-distance friends, bringing soup when they're sick, sending flowers when they're down, when it really matters. Whatever it is, you show up. Where there's a will, we're on our way. Uber on our way. Download the app today. Welcome back to the rest is history. And very excitingly, we have now moved from Rochester to Chattam. Tom, let's walk up this lovely little slope here and discuss why you've brought us here. Well, Dominic, if you look here, it reads Gund Road. So, we are on Gondolf Road. Gund um very much friend of the show, the uh founder of the Royal Engineers, William the First's go-to bishop, the guy who designed Rochester Cathedral and the castle. Um and he got his hands on Chattam as well because although Chattam is very much a kind of 18th century 19th century place that's its heyday there was um a village here in the middle ages and Gundal founded um a hospital for the poor and lepous and they would be brought along the river which is just down there. Um, and then there would be kind of special passageways that would thread up from the river to bring them to the hospital because nobody wanted to come in touch with the leper and only the lepers were allowed to go up these. The hospital is long gone, but there is one remainder of it and it is this chapel that we're looking at here. So, the front of the chapel clearly very Victorian. This is by Sir Gilbert Scott who designed the Albert Memorial and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and and these kind of great monuments of Nao Gothic Victoria. But um if we go around the back we will find um a bit of the original 12th century chapel. And I like to think that um even though we are here in the heart of Chattam, the swirl of 21st century Britain, um maybe inside this chapel, there is a little haven, a little reminder of uh the age of faith. Um and we will see what we find inside. You can see this entrance. um this the eastern section there are still bits of the original 12th century chapel. So if we go in through here we can see you know because I I I imagine that there'll be a kind of a mood of cloistered peace maybe amid the the hurly burly of Chattam uh a reminder of the spirituality of the middle ages and I think it'll be very moving for people. So let's go and see what's going on. Well, this this is this is unexpected because so this is this is maybe not quite what I was expecting. So, we should uh we should maybe describe uh for people what we're seeing. And Dominic, is this is this this to me very much speaks of medieval spirituality. There are about four people writhing and grappling on the ground. Uh so, if you can't if you're not watching on Spotify or YouTube, that's what I'm looking at. Basically, somebody's thighs and they're wrapped around another person's neck. And and behind behind them are two signs reading granite gym. And um this ancient sanctuary, this repository of medieval spirituality uh seems to have become a a gym. So I like to think that this probably isn't what Bishop Gondolf wanted, but whatever. It's progress. But um but Dominic, just to say that is the So Harry, behind you, that is what remains of the 12th century chapel. So basically for those people not watching Thomas pointing at a bit of wall with um I don't know what else to say. Yeah. Well, well what I will say is that there aren't people kind of wrestling underneath the under that. So maybe showing a bit of respect. There is a sofa, isn't there? There is. So anyway, that's progress. So we have crossed the street and we've come a little bit further forward in time. So, we're now standing uh for those people who are not watching on YouTube or Spotify, we are standing in front of some lovely little brick arms houses. And Tom, these were built in 1592 and uh they're associated with a very famous name in kind of TUDA seafaring history. Yes. So, um this is the hospital of Sir John Hawkins in Chattam. It is the single oldest Royal Navy charity, the oldest um Royal Navy hospital. And as the name of the hospital suggests, it was founded by Sir John Hawkins, who was a cousin of Sir Francis Drake. Um, he was first the treasurer of Elizabeth's Navy, then its controller. He played a key role in establishing not just Chattam, but at the the English Navy as a force to be reckoned with. Um, and he was very anxious about what would happen to decrepit sailors, sailors who had kind of lost their fortunes or whatever. And so he um in his will he set aside some property to endow a hospital. Um which makes him sound one of history's good guys. But there is a slight complication which is hinted at at the on the the website for uh the hospital of Sir John Hawkins uh where it's it confesses that a lot of the money that Sir John Hawkins made which enabled him to fund this hospital was made in the slave trade. Uh and so this disavow is made although not out of step with the societal norms of his time. The governors fully acknowledge the aborant and brutal nature of this vile activity and regret Sir John's involvement profoundly. And then there's a kind of big however he was an outstanding seaman navigator, naval administrator and benefactor of naval veterans. All of which and both of those things are clearly true. Yeah. And so this is absolutely the kind of place that focuses some of the ambivalences and complexities of uh Britain's everybody loves focusing on ambivalence and uh he's a great Spanish man isn't he all of that he's roughs beards yeah you know playing bowls all of that yes I mean he's you know he he is one of the great kind of the Victorians loved him they loved the kind of idea that the sea dogs of under Elizabeth the first had been the prototype hype for for Britain's Navy. And this place had a tremendous history of sea dogy or sea dogging, didn't it? Because there was a lot of sea dogging going on there. They had two veterans of the Battle of Copenhagen who were here and a veteran of Trfalga lived here, right? Yes. Yes. Um a a guy called uh Henry Dawkins was was here. Now you said that this was built um in the TUDA period. These are not TUDA buildings. So actually it um it got rebuilt in um 1789, right? Um and then it got refurbished again um in the 1980s when it got opened by uh the Queen Mother. Oh, lovely. So, um so you've got John Hawkins, you've got redevelopment in the period of the the uh of the French Revolution, and you've got the Queen Mother. And I think that Dominic, you would agree that this is one of the many jewels of Chattam High Street. That's the rich tapestry of British history right there. But the exciting news is there are more jewels and I think we should go and look at another of them because our cameraman's about to be run over. So, let's go. What's so weak? So, a really weak clap there from Theo to start this uh this new segment. Now, Tom, one of the things that we associate with Dockland areas, of course, is pubs. And we are looking at two um splendid historic pubs. So, one of them is the North Falland. And I just want to give people an impression of the forensic research that you've brought to this episode. Yeah. So your notes say Nelson repeatedly drank here. So that's great. So that definitely happened. Uh so yeah. So I read that it was rebuilt in 1912 and shut in 2012. So an amazing Yeah. So I bet you're glad you've seen that now. Imagine if you'd been stuck in the cults all this time and you never got to see that. But a really amazing. There's more, isn't there? There's more. You You have not yet drunk your fill of the cup of historical delights that Chattam High Street has to offer. So, do you want to continue or are you laughing too much? No, I'm laughing too much, but I will continue. Um, come through. I'm just telling children to come through because Tom's ruining their day. Um, so opposite us, uh, is something called the ship in. And I read in Tom's notes, Tom's written the the words, "One of the oldest gay pubs in the country." I think that's definitely true. But then his citation comes from Kent. I'm laughing so much I can't speak. Kent online. It's a very reputable source. Um, very scholarly, peer-reviewed. So, do you want to read out what it says? Online. Yeah. Apparently, I feel like the word apparently is doing a lot of lifting, doesn't it? Apparently, the bart the bartender's mate recently compiled a history of Rochester High Street and proudly informed me, this is the writer from Kent online, that the pub is more than 500 years old and Medway's oldest, Gabe. Well, that's that that's definitely true. Not only this, but he confidently declared that the purple dance bar on the left, complete with its bricklook wallpaper, was the site of the first arrest and conviction for buggery way back in the days of Henry VIII. So apparently that from according to the barman's mate, the barman's mates, but actually there's some serious history behind this. much as I'm laughing about your ludicrous research, there's some serious history behind us that I'm hoping you've you've put um an equal amount of effort into. Well, I I I'm actually, do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to read from the foundation stone on this building, which reads, "This foundation stone was laid by Simon Magnus for a memorial synagogue in affectionate remembrance of his much lamented and only son, Lazarus Simon Magnus Esquire." So a synagogue on Chattam High Street is a reminder of the fact that as well as pubs, what you expect to find in um you know docklands and dockyards and all that kind of thing is lots of people from overseas and when the Jews were allowed back into England um in the mid- 17th century by Oliver Cromwell, my friend of the show Oliver Cromwell uh although not officially but uh effectively one of the earliest communities outside London uh where Jews settled was was in Chattam because of course it was growing. it was provided links to all the other Jewish communities on the continent. Um and uh and the first synagogue on this site was built in 1750. Um and the people who were able to fund it could do it because they were helping uh people in the Royal Navy who had captured prizes to then kind of sell the to convert it into money and they would take a cut and that cut then enabled them to fund the first synagogue. But this particular synagogue um opened in 1869 and it was um as the foundation said it was built by the father of this guy Simon Magnus who had been um a captain in the fourth Kent artillery volunteers and he'd also been a business partner of Ismbbard Kingdom Brunell the great engineer. So you know Gundalf Brunell all the great engineers are featuring in this story. Um, and we mentioned earlier about the leper hospital and about how there are these um paths that go from the river up to where the hospital was. And there was one of them that went along the west side of the synagogue. So, it's a kind of freehold of a strip of ground um which uh remains kind of you know you could they could they couldn't buy it and they have to this day they have to um pay a rent uh to use it of 5p per. So again a kind of fascinating link taking us back to the uh the medieval origins more of the of the extraordinarily rich and vibrant history of this part of the world. Yes absolutely and um and this synagogue is is still going strong and um during both the wars particularly in the second world war um it provided a home for Jewish servicemen who passed through Chattam and were working here. um and talking so we've talked about Nelson, we've talked about um the Second World War and the obvious place in Chattam where Nelson and the Second World War could join is the naval dockyards, the Royal dockyards. The reason that all these incredible treasures, Dominic, are lining Chattam High Street. So, I think that we should go there now. Let's do that. Right now, if you're watching this, you can see that we've moved location to somewhere very, very spectacular indeed. So, Tom, we have moved to Chattam's Royal Dockyard and we're in the bowels of the dockyard and a place we'll reveal in a second. But, so the dockyard is built in first opens in 1567 and lasts for what, just 414 years. Wow. Okay. Yeah. Closes in 1984. So, you love this place. They now the irony is that when we first did the rest is history you hated the Royal Navy you hated dockyards I hated rope above all you hated rope so it's um fitting that to apologize and to abase yourself you have come to the ropery of the raw dockard but just talk to me about the royal do before we go on to the ropery I do love the uh the dockyard here in Chattam uh and the reason for that it's a it's a phrase that nam Roger the great historian of the Royal Navy um expressed that the dockyards Portsmouth, uh, Chattam, places like that are 19th century islands in an 18th century sea. And you actually did, uh, you did a TV show here on HG Wells. And I guess you came here because that sense of it is has a science fiction quality. It's this idea of technology being ahead of the historical context because these are amazing places. These are where the most lethal killing machines on the face of the planet are developed. only the ships of the Royal Navy which over the course of the 414 years over 500 ships are built here including the most famous of all HMS Victory. Yeah. So Tom, our old friend Daniel Defoe had strong views about this place, didn't he? So I know you love a Daniel Defo reading because you admire his accent so much. He said uh the building yards, the docks, the timber yard, the deal yard, the mastard, the gunard, the rope walks, and all the other yards and places set apart for the works belonging to the Navy are like a well-ordered city. And though you see the whole place as it were in the utmost hurry, yet you see no confusion. Every man knows his own business. Yeah. Now the thing is he was talking about the rope walks and we are actually in the ropery which I mean you talked about nam roger and this idea of this being the 19th century in the 18th century at its peak this place the ropery was probably the most futuristic the most technologically and industrially advanced place on the planet. Now the sublime irony of this is that when we started the podcast you said there was nothing you hated more than naval rope and yet you have chosen this place to do this you basically this entire episode in fact probably the whole of the podcast has been building to this moment. Yeah. So what is it about tell me about the ropery I think it's one of the most amazing historic structures in Britain. Um, it's a great monument to the age of Nelson, to the rise of the Royal Navy, to global supremacy. Um, and as you say, it is a glimpse of the future. Um, built in the 1780s, 1790s. Um, it is it is 1,140 ft long. When it's built, it was the longest brick building in Britain. Um, it is absolutely stupifying. and some of the machinery here where they still make rope to this day, you can buy it around the corner. Um, it it dates back to 1806. Um, so if you want a flavor of what it was that powered Chattam, powered this stretch of the Medway, powered the Royal Navy, this is the place to come. So, in a way, Tom, this is where the Napoleonic Wars were won. This is where the um the Pax Britannica of the 19th century was established. This is what's powering all that. The great dynamo, the ropery, Chattam dockyard, um the Royal Navy, the infrastructure, the senuse of Britain's greatness. And of course, that continues all the way through to um the middle of the 20th century. And I think we should fast forward to the Second World War. Um and we should go out of here and we should go to an equally exciting historical site, which is a splendid ship. Let's do that. Let's And we will be ending this podcast by treading the metal boards of a British battleship. It really is TV. So Tom, we've been on an epic journey, haven't we? Through Rochester and Chattam. Now we've reached an earthshattering conclusion because we have come deep into the uh dockyard here at Chattam and we are on a second world war battleship. So tell me a little about this ship and why you've chosen this and and tell me a little bit about it story. Okay. Well, you know that I I love a Second World War battleship. Yeah. And to be more precise, I love a C-class destroyer, right? which is what this ship HMS Cavalere, a name that I like to think Charles II would very much have approved of. Yeah. Prince Robert, Charles the first. They'd all love it. They would all have loved it. Um, that's what this is. A C-class destroyer. What What's What's your favorite kind of destroyer? What What class? Probably B. Probably a B-class. Okay. But a C-class is quite good. I like all destroyers and I but I'd probably rank top three C, B, probably A. Okay. In that order. And also I think also very nice is the the color. So for those who can't see it's a kind of lovely turquoise and it blends in with the turquoise of the River Midway which is behind us. Gosh, that's why. So uh anyway so um that's a painterly eye. It absolutely is. So um this ship is uh it was launched in the Second World War. It fought in Norway. It fought it joined a convoy uh going to the Soviet Union and back. You say it surely. She she uh and then she um sailed out to join in the final stages of the war in the Pacific. So um absolutely a reminder of Chattam's role in the Second World War. But I think that um this ship is also a memorial to um the decline of Chattam um because this this ship got uh decommissioned in the 1970s and Chattam gets decommissioned in 1984. And really with the closing of the docks, so much that had made Chattam Chattam for 400 odd years ends. So I in a sense where we are now is a reminder both of Britain's glory days in the Second World War, but also of the geopolitical and economic decline that followed. Um, and in that sense, I think this is a perfect place to conclude that the journey, the odyssey that you uh you were talking about. So we've gone from Arnage Hill for Roman Bridge and now we are in the 1980s. So in a very real sense, Tom, we've covered all English history. The story of I was about to say one town, but really two towns, Rochester and Chattam. Yeah. But joined by a single high street. Joined by a single high street. And let's not end on a downbeat note. No. Because I feel what we've gained from this is a sense of the extraordinarily rich history of Chattam, but also that I've learned. What have you learned, Dominic? I've learned that Chattam's not just a town, Dominic. It's a community. And I think that's lovely. What about you? Yeah, can't argue with that. We've been uh we've been welcomed with such hospitality on the streets. I think we've learned a lot from streets of Chattam. The people of Chhattam probably more than the people listening to this podcast have learned from us. I hope that they've learned something which is uh go to Rochester High Street, walk down it, get to Chattam High Street, then come to the docks and uh you couldn't be happier that all of all of all of English history is there. On that shocking bombshell, we should probably say goodbye to Chattam, goodbye to Rochester, and goodbye to the listeners. Goodbye. Goodbye.
