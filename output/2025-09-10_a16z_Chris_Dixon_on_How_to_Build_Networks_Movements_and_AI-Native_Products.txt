Why do some consumer products explode into networks that reshape the internet, while others fade away?

Today on the podcast, a16z general partners Anish Acharya and Chris Dixon take on that question. Anish invests in AI-native consumer products and the next wave of consumer tech. Chris is best known for his work in Web3 and network economies, and he’s also led some of a16z’s biggest consumer bets.

Together, they cover the history and power of consumer networks, the exponential forces that shape how they grow, and what it all means for founders building in the age of AI.

Whether you're an investor or entrepreneur, the most important thing to start with is to look for these forces, to look for these exponential forces. You can do all sorts of tactical product things, everything else. But these forces are going to overwhelm you for better or worse. How intentional do you think you have to be as a founder about building like you're building a tool, do you have to be sort of thinking about the network a priority or can the network sort of emerge? Because in AI so far, we've seen a lot of tools and not a lot of networks. What's your instinct? Welcome to the A16Z consumer pod. I'm super excited and honored to have my partner Chris Dixon here today. You know, Chris, you're probably best known for your work in web 3 and network economies recently, but what folks may not know is that you led a lot of the most important consumer investments at Andre Horowitz and prior you also founded two consumer companies. I thought a fun place to start would be networks. That feels like the first place you really cut your teeth. So maybe talk about your investments in Stack Overflow, Pinterest, Instagram, and how you generally think about consumer networks. So many of the most important internet services are networks, right? Going back to the early internet, um email and the worldwide web, which are still of course around and really important, um are networks, right? And they're networks in the sense that um the service gets more valuable as more people use the network, right? If you were the only one on email, it wouldn't be particularly valuable. um during the you know the kind of the rise of the internet in the 90s and 2000s that's when you had things like YouTube and Facebook and uh later on Instagram and and a whole bunch of other really important networks you know if you're an entrepreneur or an investor during that period they you know they tend to be very valuable companies they're very hard to build and we can talk about that later there's different kind of tactics and strategies for doing that um and so yeah so when I you know I my background I started two companies first was a consumer security company and the second was a consumer AI company um and then was a personal investor. I co-founded a seed fund called Founder Collective which was investor in things like Uber and Venmo and Stack Overflow as you mentioned and just you know sort of were involved in a bunch of these networks as the internet evolved. Um, I think to to really talk about networks though, it's important to kind of step back and the way I think about to me a foundational question in tech is is why do you know why in tech do you have these these companies come out of nowhere and end up being you know very impactful having hundreds of millions or billions of users being very valuable um in a way that you typically don't see that in other industries right like what's what's fundamentally different about tech and I think the answer is that in tech you have some very strong kind of exponential superlinear forces. Um so the most famous example of that is Moors law right? So Moors law is the idea that you can that sort of every you know roughly 2 years or 18 months the the uh performance of semiconductors doubles. Um it's a rough approximation but it's basically been true. You've seen this compounding improvement in in processor performance. I think there's also kind of a broader Moors law which is you know storage networking like all the kind of computing resources has gotten much better which is why you have things like mobile phones right so if you go back and look pre iPhone you know mobile phones were pretty junky and limited in capability and didn't have you know touchscreens and and had poor performance um and what you know Steve Jobs and Apple's great insight was was that actually by the way the first iPhone also I you know I I was I think I was one of the people that bought the first day also was quite limited but you know part of their brilliance was they saw this curve, right? They saw this exponential curve and they rode that curve and that um so so that Morris law is a very important exponential curve. But this the other kind of I'd say there's two other really important exponential curves in software. One is what I call composability. Composability is really I think what's accounted for the rise of open source software. Um you know why did Linux go from a hobby project in the '9s to the dominant operating system on in the world today? Um the answer a lot of it is composability. Composibility means the software is open source. anyone can contribute to it and you can very importantly sort of harness the collective intelligence of the internet as opposed to locking up you know only relying on your employees right anyone in the world can can uh you know the famous phrase all all bugs are shallow with enough eyeballs and you know and really importantly with open source you can they become software becomes like Lego bricks where anyone can take a piece and reuse it and so you get this kind of compounding exponential kind of improvement growth and then the third really important exponential force in tech is network effects as we were talking about which is which is why networks are so important right so they start off often um quite limited you know Facebook was just at Harvard and it was essentially a you know a a real time you know kind of yearbook or whatever for students at one school and of course you know then kind of hopped by lily pads to other schools and high schools and you know eventually to kind of global domination that we have today um and so they saw you know Mark Zuckerberg and the team saw the this power of network effects and uh and kind of rode those network effects. Um and so that's you know that's kind of why I mean Klay Christensen calls this disruptive technologies. It's a it's this kind of puzzle in a way of why in tech you know you have these very strong incumbents who seem to miss um you know I think you could tell the story today about maybe Intel and Nvidia or something like Intel or even Chad GBT and Google you know I was just reading that's a great example. Yes. is that, you know, neural networks 10 years ago were kind of toys, right? Um, yes. And I mean, they were cool and I think, you know, some a bunch of people saw the potential of them. Um, but the reality is they just didn't work that well, right? I mean, I remember there was a chatbot uh kind of VC thing in like I want to say like 2016 or something. I if you remember that you chat chat bots had a moment back then. Yeah, they had a moment, but you know, the reality is it just they weren't that good, right? Um, they just couldn't do the job. Um, but of course they got much much better and the genius of OpenAI and other pioneers in the space was to make that bet, right? That's right. Um, and then like Google today is in kind of an awkward position, right? Because they have this huge incumbent business that depends on, you know, the sponsored links and they're trying to layer in AI and do things like that. But it, you know, in some ways it it it didn't come out of nowhere, but it it grew it grew, I think, faster than even some of the optimists predicted. It improved faster. And so so so the kind of the the big takeaway here is I think whether you're an investor or entrepreneur the most the the most important thing to start with is to look for these forces to look for these exponential forces. And one of the lessons I learned in my career was you know you can do all sorts of tactical product things but these forces are going to overwhelm you for for better or worse. And that the first thing to understand is that kind of landscape of these forces and how they're moving and how you can hopefully be on the right side of them. Chris, how how intentional do you think you have to be as a founder about building like you're building a tool? Do you have to be sort of thinking about the network a priority or can the network sort of emerge? Because in AI so far we've seen a lot of tools and not a lot of networks. So how and of course in hindsight everybody was designing a network from day zero. What's your instinct? That's a great question. So like like I wrote a blog post years ago called come for the tools stay for the network and the idea was I was observing a what I observed as sort of a tactical pattern among entrepreneurs. I I cited Instagram as an example so people won't young people won't remember this but Instagram actually kind of initially um you know that it its network Instagram's network was not a big part of the product. Um it had a button where you could share on Instagram but why would you do that cuz no one was on it. And so what you would do is I think two things. One is they had these cool filters which at the time you had to pay for and other services and they gave them away for free. Um so kind of just you know effects or lenses or whatever you want to call them and then um and then secondly they piggybacked off other networks. So you' share to Twitter um and then I think like a year or two later Twitter blocked them and there's a whole kind of thing. You see that today maybe with Substack um you know Substack starts off right piggybacking on the email network on Twitter. My my my sense is they're now getting traction with their own network. you go to the Substack app, right? Um that's right. And and so I think it's kind of a similar tactic. I think you can see some of this kind of come for the tool stay for the network in this is I'll defer to you on this because I'm not as up to date, but like modern productivity tools like maybe like Figma, notion, things like this where they're useful single player, right? you can just go to notion and it's a really nice way to edit a document or Figma to you know kind of do design but also you you know you there are social features that I I think become essential um there's always these things are all degrees right like Google Docs I love Google Docs I use it I use the social features the reality is is it really a network like I could probably switch and then just share links with somebody else but the social features layer on other some products like Instagram it becomes essential right like it's just you simply can't leave Instagram if you have a following and you want to keep that following. Um, so it it kind of varies by use case. But I think the point, by the way, I think you see some of this now in like Stripe doing the link product, you know, which is a payment app. I think shopify and the shop product, right? I think it was a really nice user experiences, you know, I don't have to type in my credit card again. Now there's kind of a network, right? Shopify originally was just kind of a tool for sellers for a merchant to get online. That's right. Um, so I think it's a really powerful tactic, right? Because because network effects cut both ways because network effects are great when you have them but they're really hard in the beginning. No one wants to be on a dating site with like two people, right? I mean or something, right? And so like how do you make these things useful from day one? But then the problem with single player, right, is it's just hard to defend them, right? You see I think you're seeing this in AI now today. You tell you you know much better, but you're seeing a lot of like really cool tools because it's an amazing technology. But then it's like okay, you can change your face app or whatever. Um but then how does it sort of move beyond fattishness, right? how does it move to something that that really engages people over a long period of time? And often the answer in consumer products is networks. And so then you then you have to layer in a network. The challenge is of course you don't want to just layer it in for the sake of it. You need to actually be useful. Um so yeah, I'd love to hear from you. What are you seeing in that area? Yeah. Yeah. You know, well it's actually interesting. It feels like the big networks have become um hyper sensitized to this idea of new networks emerging that were bootstrapped on their networks. So I think Twitter of 10 years ago would have you know been a lot more asleep at the wheel to the threat of Substack and they were pretty aware of this potentially happening and of course Facebook has deplatformed a ton of companies that they thought were going to do this and Insta and others. So one I think the networks are more sensitive and then on the tool side actually because the tools have been specializing in their own directions and part of it is sort of product features but part of it even for some of the multimodal tools is um aesthetics. you know, MidJourney just has a different aesthetic than IOG. So, they can both coexist and they're not directly competing. So, even though the tools are seemingly substitutes, like so far we haven't seen that trade-off and they're all working. Maybe that's just where we are in the product cycle. But, I do think it's sort of a topic for a lot of AI founders, which is like there's not an obvious network to build around a lot of these tools and how much of that should be sort of pre-esigned versus let's just keep pushing the edge and the network will emerge. And also the the it will show up in two ways, right? Like one would be in the usage. Like you you might see some of these tools not get used as much, but the other is in pricing, right? Like yeah, even if you carve out a niche, how much more were people willing to pay for that niche versus those competitors, right? So yes. Yeah. And actually prices have been going up interestingly. You know, like Google's top skew is 250 a month. Gro is 300 a month. I don't think we've ever seen a time where consumers were paying those kinds of prices. I mean one of our our sort of extreme views here is that like the future of consumer disposable income will be like food rent software you know then software is going to subsume a lot of the other areas of of discretionary spend today. Um, yeah, it's also possible. I've always suspected in tech we in Silicon Valley kind of we underestimate the power of just kind of brands and consumer inertia. And I think you're sort of seeing that today with chat GPT of just like such a household name like overnight almost um that even though it doesn't have in this sort of technical sense maybe network effects um I mean memory and things but I mean it's not that's more stickiness network effects but like you know just the brand the brand effects are so powerful right and you become kind of known and the cursor is known as the best you know best vibe coding platform or whatever that's right yeah I was going to ask you about that Chris so you know of course network effect is gold standard for defensibility. Um, you know, you've maybe talked a little bit about how brand is underappreciated, you just mentioned it. Do you think being a high-end PS DAU product is that enough of a moat? Um, or do you think that like we really have to push for sort of these building around these compounding forces? Yeah, it's a really interesting question. I mean, one one argument would be the internet I think there's a decent argument. I was actually having this argument at one of our partner off sites, not argument, but discussion. um is that maybe you know maybe a lot of the the network effect has been externalized to the internet right um and so the idea being you know your cursor and then suddenly all of the you know it becomes popular um or you know midjourney let's say right and then you get all of these you know midjourney influencers YouTube videos how-to guides and so you still in some sense have a network effect but it's just not a network effect that's in the product itself it's sort of externalized to the internet, right? And maybe that's a difference now like when I the era I'm discussing was the era when the internet was being built. In some ways the internet is built now. I mean I'm sure it'll hopefully improve and change but it's built right. I mean it's built and it's you know five billion users and um and so you know maybe the rules are different now and maybe now um that effect of getting sort of all of those different you know the the adjacent networks around you gives you in a sense a network effect. you try to show up top in search chat GPT recommends you you know the algorithms feature you like you know and there's of course there's a soft sense of like a brand people have heard of you but it's also this whole giant kind of system right with all of these different interconnecting networks um might strongly favor those products and that then it becomes sort of a timing thing right you get in early you you you um the timing seems quite important like getting in you know being the the first to kind of own the own the meme team in the category and and get that effect going and then maintaining it through product velocity and high quality and everything else which is non-trivial is very hard to do I think particularly in AI you tell me but um to always stay on the cutting edge um it's expensive a lot of capital that's another thing by the way the capital effects in AI right you you do well you raise the most money um I you know I assume the people raising a billion have already you know proven a bunch of things and at some point the capital becomes a moat, right? 100%. Yeah. No, it's it's very interesting because there's this barbelling that's happening even in software where the bigs are getting bigger, but we're also seeing the sort of, you know, the like single person 100 million run rate company is coming or maybe it's already here. Um, but certainly the bigs are getting bigger and capital is a part of that and maybe maybe the market's just so big that you can that the answer is both. All of the above. It may just be that, as you said, it becomes like food and rent and it just software is moving beyond kind of the quote unquote software budget. It really hasn't been zero sum so far. It's been shocking like prices are going up and everything feels like it's working. So, you know, maybe we'll look back and say that was a sign, but um but so far so good. You know, Chris, I I thought actually since you mentioned vibe coding, it would be fun to talk about movements. You know, it feels like you've been early to a bunch of movements. you know, products like um Coinbase, of course, and Makerbot, you know, those felt like niche communities on the internet when you started paying attention to them. You know, h how do you think about investing in movements and how do you think about building around them when there's sort of questions around is this a toy? Is this something sort of structural? Is it durable, ephemeral? Um maybe talk a bit about that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a little bit to the point we're talking about about the networks becoming externalized. I used to spend a lot of time, I don't know, 10 to 15 years ago just like on subreddits in in kind of niche communities partly because I'm interested in that stuff and partly because I think they're very powerful. Right? If you have, you know, if you look at Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, like a lot of these kind of interesting kind of movements like community sites, like they're they're often like 20,000 people. Like they aren't that many. They aren't the millions that you might think. there's millions maybe doing a little bit here and there but I just think a lot of you know and if you look at open source software and crypto projects like um just a lot of things that that that that have been kind of uh you know popular movements that grew were really led by a relatively small I mean I'm saying on the internet scale relatively small sort of hardcore enthusiasts who are really smart often technical um and so you know and it's sort of this you know famous old quote I think Williams Gibson that the future's already here it's just not evenly distributed Like I've I've always believed that I think if you just go back historically that's that's the case that like you know we're talking about neural networks like that's been going on for since 1943 or something and there's been you know communities of people including like the people a lot of the people that lead the labs today who you know 15 years ago were seen as kind of niche more niche or something you know they weren't neural networks weren't the dominant uh you know approach um and so you know with that thesis sort of you want to sort of find the next thing the next big thing. Like one way to do it is to look around and and see where these kind of you know I would describe it as sort of hyperenthusiastic sometimes cultish you know they have their own language their own norms um uh you know kind of a sense of insider outsiders um and so I got into that kind of a while ago and that's how I got into originally like into Bitcoin you know is I just followed those people and I found it was one of those things where it sounded kind of silly at first and then as you learn more about it seemed a lot more interesting. thing like that's always an interesting feature, right? There's some things you learn more about and they aren't they aren't that interesting. Some things, you know, they are kind of silly. You know, the moon the the conspiracy theories that the earth is flat or something like I went in one day hour looking at that stuff and it's like this stuff is just crazy or something or I don't know the moonlanding conspiracies or whatever. Um whereas you know you dig into this stuff and you don't have to agree with everything but there's smart people and it's very interesting. Um so you know for like for me it was like 3D printing like this led to my investment in Oculus and Coinbase really we're both from that. Um you know from that thesis sort of VR seeing the developers and the kind of you know Kickstarter community enthusiasm around you know when Palmer Palmer Lucky was first creating that. Um the uh it also you know I got into kind of neutropics and that led to an investment in in things like soilent and um got into back then it was like this is like when I joined the firm 2013 like drones we did a few investments around that um and you know just sort of looking at these interesting kind of hobby and the hobby communities I mean there's a bunch of reasons why is I think it's interesting way to look at it is one is those are the people that create these things I mean if you have 20,000 hard you know interesting technologists they often build things right and so they're going to Phil's mentioning products. It's also like a great kind of marketing engine, right? They they're out there. They often have sort of outsized influence on the internet. They have followings. Um, you know, they they help kind of get the energy and uh energy going and and uh and build things and kind of market them. Um it's not like it's not foolproof and you have it's hard you know because a lot of these things just end up kind of being niche or don't have um I think it's going back to the exponential forces like yeah you take neutropics like that's still a thing that's around but I don't think it's you know it hasn't created a big tech company as far as I know um but I think it's partly because it's just got linear forces not exponential forces behind it right there's only there's not sort of some engine exponentially driving it to have better and better products maybe actually though you if you look at a company like function health you function health is sort of the catalyst for this huge movement consumer movement around health and quantified self and you know neutropics was a bit of the predecessor to that. So in a sense there is this sort of slow exponential maybe and then very rapid uptake and I think timing is is a really interesting question here because with these movements you don't know if they're going to play out over you know 100 years or 100 days sometimes. Yeah, and you're right, like it make it could just be that like 3D printing is a good example where um you know it's still around. I don't it didn't kind of get as big as people had hoped. Um um you know I had an investment in Makerbot back in back then which got was a kind of a leader and got acquired and um you know it's still a hobbyist thing. It's interesting. I think the limiting thing is in the physical world there isn't kind of a Moors law driving it. That said, I expect that over, you know, 50 years or something, it will become a more important thing. And you're right, right, it could just be a timing thing. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the the vibe coding thing to come back to that that feels like this sort of irreversible consumer phenomenon, you know, where everybody is maybe not quite programming, but you know, creating software in a way that they weren't 10 years ago. How do you think of that as a sort of decentralizing force? You know, you've talked about the economics of software versus the means of production. the means of production are sort of getting decentralized through these new tools like replet and you know and and others cursor is that like sufficient to lead to a renaissance in the open web or what do you think are the second order implications of everybody programming yeah it's a great question I mean the thing with the internet and the consolidation I mean the internet has become increasingly consolidated if you just look at um and you know I wrote a book about blockchains and this was a kind of core theme in the beginning of the book was talking about sort of what happened with the internet getting consolidated. Um it just if you look at metrics like the amount of money revenue generated the um the traffic right I mean it's it's more and more it's like 95% plus of that both of those metrics are you know now in five to 10 companies hands um you can make an argument either way like with AI you know look with AI I mean we're already seeing this in the data um a lot of AI obiates the need to click through and go to a website right um and so and I think we just saw I think we just a report out that like a bunch of like travel sites and others were kind of seeing some alarming drops in SEO. um which I think is kind of inevitable if you know look I mean it's it's a mixed thing like on the one hand as I'm I'm a user of chat GPT and it's amazing to just get an answer right not have to go and like searching again after you you know and go through all these websites and look and it's sort of this uh vicious cycle thing where like the websites lose traffic and they get more desperate and then they put up pop-up ads and other things and so it becomes even a worse experience I mean this has been going on for like 10 years is this kind of kind of negative flywheel I that's been going on. Um, so look on the one hand it's great for consumers. You get an I mean vibe coding and a lot of you know we were investors in Stack Overflow which you know got acquired but I think their traffic has dropped a lot because of vibe coding and you know it's this thing where vibe coding I think probably some of the training data came from Stack Overflow and GitHub and places but then it becomes better and like you know look I I use I've used cursor to do some fun projects. It's an unbelievable tool. I think it's clearly good for the world. um you know that the uh it is you know bad for those websites. It's a great question. I think you know I I I hope what we're seeing is a renaissance of p it seems like we're seeing a paid software of of sort of businesses that you know they don't need to dominate the internet um and and be Facebook but they can get to hundreds of millions in revenue. I mean I think we're seeing this right um and so I think from an entrepreneurs perspective it's a very very exciting time. I think we can see a lot of um great products. I think it's a great time for consumers. You're you know you're um maybe that will change over time. Maybe they'll need to layer in ads and the incentives will shift um and do you know kind of things that are more adversarial towards consumers. I think right now I like the AI thing products and that they feel very aligned with users um like they're really just genuinely trying to create great products and and charge for them. Um Exactly. So yeah. Yeah. We sort of call it this like emergence of narrow startups where they charge high prices and deliver you know exceptional value and and maybe a controversial statement right now is that there are no marketing problems only product problems because the technology allows you to be so ambitious on behalf of your customer and then the costs actually ironically lead to better business models because consumer founders need to think about monetizing early otherwise they're just going to go to business. Um, so there's it it does feel like there's a renaissance in paid software that's happening that makes it a more fun time to build than 5 years ago. Do you think that over time um that that will shift potentially because people will realize that maybe the kind of low hanging fruit is picked that higher paying consumers and to get the rest you need to layer in different business models, ad based business models and so forth or I don't know. No, I mean it feels like there's so many more consumer needs that are addressable and they're addressable in a s such a significant way by the technology that you can actually specialize and go very very deep. Like there, you know, there's AI therapy generally, then there's AI therapy for people that have ADHD and then there's people who have ADHD that are in a certain life stage that perhaps want to interact in a certain way. You can just go extraordinarily deep. So I I don't know if it leads to consolidation over time or or you know or if you can continue to specialize and you know for a small number of people be their primary that actually might lead to a good topic around the idea maze. You know Chris you've talked a bunch about platform shifts. You've invested around platform shifts. You predicted them. You know one of the interesting things about this platform shift is that the properties of the platform are sort of emergent. They're not explicitly defined by Apple as iOS was. there are things that founders you know and even the people training the models are discovering does that sort of change your mental model around platform shift and and maybe how similar or dissimilar is that to web 3 yeah I mean so the idea maze concept this originally came from our friend biology shivasan um and I wrote about it a while ago the idea the way I think about the idea is that is that there was this old debate of like are with startups are the ideas more important or the execution right and sort of I think with the idea the way I think about it is it says is they're both important in the sense that it matters which maze you enter. I'm entering the AI maze for you know health healthcare or I'm entering the AI maze for image generation or whatever like clearly the idea and you go in with an initial product idea and clearly that matters but it also matters that you know it's a maze meaning it's dynamic the world will shift like you can't predict it so you know the canonical example in my mind is Netflix right Netflix started off you know mailing CDs right so the hypothesis is that movies will become you know the internet has changed way people consume movies, people will subscribe to them, but today we need to send them by mail. And then over time they pivoted to digital distribution. And then they pivoted to and then they started getting push back from the content providers and they pivoted to original content. Right. So they really did two almost complete company pivots. But their core maze was right. Right. Their core maze was like the internet will lead to subscription movies in some broad sense was correct. But then they were extremely agile with respect to the implementation of that right and so I think to me that's you know that that's the idea maze concept is you're sort of you're you're entering a maze as an investor and as a founder you need to think am I a person who wants to be in this maze for 10 years am I willing to be you know agile and and and often you know persevere through difficult periods um it's often emotionally challenging I think but not just intellectually challenging um and so so that's kind of the life of a startup. Now when you think about AI look we have a very clear mega trend of these you know of AI being you know it's intelligence it's it's a very broad um and important uh technology obviously every I think everyone knows that and then secondly you have these scaling laws which seem to be you know which seem to be quite powerful right it's the models are getting much better and then I think an important distinction there would be there's specific scaling things like LLM pre-training or something which I I think people may have debates about, you know, at what point do you have diminishing returns? Maybe we're hitting that. I don't know. Defer to the experts. Um, but then there's that sort of a process, but then there's the meta process. And the meta process is AI overall, right? There's people working on whatever uh reinforcement learning and I'm sure 100 different techniques. Now AI, the sort of meta process, which means like it's at this point really an economic phenomenon. Um, which is there's all these smart people there. There's business models behind it. There's funding, right? There's not just one process. There's many processes being explored. Kind of reminded me of Moors law. Like from the outside, Moors law, I think like naively, I'm not a semiconductor person, is like, "Wow, these semiconductors magically get better every two years." If you read books about it, read a few books about it. From their perspective, they run, you know, some fabrication technique, hits a wall, they freak out, and then some brilliant person from another lab comes up with a new fabrication technique, right? And so it was always each process would run you know and have diminishing returns asmtote at some point you know but the meta process the sort of the bigger industry flywheel uh did not you know led to this smooth growth I think my sense is AI is in that kind of you know semiconductor-l like place where you have this meta process that's very likely to continue scaling exponentially for a very long time and that creates a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs it's also a challenge right I mean the opportunity obviously is you can build things with the capabilities will grow. There'll be all these new opportunities and so forth. The challenge is, you know, are the incumbent models going to be sort of god models that subsume your use cases and how do you kind of play that, right? Um, and so, you know, I think what you're seeing, right, is that you see people say, well, I'm going to go so deep on a domain um that that will be my edge. you know, I know everything about this specific domain and I and I know that, you know, no matter no matter what the, you know, incumbent models do, I'll always be able to have an edge in my product or I'll have such a good brand recognition or strong user base or reference selling or whatever it might be, right? Um so I think that's the both kind of threat and I if you go back in his like with the semiconductor analogy I mentioned like you know the canonical case study in um in in Klay Christensen's uh integrator dilemma book is uh you know the hard the PC industry the hard drive makers you know and it was this very like kind of fruitfly Darwinian struggle where you just had like thousands of companies and very short life cycles for a lot of the companies um but you know but then a lot of very successful companies so you know it's it's kind you it may be a very kind of brutal process um for for entrepreneurs in the sense of just like a lot of competition a lot of other smart people you know very dynamic idea maze but also massive opportunity how do you think Chris about native versus gummorphic technologies in that context you know everything is changing especially when you're building for consumer does a consumer change their preferences when they get you know this magical new technologies invented or in a sense does the emergence of the native technologies also dependent on sort of consumer preferences changing and being informed by these external forces about things like AI. Yeah, great question. So just maybe I'll define the term first. So skuorphic native what skuorphic um is a term Steve Jobs used to use with respect to design to talk about how he likes some design like the original book bookshelf app book app on the iPhone had like grainy grainy stuff on the background design that kind of took or the trash can on the on the you know on the desktop computer desktop sort of you know right it it hearkens back to a to a different uh form factor. It's a common pattern in technology and media is when you have a new uh new platform or media form um develop is that people start off kind of imitating prior media form. So early films you know were shot sort of like plays with a camera and a better distribution model and then people kind of invented a native grammar of film um and you know close-ups and establishing shots and all all those kinds of things. Um, early internet, a lot of the 90s internet looked like, you know, you take a cat a catalog, you know, a a a commerce catalog and put it online or a brochure and put it online. And it took 10 to 15 years before you had things like YouTube and, you know, modern social networking and things that really just couldn't have existed prior to the internet, you know, user generate, anyone can upload a video and things. So I think some of it is um some of it's the technology like YouTube you couldn't have had until you had really wide broadband penetration right so some of it's the underlying technology takes a while to kind of get there um YouTube also you know when I started off it was just like funny viral videos a lot of it was copyright violations it took a while to develop kind of native YouTubers right content creators so that's often just like a generational thing I think I think it literally is a new generation sometimes right people that just that that don't look at the technology as a threat but as an opportunity Um and um and so that you know that was a big part of it. Um and then part of it's the entrepreneurs just have to figure out that it's the idea maze thing, right? They just have to figure it out like what do people want? Like a lot of people there was a lot of debates in around YouTube's time is do people want just take football and you know take NFL and stream it to the web. There were a lot of companies doing that. Tastes aren't going to change. Why would people want to watch you know four people joke around or something right? Maybe there were analoges like is that like talk radio or is that this? But it just they really just didn't understand. So you know I don't think human nature changed. I mean obviously there's a new generation with different ideas. I mean I don't think fundamentally humans changed you know in in a in a deeper sense but but you know it was understanding the capabilities of technology the cultural shifts around it the network effect around it. And so with you know I I personally think with AI a really interesting question and I'm sure you've thought much more deeply about it than I have. It does. I mean, most likely we're in a skuorphic phase right now, right? And and what is the native phase gonna look like? Like what is I think it's going to be and usually that for me at least personally, I like the native phase better because it's kind of crazier and more interesting. Um, and you know, so what would uh, you know, if you look at image generation, they're kind of just basically taking what illustrators do and but one one thing I would mention is um, like a cool thing with with photography, I think, is that, you know, when it first came along, it seemed like a threat to representative painting and you saw kind of art move to more abstract art to kind of get away from that. And I think you know you go back and read stuff at the time and there was a lot of kind of hand ringing around that like is this going to you know kind of cheapen this art form. Um but but an interesting thing happened right which is a new art form emerged which is film right so you took you took you wasn't just you're copying so in some sense like photographs were the skumorphic kind of quote unquote app of cameras but film was a native one right you had a new art form um and I wonder about that with AI like right now you have the kind of image generation which is kind of you know taking what a human might do and automating it and movie generation and the other kind of videos we see online um but is there a new medium for example that hasn't emerged yet is you know, maybe it's a virtual worlds or something. It's probably a bunch of hypotheses as of what it could be, but my experience has been is often surprising and it's hard to predict. Um, but that's where a lot of the cool creative interesting stuff comes in. It may it may take another generation or, you know, 5 to 10 years for like a new set of AI native kind of kids to grow up. That's right. Yeah. It's actually really interesting because we're in a sense we're in the command line era of AI and there's some things that you know you can articulate well with words but if I describe to you like what kind of music do you like it's hard to say you know we don't have the language for it most people to say well I like a certain sound with a certain sort of aesthetic and it's moody but not too moody and it's 110 beats per minute like most people lack the language to articulate the art that they love. So even the idea of prompt to media feels skumorphic and there's got to be like a more native way to explore it. I don't know what that looks like yet, but I'd be surprised if it's prompt in the long term. I mean prompt like I guess people are now calling it context engineering, not prompt engineering, which I think is a nice or some people are, right? Which is I think is a nice rephrasing because that is kind of what you're doing, right? Is you're taking the fact that all of this stuff I do in the real world that chat GPT isn't able to see, right? Right. And I'm trying to summarize all that knowledge that's that's hidden to it, the context, and put it in there. All right. Um, and that does feel like something that should be automated, right? You have these intelligible machines. I think that's what people I assume that's what they're doing with these potentially new ambient devices people are creating. Yeah. I mean, even in the media case, you know, like my Spotify library is probably much more useful for generating music that I like versus my articulation of it. That's right. You had mentioned in another pod that you know if you had one one sort of issue to get passionate about in the world of AI was open source and open source AI. Do you do you want to speak to that for a moment? Well, we were talking earlier about the democratization of the web or how kind of consolidated the internet is or technology is. I you know I think I would argue and I think a lot of people would argue that open source software has been an incredibly important force for democratizing technology, right? I mean, the reason that you can get a a Android phone for $10 and and get on the internet so cheaply, right, is you're is that basically all the software is free. I mean, imagine if there was an open source and you know, operating system providers used to charge $100 and you'd be paying that on client and maybe on the back end and there's a whole other set of stack of software that you'd be paying for and instead you're not. Most most internet users are, you know, the vast majority of the kind of bits being hit are are open source. Um it also is what makes you know startups exist right? we can fund startups and they can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and you know or even less sometimes and be up and running with you know really competitive great software and that's because of open source right so so we you know I think about a lot and I think you know on a policy side as a firm we've been big advocates for you know making sure open source is around and competitive um and you know first that means not banning it which there are bills out there particularly at the state level that want to put in you know not maybe not explicit bans but deacto bans. So like for example California had a bill that would have would have created unlimited downstream liability for software developers which would have effectively killed open source. So that's step number one and then I think step number two is you know are the incentives there to create open source. I think I watched a uh interview I think it was a dwarfish interview with Satcha from Microsoft recently who it was a really good interview. Um he argued that open source will always exist because enterprise customers always demand at least one kind of open source alternative like they'll just they'll they'll end up funding it. Okay. Um and that's why you always see kind of this proprietary open source um you know combo. But then you have you know Facebook is doing with Llama. I don't know if they'll continue to do that. There are some startups doing it. You know China has been very into open source. Maybe that's a kind of a national strategy. Maybe that changes at some. Maybe you do it at first to kind of create attention in kind of marketing and then you change it. Um, you know, I wish there were more uh, you know, it's just the thing with AI that's different than operating systems. Like with operating systems and databases, you just needed a bunch of coders sitting around. With AI, you need massive capital expenditure to to train the models. Um, so I just don't know long I think it's an unknown question long term. Are there good steadystate funding models for open source? I think a possible outcome which I think is pretty good outcome is open source is just always a little bit behind like the way open AI is now releasing older models. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's probably a fine outcome like for startups to exist for consu you know we want consumers to get inexpensive healthcare advice you know the the next best model in 5 years will probably be good enough for most startups. it will probably be good enough. And then for the, you know, super high-end stuff, you people pay for it. And maybe that's a good outcome, a good kind of equilibrium state. Maybe that's where we're headed. I I hope so. Um I think it would be I think it would just be a bad outcome if you had four companies that had, you know, just vastly better closed source technology and could effectively, you know, kind of charge rent to consumers and startups. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It's interesting. I think a lot about the early ethos of Android, which felt like it matched Google's sort of open web mindset and then when it became clear that iOS was beating their pants off by being a closed ecosystem, Android became very closed and started to mimic the sort of closed iOS strategies. So, we'll see what happens with Meta and Llama if they sort of replicate that. But that that's a worrying dynamic. I think that the more optimistic case is that we haven't yet seen the same sort of app platform feedback loop and the lockin that you get from the foundation models. So you know there is sort of a case for them to continue to release the next best model and for the models to be somewhat substitutes for each other. Um so far yeah the Android case is a good kind of I think cautionary tale right because I I think maybe in some technical sense some of the code is open source but it deacto isn't right all the services everything else like you need permission um and it was one where yeah where they kind of made lots of overtures that way um so that would be yeah that would be the worry but it does seem I think it feels a lot better than it did three years ago or something with the China the China open source stuff the yeah policy stuff is better we're see you know the fact that that open AI is doing older models. Like it's it seems like we're in a better spot for open source. I think some of the also the scaremongering that like a chatbot's going to murder everyone or something is like literally zero people have died from chat GBT so far as far as you know it's just the whole you know so I think that maybe people are chilling out on and um so it feels like we're in a much better spot. I'm cautiously optimistic on open source. Yeah. 2 years ago the conversation was a lot about you know if OpenAI is the only game in town over time they take all the economics of the compliments and it doesn't feel like that's happened which is you know to your point in that amazing book about ballooning it feels like that's why there's a lot of interest in acquiring IDs because they understand that like if the foundation models start to become more interchangeable they're going to have to move upstream and own you know userf facing economics amazing well Chris thank you so much it's great to hear you talk about sort of consumer and AI and and all the implications Um, and we're we're super thankful to have you at the firm. Well, thank you. Thank you. This was fun.
