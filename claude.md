# Podcast Analysis Viewer - Development Journal

## Project Overview
Create a programmatic podcast analysis viewer that takes TXT and MD file pairs and generates a beautiful web interface.

### File Structure Requirements
- **TXT files**: Contain metadata (title, channel, published date, duration, views, URL) and raw transcript
- **MD files**: Contain formatted analysis with guest info, key quotes, contents, sections with quotes and analysis

### Original Requirements
- Sidebar that auto-detects channel names and organizes episodes
- Main page with beautifully formatted content from MD files
- Dynamic title/channel detection from TXT files
- Format: "Title | Channel" with metadata (Published: Date • Duration: Time)
- Fully programmatic (no hardcoding)

## Development Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Functionality (Initial Implementation)
**Date: 2025-08-28**

#### File Structure Analysis
- Analyzed existing podcast files in `output/` directory
- Found 57 episodes across 22 different channels including:
  - The Rest Is Politics, Lex Fridman, All-In Podcast, Ringer Movies, etc.
- Each episode has corresponding `*.txt` and `*_claude_artifact.md` files

#### Python Script Development (`podcast_viewer.py`)
Created comprehensive `PodcastAnalyzer` class with:

**Metadata Extraction:**
```python
def extract_metadata_from_txt(self, txt_file: Path) -> Dict:
    # Regex patterns to extract:
    # - TITLE: Episode title
    # - CHANNEL: Podcast channel name  
    # - PUBLISHED: Publication date
    # - DURATION: Episode length
    # - VIEWS: View count
    # - URL: YouTube/source URL
```

**Content Processing:**
- Automatic MD file pairing with TXT files
- Markdown to HTML conversion with extensions
- Episode grouping by channel
- Chronological sorting (newest first)

**HTML Generation:**
- Complete static website generation
- Responsive design with modern CSS (Inter font, CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- JavaScript for dynamic episode loading
- Mobile-responsive sidebar navigation

### ✅ Phase 2: Design & Styling Enhancement
**Date: 2025-08-28**

#### Advanced CSS Implementation
**Modern Design System:**

```javascript
function showEpisode(episodeIndex) {
    // Update active states
    // Process and enhance content formatting
    // Handle special sections (Guest, Key Quotes, Contents)
    // Update main content with loading animation
}
```

**Sidebar Functionality:**
- Collapsible channel groups with smooth animations

### ✅ Phase 4: Mobile Experience Optimization
**Date: 2025-08-28**

#### Advanced Mobile Controls
**Professional Mobile Menu:**
```html
<button class="mobile-menu-toggle" aria-label="Toggle menu">
    <svg><!-- Professional hamburger icon --></svg>
</button>
```

**Sidebar Behavior:**
- Hidden by default on mobile (≤768px breakpoint)
- Slides in from left with smooth animation
- Dark overlay prevents background interaction
- Body scroll locking when menu is open

**Multiple Close Methods:**
1. **X Close Button**: Appears in sidebar top-right corner
2. **Overlay Tap**: Clicking outside sidebar closes it
3. **Episode Selection**: Auto-closes after choosing episode
4. **Keyboard**: Escape key support
5. **Resize Detection**: Auto-closes when switching to desktop

**Enhanced Interactions:**
- Toggle button hides when sidebar is open
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Proper touch target sizing (44px minimum)

## Technical Architecture

### File Processing Pipeline
